 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan 

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,900
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,640
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,480
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,120
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,160
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,500
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,460
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,148
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,080
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,000
♫  Follow the tempo, set yourself free  ♫

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,700
♫  The illuminated night sky guides me to success  ♫

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,560
♫  I'll accompany you as you bravely take flight  ♫

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,280
♫  My love still burns passionately   ♫

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,040
♫  Shining in the smiling eyes  ♫

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,190
♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,970
   

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,869
   

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,140
Remember Director Zheng from B&amp;C Motors?

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,840
The one who tried hitting on you at that dinner party?

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,450
She's been working her team to the bone,

23
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,470
a total cancer in the business!

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,970
She's Lin Jia Dong's aunt.

25
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,875
Those two have the same tastes, don't they?

26
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,670
So, you knew this all along, but still kept him around. Why?

27
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,582
Weren't you worried he'd stab you in the back?

28
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:18,240
Lin Jia Dong isn't exactly a saint, but I doubt he's involved in this matter.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,320
He's just indecisive; makes it easy to use him.

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,600
You're quite considerate.

31
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,110
So, how much damage was there?

32
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,260
Just a couple of computers.

33
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,390
They're idiots.

34
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,610
Breaking our computers won't slow us down.

35
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,100
The data has been in the cloud forever.

36
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,200
If anything, it lit a fire under the team.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
Now the team spirit is absolutely unshakable.

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
That's good to hear.

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,450
Try this.

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,970
Too much sodium.

41
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,920
Bad for my heart rate.

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,200
Then try this.

43
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,670
Full of allergens. I could have a reaction.

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,620
What's wrong?

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,330
I didn't say there was a problem with this one.

46
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,500
Bitter melon.

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,250
It's bitter. Not exactly lucky.

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,832
TCM, Western Medicine, and omens, we take everything seriously, right?

49
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:35,940
I guess so.

50
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,650
- Then, I... 
 - I prepared this one for you.

51
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,100
Protein, carbs, vitamins. Perfect balance. You deserve that.

52
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:46,468
I'll try it.

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,230
How is it?

54
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:55,220
- This takeout... 
 - Takeout?

55
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,500
I made it all myself.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,120
No wonder it's so good!

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,240
For real?

58
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,360
But I've got something even better than take out.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,470
What?

60
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,930
Come here.

61
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,862
You...

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,670
Where'd you pop up from?

63
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,960
I've been here this whole time.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,760
You two were so busy being lovey-dovey, you forgot I exist.

65
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,620
Where' did you pick up that line?

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,760
It's okay. Just pretend I'm invisible.

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
I don't mind.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,130
You... You're not feeling well?

69
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,080
Your head hurts, right? I'm calling a doctor!

70
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,770
- I'm fine! 
 - No way, your brain's priceless!

71
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,544
Really, it's nothing.

72
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:05,010
Seriously, he's not made of glass.

73
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,940
Sister, you've been here this whole day.

74
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,770
Anyone would think he'd suffered major trauma.

75
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,810
Little girl, what do you know?

76
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,413
I can see you're not some wise old lady either.

77
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,540
Stop acting like one.

78
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,470
Listen, kid, I'm way more mature than I look.

79
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,210
What about you? Shouldn't you be doing homework

80
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,860
instead of scrolling on your phone?

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,690
I guess your teachers don't give you enough.

82
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,900
Just say the word!

83
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,060
I'll bring you college entrance exam prep books next time I come.

84
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,450
As many as you want.

85
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,020
Just let me know.

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,501
Your girlfriend is so fierce.

87
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,411
You'll get used to it.

88
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,540
What time is it now?

89
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,330
Why? Got plans?

90
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,500
Besides me, who else is coming to visit?

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,660
I'm just sleep.

92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,160
It feels like time for an afternoon nap, right?

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,291
That works.

94
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,212
Then when you finish eating, get some sleep.

95
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:03,540
I'll head back to campus.

96
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,740
The competition's been keeping me so busy

97
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,010
I can't even keep up with classwork.

98
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,100
That sounds tough.

99
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,870
I'll root for you from here.

100
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,870
How about I feed you?

101
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,100
I can feed myself. I was doing fine!

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,720
You weren't picking the food up well.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,810
Okay, fine.

104
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,300
You forgot I was here again?

105
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:26,919
I thought she said she didn't mind.

106
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,269
I'll do it myself.

107
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,597
Okay then. I'm heading out.

108
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:34,090
Go on, don't worry. See you tomorrow.

109
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,720
See you tomorrow.

110
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,520
I'm off.

111
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,080
Bye-bye, don't worry.

112
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,010
Eat up.

113
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,790
I'll clean the plate.

114
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,500
 Sorry, you really can't go in. 

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,690
 They're in a meeting. 

116
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,260
Sorry, you really can't go in.

117
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,010
Investment of 1.2 million...

118
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,810
What's wrong with you?

119
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,810
Director Zheng hates being interrupted during a meeting!

120
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,390
Xiao Lin, long time no see.

121
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,450
Take him to the reception room.

122
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,640
Don't bother.

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,410
I need to show Director Zheng something, then I'll leave.

124
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,700
This is last night's security footage.

125
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,530
Turn that off!

126
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,870
I know Director Zheng hates being interrupted.

127
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,250
Likewise, Team Jinghai University feels the very same way.

128
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,540
I have no idea what you mean.

129
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,540
You don't need to understand.

130
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,130
But if you guys pull another stunt like that,

131
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,990
this video won't just stay on my phone,

132
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,920
it will appear all over social media.

133
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,080
Maybe Director Zheng doesn't care about her reputation,

134
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,160
but I bet B&amp;C Motors does.

135
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,192
Kiddo, don't tell the nurse 
    

136
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,810
I slipped out, okay?

137
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,100
No way! The nurses and older sister told me to keep an eye on you.

138
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:55,140
Are you stuck on that question?

139
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,720
Here.

140
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,450
I'll help you out if you keep my secret.

141
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,850
Deal?

142
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,770
Are we living in the Stone Age?

143
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,190
I can always find an answer online.

144
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,310
I don't need to trouble you.

145
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,740
   

146
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,140
Messi's Legendary Journey?

147
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,840
Book cover trick?

148
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,300
- I'm telling your mom. 
 - It's not a trick!

149
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,440
It's THE legend, you know? A legend.

150
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,360
How about this?

151
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,190
You keep my secret,

152
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,340
and I'll tell you when Messi wins his next title.

153
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,040
Why would I believe you?

154
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,980
Smart! You even know how to fact-check first.

155
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,850
In a few weeks, in the World Cup qualifiers,

156
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,790
China beats Korea 1-0 for their first win.

157
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,350
Come on, at least make up a good story.

158
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,730
If you gamble on it, it's no loss for you.

159
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,730
What if it's true?

160
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,540
You seriously know when Messi wins a title?

161
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,060
Here.

162
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,810
   

163
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,820
For real?

164
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,740
For real! Don't let anyone else see that.

165
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,210
Where are you going?

166
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,420
Citizenship and Conduct Assessment is about to start.

167
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,540
Can I skip it?

168
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,570
I want to watch the national team make us proud.

169
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,041
What, you're planning to retake it again? 
    

170
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,590
Why even watch that match?

171
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,880
We're going to lose anyway.

172
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,910
True.

173
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,100
- Come on, we're going to be late. 
 - Let's go.

174
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,710
Take Lin Jia Dong down in this round, or nobody leaves. Got it?

175
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,874
- Okay. 
 - I'll finish this up within five minutes.

176
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:02,190
I don't want to miss the qualifiers.

177
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,020
Let's do this!

178
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,520
Beat Lin Jia Dong in five minutes?

179
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,002
That would be humiliating.

180
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:08,200
Three minutes, tops.

181
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm can't miss the anthem before the game starts.

182
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,611
Here comes the soon-to-be loser.

183
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,780
Senior Brother Lin, welcome back from the hospital!

184
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,750
Show me your firewall source code.

185
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,340
What do you think? Pretty ironclad, right?

186
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
Check this out.

187
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,550
Isn't this our source code?

188
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,260
It's all out in the open now?

189
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,070
Posted half an hour ago.

190
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,512
I'm guessing that we didn't fully clean our computers after that last incident.

191
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,390
Someone took it.

192
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,790
Last time, our computers got smashed to pieces,

193
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,070
we salvaged what we could.

194
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,640
Something must have slipped out.

195
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,180
You don't think they recovered our hard drive data, did they?

196
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,260
What now, Xuejiao?

197
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,790
The internal-team comparison is about to start.

198
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,180
There's no time to re-code.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,810
- Grandmaster, you're here! 
 - Senior Brother!

200
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,370
Don't worry, we're fully prepared, ready to go.

201
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:19,160
 Are you scared to watch me lose this competition? 

202
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,680
Hello, Gu Xuejiao.

203
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,610
Hello, Shu Lan.

204
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,480
Hello, Wen Bo.

205
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,790
Hello, the rest of "Nobody Cares".

206
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,550
I'm Zhao Fei Fei.

207
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,280
This is Si Qi.

208
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,300
Whatever.

209
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
After this match, we won't be seeing you anymore.

210
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,610
Did you leak our firewall source code?

211
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,660
What are you saying?

212
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,870
Everyone's seen it.

213
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,790
You've all seen it?

214
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,440
   

215
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,090
 Help me reach out to the teams on this list. 

216
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,810
 Get me details on their contracts with B&amp;C. 

217
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,880
This is well-written.

218
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,450
It's a shame it was leaked.

219
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,270
Your perfect code is now scrap paper.

220
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,730
Such a waste.

221
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,020
How about this?

222
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,690
Merge the two teams.

223
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,160
But I'm afraid that would be like mixing oil and water.

224
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,670
You rascal, you already have an idea, don't you?

225
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,060
I do have a suggestion.

226
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,380
For this competition, Professor Tan is heading the judging panel.

227
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,040
Also, to keep it fair, we've got a mystery guest judge.

228
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,660
Next, I'll announce the new rules.

229
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,140
Due to unforeseen circumstances affecting one of our competing teams,

230
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,297
based on Professor Tan's instructions,

231
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,712
the format's shifting from smart-device control

232
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:59,210
and attack/defense to precision strikes on distributed server nodes.

233
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,610
Forget about your firewalls, attack only, no defense.

234
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,052
With the school's approval,

235
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,040
Professor Tan will repurpose all idle classroom PCs

236
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,330
during this afternoon's Citizenship and Conduct Assessment.

237
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,280
They'll form a local network of distributed server nodes.

238
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,000
Both teams must precisely locate the judges' PC

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
hidden in a matrix of hundreds of campus computers,

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,300
then hack and take over its smart-device simulator.

241
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,330
All PCs run the same simulation program

242
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,310
with dozens of randomized countermeasures and dynamic IPs.

243
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,970
Zero hints provided.

244
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,520
Pure tech skills only.

245
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,710
The first team to break in and take control

246
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,400
wins the competition.

247
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,420
No limits on any offensive tactics.

248
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,910
Attacks must stay inside the campus LAN.

249
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,900
All the campus PCs are ancient.

250
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,400
Shu Lan, mask your laptop as the OS server

251
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,940
and push system update requests to every node.

252
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,450
Once you've logged all their system versions,

253
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,430
launch zero-day attacks on the targets.

254
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,550
A quick reminder, everyone.

255
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,400
Among all distributed nodes, only one is your real target.

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,090
Waste time on the wrong machines, and you...

257
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,240
Check this one in Lab 1, something's off.

258
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,980
Check this out.

259
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,940
Where?

260
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,580
On it.

261
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,780
Okay.

262
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,090
Team China's doing great.

263
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,940
Maybe they'll surprise us.

264
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,960
- Look! 
 - Really?

265
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,580
Send it over.

266
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,800
   

267
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,040
   

268
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,520
The exam's started.

269
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,060
I'm good here. 
    

270
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,161
How about you? Have you got the wire tapped and ready?

271
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:53,001
Can you hijack it? Keep working on the hijack, okay?

272
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:55,650
- Alright. 
 - Your target...

273
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,830
Bro, hack into that LAN.

274
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,902
On it.

275
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:01,180
Send us the short list.

276
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,850
Okay.

277
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,280
   

278
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,231
Old Tan, I think we've been spotted, right?

279
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,380
That's right.

280
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,330
A team nailed this exact classroom.

281
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,124
Looks like we've got a winner.

282
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,304
Let's see who it is.

283
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,480
   

284
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,670
Hi.

285
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,450
Xiao Lin has really improved a lot over these past few years.

286
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,990
It appears Gu Xuejiao's has to work harder.

287
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,090
Yes! We won!

288
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,590
- Made it! 
 - Winner!

289
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,780
We won!

290
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,367
- Yes! 
 - Bro!

291
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,570
We're getting hacked back!

292
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,120
What?

293
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,380
Putting your face on the big screen?

294
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,015
That scared me.

295
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,575
Let me show you something better.

296
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,390
 Chief Lin, your team made a clean breach into the judges' PC. 

297
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,720
That means you still have got 2. Impressive, I'll give you that.

298
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,340
But our team hacked every computer in the building at the same time.

299
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,760
You go for precision, I go for brute force.

300
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,860
Good thing you walked right into the trap we planted.

301
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,230
Otherwise this wouldn't have been such a blowout.

302
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,730
Uh, technical glitch!

303
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,940
Everyone, don't watch!

304
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,170
Turn in your papers, now!

305
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,780
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

306
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,550
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

307
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:56,400
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫ 
 ♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

308
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,730
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

309
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,760
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

310
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,390
Nice shot!

311
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:11,722
Nice!

312
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:13,282
Goal!

313
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,640
Team China!

314
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,750
Great goal!

315
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,390
What's happening?

316
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,950
Go, China, go!

317
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
- Let's go! 
 - Team China, go for it!

318
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,590
Team China, go for it!

319
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,360
Come on!

320
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:35,799
Looks like he's picked his side.

321
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,609
So, judge, who's your winner?

322
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,720
- I'll pass. 
 - What?

323
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,520
You little punk.

324
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,790
Do you hear that crowd outside?

325
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,180
They're the real judges.

326
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,870
We won!

327
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,200
We won!

328
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,860
Why are you clapping?

329
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,390
Shouldn't we toss the captain in the air?

330
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,940
Where's the captain?

331
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,369
Where's Xuejiao?

332
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,930
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

333
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,840
Congratulations!

334
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,760
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

335
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,560
This victory is for you.

336
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,610
You're the brain behind the intrusion strategy, right?

337
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,820
No work talk during our quality time.

338
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,470
Okay.

339
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,610
Awesome job!

340
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,002
What reward do you want?

341
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,390
I'll decide later.

342
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,390
Take a breath and rest a bit.

343
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,490
Get some real food?

344
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,040
Deal.

345
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,200
Where's the remote? Where's the remote?

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,010
- Put away your phone. 
 - Put your phone down.

347
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,960
Stop recording!

348
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,280
We're all adults here.

349
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,520
What's the big deal?

350
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,830
- What are you doing? 
 - I want to take a video.

351
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,210
Stop staring, single guy.

352
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,703
- Find the remote! 
 - Let's go!

353
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,870
- Hey! 
 - Find the remote.

354
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,430
Hey, my phone!

355
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,850
Start.

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,830
You start.

357
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,150
Why aren't you eating?

358
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,921
So, primates evolved the sense of smell

359
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:10,922
so they could identify rotten food in the wild.

360
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:13,303
Don't worry; it''s a legit product.

361
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,293
It won't kill you.

362
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,870
Well, you try it first.

363
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,316
It's better if you go first.

364
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:20,637
Here, I'll feed you.

365
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:22,693
No, I'll feed you.

366
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:23,790
Here.

367
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,520
Time to prove your love.

368
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,620
Don't.

369
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,460
I'll do it myself.

370
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,710
That figures. Going beyond your limits has to be done step by step.

371
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,920
- It's good? 
 - Yes.

372
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,670
Half a bowl.

373
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,200
You didn't leave me a single bite!

374
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,630
I was just trying to push you out of your cautious bubble.

375
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,280
I can't believe I overdid it.

376
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,725
I can tackle this junk on my own.

377
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,635
No need to drag you into it.

378
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,530
No way. This doesn't count.

379
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,920
Then what does?

380
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,660
Want me instead?

381
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,340
No!

382
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,790
Primates, you know, evolved the sense of smell

383
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,581
to detect rotten food in the wild,

384
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:46,406
not to eat luosifen (rice noodles in a river snail and pork broth) and kiss me.

385
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,466
Then, it's time to prove your love for me.

386
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,440
I scared you?

387
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,610
No. It stinks.

388
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,635
What's going on?

389
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,445
No idea.

390
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,920
I'm in a bad mood. Let me stay here a few days.

391
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,580
You guys, carry on.

392
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,760
Brother Rui, you've been here the whole time?

393
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,720
I just woke up. I came out for some water.

394
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,170
I didn't see a thing. You guys go ahead.

395
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,630
So, rough night?

396
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,280
Whatever.

397
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,210
I just...

398
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,360
don't understand.

399
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm fine.

400
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,450
Doesn't look that way to me.

401
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,800
You guys just carry on.

402
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,150
I'll get the door.

403
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,250
You're here too?

404
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,520
 Hello.   

405
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
 It's me, Gao Rui. 

406
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,450
 Are you okay now? 

407
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,180
 Thanks for taking care of me last time. 

408
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,760
 It's nothing. I lost my phone. I'm using a backup now. 

409
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,140
 I was just afraid that you couldn't reach me if you needed to. 

410
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,790
 Here's my new number, do you want to save it? 

411
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,870
 Got it, thanks. 

412
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,260
 - Bye then. 
 - Hang on! 

413
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,280
 There's one more thing. 

414
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,700
 Go ahead. 

415
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,100
 Well, uh, your earring fell off at the... 

416
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,680
 I've got it here. 

417
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,131
 I can drop it off whenever it's convenient for you. 

418
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:04,000
 Earring? 

419
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,790
 We'll see. I've been really busy lately. 

420
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,050
 Oh, if it's easier, I can just have it delivered. 

421
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,790
 I have another call. If there's nothing urgent, I'll hang up. 

422
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,100
 No, it's urgent! This..this is urgent! 

423
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,860
 Hello? 

424
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,310
Slippers are here!

425
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,870
You can put your purse there.

426
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,010
I've got a few things to wrap up.

427
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,250
Just make yourself at home.

428
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,230
What's going on?

429
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:40,280
Xuejiao.

430
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,300
I knew I'd find you here.

431
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,870
Congratulations, little rock star!

432
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,240
Thanks, Sister Yue!

433
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,480
Petal's been stressing about this competition thing nonstop.

434
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,630
He was so worried you'd be so sad if you lost.

435
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,060
But now it's all good, happy ending!

436
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,450
By the way, I talked to everyone on that list you sent me.

437
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,420
Here's their information.

438
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,520
What list?

439
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,250
Well, I won't crash your alone time.

440
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,380
Anyway, I was just passing by.

441
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,570
 Wow! 

442
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,320
You're in a 3-person world?

443
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,630
I'm leaving.

444
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,700
You're leaving?

445
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,745
What now? Do something!

446
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:34,250
Sister.

447
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,845
- We're out of... 
 - Soy sauce!

448
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,145
Can you take Gao Rui to buy some?

449
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,730
Understood.

450
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,420
Let's go.

451
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,110
Yeah, I see.

452
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,830
 But the more money the industry raises, 

453
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,830
and prepares to deploy,

454
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,210
and the more it is open to ordinary investors.

455
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,330
the more pressure will come from regulators to improve transparency.

456
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,740
Okay, call you later.

457
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,765
Sister, you've been pretty busy lately, huh?

458
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:19,280
Swamped.

459
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,370
Laying the groundwork for your startup team takes a ton of paperwork.

460
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,904
So you're still thinking of me, right?

461
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:28,644
What does that mean?

462
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,110
Well, after that night, I tried calling,

463
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,720
but you kept dodging me.

464
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,400
So I wondered if maybe I performed poorly that night.

465
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,000
What do you remember from that night?

466
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,532
That night, things got kind of blurry and we just...

467
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:17,380
Well, next morning, I woke up feeling guilty.

468
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,630
But don't worry, I'll definitely take good care of you.

469
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,310
Who needs you to take care of them?

470
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,520
No, no. I'm a guy. Of course I will take full responsibility.

471
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,370
Xiao Gao, I think you might've gotten the wrong idea.

472
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,387
Wrong idea?

473
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,910
What's there to misunderstand?

474
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,180
S...So...

475
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:47,390
that ¥300 you left me that night...

476
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,680
Was that hush money?

477
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,280
Hush money for what?

478
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,090
That was for a cab to take you home.

479
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,350
I think now I've figured out what's going on with you.

480
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,250
Listen. First, I didn't do anything to you that night.

481
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,760
Hitting on my brother's friend would be way out of line.

482
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,390
You were just too drunk, and I was worried about you.

483
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,010
So I took you to a hotel.

484
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,100
Second, I didn't mean anything by looking out for you.

485
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,590
It's only because Xiao Lin got you hurt once before.

486
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,090
As his sister, it's only right that I took care of you.

487
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,830
Third, I'm not the kind of woman who plays games like that.

488
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:35,870
So, please get that idea out of your head right now.

489
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,520
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

490
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,040
I'll just get out up ahead there.

491
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,750
Your stuff.

492
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,860
Thanks.

493
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:14,073
 This year's National College Intelligent Security Competition Preliminaries 

494
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:15,280
 have successfully concluded. 

495
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,971
 The prelims used a mix of group matches and round-robin rounds. 

496
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:21,350
 From Group A, the long-time powerhouse Jinghai University. 

497
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,450
 And from Group F, the dark-horse UFE, 

498
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,870
 Both punched their ticket to the final. 

499
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,511
This edit is amazing!

500
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:31,002
It's got me all fired up!

501
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,080
Totally!

502
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,870
Come on, here's to our most esteemed MVP!

503
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,590
Someone commented,

504
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,680
"Who says geeks can't be gorgeous?

505
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,340
Jinghai's captain proves them wrong."

506
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,820
Xuejiao, you're totally stealing the spotlight!

507
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,910
Too bad no one was allowed to watch the prelims in person.

508
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,660
Otherwise, I'd have been there with my camera,

509
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,320
snapping you from every angle.

510
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,620
Can I come to the final?

511
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,390
Oh, come on! Give me a break.

512
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,390
Besides, your bubble tea shop is so busy.

513
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,110
When would you find the time?

514
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:10,285
But speaking of the final, you're facing Zhou Shiyun.

515
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,086
Who'd have thought you two

516
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:14,866
would end up as rivals after all this time?

517
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,640
Thinking back to high school,

518
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,380
this is going to be a drama-packed showdown.

519
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,630
Drama? Seriously?

520
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,260
This is a championship match, and you're thinking about drama?

521
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,070
Didn't you hear the host?

522
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,380
She said Jinghai University is the long-time powerhouse,

523
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,820
while UFE's the dark horse.

524
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,570
Plus, you're the team captain, and she's just a regular member.

525
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:38,140
It's pretty clear who's got the edge between the two of you.

526
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,660
I guess there's no room for drama then.

527
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,180
You sound like you're disappointed?

528
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,340
I'm already exhausted running my shop all the time.

529
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,290
Now I can't even enjoy some drama.

530
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:54,000
it's all your fault for being so darn good.

531
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,240
Still, Zhou Shiyun making the final is impressive.

532
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,830
I can't underestimate her.

533
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:09,420
In my heart...No. Objectively, you're still the best.

534
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,550
Okay. Then, you just keep making the money,

535
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,820
I'll bring us the glory.

536
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,280
You? Just remember to take care of me when I'm old.

537
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,970
Deal!

538
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,240
Out of beer. I'll go get some more.

539
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,250
I know you're good, but with the final coming up,

540
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,460
don't get too carried away.

541
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,030
The last bottle.

542
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,670
Okay.

543
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,430
Two beers.

544
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,390
Xuejiao.

545
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,250
What a coincidence!

546
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,860
Long time no see.

547
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,380
The final is soon; just relaxing while I can.

548
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,440
You guys too, right?

549
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,390
Shiyun's team is totally on edge...

550
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,760
The committee hasn't released any details yet.

551
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,100
But word is, the challenges are tougher than ever.

552
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,940
Sounds like it's going to be brutal.

553
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,740
But, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

554
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,320
We'll find a way, as always.

555
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,360
You sound really confident.

556
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,490
Well, it's true. The final is almost here and you still have time to eat out.

557
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,350
Aren't you here too?

558
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,740
I saw the video of your team's match.

559
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,830
You gave clear calls the whole time, and your team worked great together.

560
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,900
Great job.

561
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,230
I'm glad we're facing your team in the final.

562
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,908
Even though we've known each other forever,

563
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,738
I still won't go easy on you.

564
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:38,038
What a coincidence. Neither will we.

565
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,820
Just wait and see.

566
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,670
Pick up my tab.

567
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,000
   

568
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:56,230
Are you... feeling upset?

569
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,520
No.

570
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,620
She's Jinghai University's captain,

571
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,945
I'm just a regular JUFE member.

572
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:03,326
What right do I have to feel upset?

573
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:04,972
Just to be clear beforehand.

574
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:07,752
Even though Xuejiao and I are siblings by blood,

575
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:10,050
I never spoke up for her.

576
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,480
So don't take it out on me.

577
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,940
Oh, should we grab some snacks for your roommates?

578
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,670
What Gu Xuejiao said is exactly right.

579
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,610
The more things change, the more they stay the same,

580
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,230
It is just the same game in a different skin.

581
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,320
Nothing to stress over.

582
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,150
I'm glad you see it that way.

583
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,800
Your team's way too tense.

584
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,230
You barely even take time to eat.

585
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,030
Just watching you guys gives me stomach cramps.

586
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:42,800
So, in the final, who're you rooting for,

587
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,740
Xuejiao or me?

588
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,390
Both of you.

589
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,270
Only one can win. Who do you choose?

590
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,820
Well... I pick you!

591
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,360
You hesitated.

592
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
I'll definitely pick you.

593
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,520
The final is open to spectators.

594
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,410
Want to come watch?

595
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,800
I just happen to have a few extra tickets.

596
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
There's no point in wasting them.

597
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,800
Uh... I have plans for that day.

598
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,970
Alright then, forget it.

599
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,400
Boss, we're ready to order.

600
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,230
Coming!

601
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,248
   

602
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,300
   

603
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,520
    
    

604
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,840
   

605
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,220
Sugar's good for calming the nerves.

606
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,320
Congratulations!

607
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,800
You talked your way into the final, carried by your team.

608
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,750
My bad luck.

609
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,320
If we'd faced you in round one,

610
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,490
you'd be in the audience chilling right now.

611
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,110
If it were a bragging contest, I'd lose hands down.

612
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,150
What a pity. It's not.

613
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,710
 Attention all contestants, 

614
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,550
 the competition's about to begin! 

615
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,230
- Ready, everyone? 
 - Ready!

616
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,260
Ready!

617
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,350
Three, two, one, go!

618
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,840
Welcome to the very first National Intelligent Security Competition.

619
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,070
I'm your guest commentator today,

620
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,770
game designer, Gu Mingze.

621
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,360
Just call me Mingze.

622
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,920
Today we'll be using B&amp;C Motors' newest smart car,

623
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,710
a model loaded with cutting-edge autonomous driving technology

624
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,190
for an unmatched driving experience.

625
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:54,040
Ladies and gentlemen, the NISC final starts now!

626
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,630
This round's arena is split into a free-battle zone and a scoring zone.

627
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,360
The ultimate goal is to use remote-control technology

628
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,620
in a cyber offense-defense battle to seize control of the car.

629
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,330
We've already got a team breaching the vehicle's security system.

630
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:20,480
- I told you it'd only take ten seconds. 
 - Blue Team scores.

631
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,760
The score is now 0-1.

632
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
 

633
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,000
Nice!

634
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,710
- Sway to the left. 
 - I'll cover the right.

635
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,160
Blue scores again!

636
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,490
Red puts one on the board.

637
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,750
Wen Bo, hold your side.

638
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,227
Okay.

639
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:43,280
Blue scores again.

640
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,790
The score is now 1-5 
    

641
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,230
Keep it up, guys!

642
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,510
Not bad! That was close, you totally saved us!

643
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,070
Piece of cake.

644
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,220
Xuejiao, something's off.

645
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,420
How is JUFE injecting commands faster than our firewall can process?

646
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,010
- Let me check. 
 - Same here.

647
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,510
- Don't panic, I'm checking. 
 - The data's not moving.

648
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,300
It's frozen.

649
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,820
Let me check.

650
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,760
It looks like there's a problem with Jinghai University's data commands.

651
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,110
Red scores.

652
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,150
- Can you block it? 
 - No.

653
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,110
No way, Xuejiao, it's dead.

654
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,960
- Red scores again. 
 - Good!

655
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,800
I've been attacking their flag nonstop, but I can't break through.

656
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,880
Red scores.

657
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
The score is 4-5. 
    

658
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,960
So, Mingze, who do you think has the upper hand?

659
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,440
Take it easy. It'll be okay.

660
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,100
Personally, I think

661
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,690
Jinghai University has standout individual skills across the board,

662
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:45,332
but in terms of potential, I'd say JUFE... 
    

663
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:46,840
- Red scores! 
 - Yes!

664
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,050
We're tied, 5-5!

665
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,440
Red's closing the gap!

666
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,880
JUFE's straight-up taunting Jinghai University, aren't they?

667
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,920
Jinghai University calls a timeout.

668
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,440
Any issues on your side?

669
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,010
I can't see any problem.

670
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,110
What about you?

671
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,340
No issues here either.

672
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,170
Then why are we bleeding points like this?

673
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,670
We've run these plays forever,

674
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,780
same offense, same defense, old playbook.

675
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,650
It's not like they have cutting-edge tech.

676
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,110
Then it's not the machine.

677
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,340
So, it's a human issue?

678
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,740
It's the remote control signal.

679
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,490
This router came from the organizers.

680
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,750
I checked it before the match.

681
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,390
- Pull it up, quick. 
 - I'm on it.

682
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,220
- Easy! 
 - Be careful!

683
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:36,300
   

684
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,380
We need you to send the vehicle's command logs to us.

685
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,580
Pull up the logs.

686
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,320
Lin Jia Dong's sent the logs!

687
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,400
What's going on? Packet loss rate is over 50%?

688
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,550
It's a hardware issue.

689
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,600
I'll talk to the organizers.

690
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,560
What's going on?

691
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,300
Look.

692
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,940
According to the rules,  there's no swapping hardware mid-match.

693
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,590
If you think the race isn't running smoothly,

694
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,220
you'll have to fix it yourself.

695
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,220
I've checked it a million times, I still have no idea what's wrong!

696
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,990
Feels like my time at Jinghai University was a total waste.

697
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,960
Come on, think of something.

698
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,415
Signal?

699
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:21,380
Packet loss?

700
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,010
I tried. No luck.

701
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,630
- We've basically got this won. 
 - Really?

702
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,410
Guaranteed.

703
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,400
Shu Lan, got any gum left?

704
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,590
How much do you want?

705
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,260
All you've got.

706
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,478
I've got some here.

707
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:43,440
Me too.

708
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,400
Zhou Shiyun, great observation and analysis, kudos.

709
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,650
You'll be MVP if we take the championship.

710
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,310
Thanks, Captain.

711
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,090
Alright. Start sticking.

712
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,420
What is Jinghai University's team doing over there?

713
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,300
Are they losing it under the pressure?

714
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,880
I have to remind you, Jinghai University players,

715
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,230
you've only got ten minutes left!

716
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,355
Done. You go.

717
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:09,815
Go, go, go!

718
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,640
- Signal's back yet? 
 - Lin Jia Dong, shift right a bit.

719
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,040
- Got it. It's working! 
 - We've got speed.

720
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,260
-This signal booster is... 
 - It's working!

721
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,230
- We made it! 
 - So cute!

722
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,670
Nice one, Xuejiao!

723
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,070
Don't go easy on them now.

724
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,300
Got it.

725
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,720
Watch me take them down.

726
00:42:29,202 --> 00:42:30,803
Blue scores again!

727
00:42:30,803 --> 00:42:32,320
I've got to their flag.

728
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,728
Pull it back fast.

729
00:42:33,728 --> 00:42:34,880
Don't let their wheel spin.

730
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
Blue puts another point on the board.

731
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,171
No worries. I've found their weak spot.

732
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:41,251
- Go this way. 
 - Got it.

733
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,830
Blue scores!

734
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:13,030
