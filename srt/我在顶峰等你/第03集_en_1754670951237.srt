1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The flowers that bloom under the snow

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,700
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,300
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,100
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,700
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,500
Follow the rhythm and gently release

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,200
The night wind is lighting up the way

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,700
The bright smile

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,300
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,500
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sister.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're still not home?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How did you know Hua Hua?

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I...

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm her tutor.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I usually teach her.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You agreed to teach me?

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, I asked her to prepare a chair.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's great.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then you can take these things.

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
What?

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
It's written on it.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
This is human body.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
This is also human body.

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
And this is the east worm and the summer grass.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Anyway, it's all yours.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
You agreed to help us with the tutor.

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Then we must show our gratitude.

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
You can take these things.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Take good care of your health.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
The Long Ballad

36
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
How about I make you a ginseng first?

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
To train your senior.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
She's a student of my class.

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
She's a few years younger than me.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Okay, okay. I know.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
But I think you really need to make up for it.

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Look at what you've been busy with lately.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
You're so haggard.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
I can't stand it anymore.

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Let's talk about it.

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Don't make a scene.

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Then I'll be straight.

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Your parents are going back to China in a few days.

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
They're having a shareholders' meeting.

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
You must warmly welcome them.

51
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,000
They're coming back to have a shareholders' meeting.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,500
You're welcome.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
What am I doing?

54
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
We're welcome at the company.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're welcome when you're home.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You've been living at home for years.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How cold it is.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
When Uncle and Aunt come back,

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
this house will be full of laughter.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't need the key at the door.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Remember to wait for her.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then tell me when the date is set.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then I'll find someone to clean up these two days.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To welcome them home.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
When they come back,

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll go back to live in the dorm for a few days.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm going to sleep.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hello,».

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why isn't한 Jiao up yet?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The child has been太上心 nearly every day lately.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He is exhausted.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He takes the supplement from last time on the Monday.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Look at the period.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The newly issued crackers are for Jiaojiao.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Offer me on that day.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Never think about that.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But you have to give the kid.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Afterfairer? You must give me it.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Beforefairer!?

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Go on.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,640
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,680
Dad, I'm still young.

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm too stupid.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,400
I have to finish the college entrance examination

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,200
early today.

87
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,960
I'll leave you to it.

88
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,720
I'll go first.

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Okay.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,240
Hello, students.

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,320
Hello, director.

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,760
When you're in the first year,

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,640
you can be innocent and romantic.

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
When you're in the second year,

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,280
you can be happy.

96
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
But you can't be in the third year.

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,640
Because when you're about to

98
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,920
rush and work hard,

99
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,200
you can't be happy.

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
You can't be happy.

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,120
I need you to

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,600
ask yourselves.

103
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,920
Did you get the admission form?

104
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
No.

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,000
Who said no?

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,720
Why hasn't he come yet?

107
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,440
Why hasn't the monitor come yet?

108
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,920
Is he going to the toilet?

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
I think he knows

110
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,240
he's going to be on stage.

111
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,400
He's nervous.

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
He's nervous.

113
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,240
You don't know him.

114
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,000
With his background,

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
he finally got a

116
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,760
chance to perform in the first year.

117
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
He's a climber.

118
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,120
He's a climber.

119
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,680
You're a little more careful.

120
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,960
Yes.

121
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,120
Director, look at him.

122
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,000
Luo Man and Luo Lan once said

123
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,000
there's only one kind of heroism

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,320
in this world.

125
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,720
That is the essence of recognizing life.

126
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
I still love life.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,760
I hope you can recognize the essence of learning.

128
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,280
I still love learning.

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,520
For one goal,

130
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,600
I'll take the final exam.

131
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,840
So,

132
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,520
everyone,

133
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
be strong and long.

134
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,440
You can reach the future.

135
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Don't talk too much.

136
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Next,

137
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
let's welcome

138
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,680
the student representative to speak on stage.

139
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,240
Hello, teachers and students.

140
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Hello.

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm Zhou Shi Mi, the student representative of Class One.

142
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,320
Concentrate on the beat.

143
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Don't leave.

144
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,440
The time of death.

145
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Next, let's welcome the student representative of Class 8, Class 3, to come up to the stage to say a few words.

146
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Director, Director.

147
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Look.

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm sorry.

149
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,440
The representative of our class is on the playground.

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
He's flying here.

151
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Look, look.

152
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
He's on the playground.

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
How can you be late?

154
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
He's flying.

155
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Look, he's coming.

156
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
That one?

157
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Hurry up.

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Hurry up.

159
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Hurry up.

160
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Hurry up.

161
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Hurry up.

162
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Hurry up.

163
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Hurry up.

164
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Xue Jiao.

165
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Xue Jiao.

166
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Xue Jiao.

167
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Xue Jiao.

168
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Hurry up.

169
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Hurry up.

170
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Xue Jiao.

171
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Gu Xue Jiao?

172
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Why are you here?

173
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Mr. Zheng.

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Come here.

175
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Come here.

176
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Come.

177
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Come on.

178
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Xue Jiao.

179
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Xue Jiao.

180
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
What's going on?

181
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
What's going on?

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
How can the student representative be late?

183
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Did you forget to bring your watch?

184
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I brought it.

185
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
I don't know what it is.

186
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Do you want to go up and give a speech?

187
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm so hot.

188
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Go.

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Come on.

190
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Welcome the student representative of Class 38 to give a speech on stage.

191
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Go.

192
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Go.

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Go.

194
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Go.

195
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm so hot.

196
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Hello.

197
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I'm Gu Xue Jiao from Class 38.

198
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
OK.

199
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Thank you.

200
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Go for it.

201
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
My college entrance exam is...

202
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
is...

206
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
is...

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
is...

208
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440

209
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
is...

214
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
is...

215
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
To make you feel sorry for yourself,

216
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
I welcomed a foreign student.

217
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Although he is just a certain foreign student,

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,040
only nonachiable students like you

219
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
will be the right guys.

220
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
He Kapoor died their whole life for a man.

221
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
He has been a good-looking official for five years.

222
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,140
If it wasn't for Yi Tian Yu,

223
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
he would be the end of the world,

224
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
and it might be a fact.

225
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
The night Magic

226
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,120

230
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,840
Ready to join?

231
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,760
I want gold eggs.

232
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,480
Come on!

233
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Come on!

234
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Come on!

235
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480

236
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Come on!

237
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
What's wrong?

238
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
What's wrong?

239
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,640
Don't say that.

240
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
That's...

241
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
It's not me. It's him.

242
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
What did I say?

243
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
What did you say?

244
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
It's him.

245
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm so stupid.

246
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
He's so stupid.

247
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
What did you say?

248
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I didn't say anything.

249
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Who said that?

250
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
I didn't say anything.

251
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Who said those things?

252
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,640
Hesecondary

253
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,280
I heard that you're gonna join the army.

254
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
You said

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,800
it won't be super to manys TV.

256
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,640
My dad said

257
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
that school communication malfunctioned.

258
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Don't be fooled.

259
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,640
ige Has Mint

260
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,480
After hard meditation,

261
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,320
So I opened it up in a year.

262
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:54,200
Hey,

263
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,720
Your veelt maintenance works are excellent.

264
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,280
Your problems are working hard.

265
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,440
We'll side by side.

266
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,840
About what the old doctor says is true,

267
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,640
but what matters now

268
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,440
is whether the health check up is good

269
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
He's also making money.

270
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,920
He's not as miserable as he is now.

271
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,040
Now it's better.

272
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,400
The savings are in.

273
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,880
The borrowed money is also in.

274
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,560
What should we do?

275
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,840
Will we live well in the future?

276
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,240
Our experts are saying

277
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
that it's a good time now.

278
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't miss the opportunity.

279
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,920
Why do you believe everything others say?

280
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,840
What's wrong?

281
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,600
Sit down.

282
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,640
Be quiet.

283
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,480
Sit down.

284
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
Sit down.

285
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
What do you need?

286
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,640
I need you.

287
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
Hello.

288
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,520
I'm glad to meet you.

289
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,440
маг Wen Zhe

290
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,480
Last time I met you in the bookstore

291
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,360
This ugly doll will only make me continue to do evil dreams.

292
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,280
No, no, no. Let's not listen.

293
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,120
This is a doll that I carefully selected to combine the two ugly dreams.

294
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
How can you say that about her?

295
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Lin Yun Shi...

296
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
You... I...

297
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,440
You're not the first to be punished.

298
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
You're the first to be punished. Say it.

299
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,280
I... I... I...

300
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,440
I only have a small, small request.

301
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,880
Help me go to the parent meeting.

302
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,520
Is this a small request?

303
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Just once. I'm begging you.

304
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,880
Can you bear to see me being criticized by the teacher in front of the whole class

305
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,560
and being alone among the parents?

306
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,120
I can bear to see it and I'm happy to see it.

307
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,440
Then I'll have to trouble you to go to the scene.

308
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll go first.

309
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,960
Don't try to get in my way.

310
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,560
I'm not going.

311
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Look over there.

312
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
That's Shi Tou! I'm begging you!

313
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Please take care of him.

314
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,360
Here.

315
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Okay.

316
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,960
I heard that the goal of our class is to have children.

317
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
This goal is too far away.

318
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Come, come. Get to know each other.

319
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,200
A big shot.

320
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,200
You don't have to be afraid of the big project. Just look for a big shot.

321
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,000
We all know each other by fate, right?

322
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,800
We all have been through school.

323
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
We all work in the project.

324
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,160
Hey, big brother.

325
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,440
Old... Old brother.

326
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,440
We all work in the project. Call me if you have work.

327
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Dad.

328
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Dad.

329
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm sorry. I was wrong. I thought it was my dad.

330
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Gu Xue Jiao, when did you get into the market?

331
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
How come I didn't know?

332
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm preparing to retake the first class.

333
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I've been studying too hard lately.

334
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm too bad at studying.

335
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
No, he's been studying without leaving the mouth.

336
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,200
He's taking medicine.

337
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Hello, Xiao Gu.

338
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm Tianyu's father, Yi Da Fa.

339
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,160
I'm not afraid of...

340
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,200
You're not afraid of the big project. Just look for Yi Da Fa.

341
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
He's got a lot of progress.

342
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
This kid is so good.

343
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
This kid is so good.

344
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Is there no seat here? Can I sit?

345
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Open it.

346
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Back then, no matter how I fought with Yi Tianyu,

347
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
it was all my dad's decision.

348
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Dad, you were once a man of glory.

349
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Xiao Gu, is your parents here?

350
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
My parents...

351
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't talk nonsense.

352
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
You...

353
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Your dad is so young.

354
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm his uncle.

355
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Uncle Qing.

356
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
This uncle looks like a talent.

357
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I'll leave a contact information.

358
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Yi Da Fa.

359
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Thank you.

360
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Why did you suddenly call Zi Bei?

361
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Do you have the heart to see me

362
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
in front of the whole class?

363
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I don't have the heart.

364
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Parents, let's do this.

365
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
It's almost time. Let's sit down.

366
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Okay?

367
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Then, let's go out.

368
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Come.

369
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Come, move faster.

370
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Wait for your mom.

371
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Okay.

372
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Yi Cai, let's play a game.

373
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
I'm not going.

374
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Why not? I already brought my ball.

375
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
My dad still doesn't know

376
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
how many points I got last time.

377
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
He'll know soon.

378
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
What if I get a brain hemorrhage?

379
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Fine.

380
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I'll keep an eye on you.

381
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Gu Xiao Xiao.

382
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
What are you doing?

383
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Let's go.

384
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
You're a student.

385
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
You're using a small phone.

386
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
You're not telling me.

387
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
This is a temporary thing.

388
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
You're looking for someone

389
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
to tell you.

390
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
We've finished the mobilization meeting

391
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
two days ago.

392
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Some of you have a big goal.

393
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Some of you are more practical.

394
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
I believe that

395
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
you have a clear goal

396
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
in your mind.

397
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Right?

398
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
What goal?

399
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
How about this?

400
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Let's talk about it one by one.

401
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Teacher, I heard that

402
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
our goal is to have a child.

403
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
That's too far away.

404
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Right.

405
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
We've made a big goal.

406
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
It's like

407
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
half of the goal.

408
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
That's a bit far.

409
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I don't know if you've heard of

410
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
the positive effect.

411
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Those who have a big goal

412
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
will be more successful

413
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
while pursuing it.

414
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I don't think it's funny.

415
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
If all the goals

416
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
are achievable,

417
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
then life is over.

418
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
You passed, Xiao Ying.

419
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Who's parents are so talented?

420
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
What?

421
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
You don't understand, do you?

422
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I don't.

423
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I suddenly remember that

424
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
I'm a genius.

425
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Right.

426
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
You can be generous.

427
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
You can be ambitious when you start something.

428
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Remember it.

429
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I think the parent said

430
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
very well.

431
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
We often say that

432
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
parents are the foundation of children.

433
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Parents' heights determine the height of children.

434
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
So I think

435
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
the goal is a bit higher.

436
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
It's not a bad thing.

437
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
This time, your Shiyun

438
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
is really amazing.

439
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
She doesn't need a tutor.

440
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
We never

441
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
care about her studies.

442
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
She's the only one who can do it.

443
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
She's smart.

444
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Not only smart, she's pretty.

445
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
She's her mother.

446
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
No.

447
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Yunyun.

448
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Mom.

449
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I just talked about you.

450
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
You're going to help the teacher again?

451
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Okay.

452
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
See you later.

453
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Bye.

454
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Bye.

455
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Mom, I'm done.

456
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Do you want to go home together?

457
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
What home?

458
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Take your teacher's gift

459
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
in the car.

460
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
So many subjects.

461
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
You can speak English.

462
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
You really wasted so much money.

463
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Shiyun.

464
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
How is it?

465
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Is it reliable?

466
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
What reliable?

467
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
That night, I helped you

468
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
to cover up for the school.

469
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm not exaggerating.

470
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
It's a double test

471
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
of physical strength and intelligence.

472
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I was in between two rooms

473
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
and I was in between two gender.

474
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
You mean that night

475
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
when Jiaojiao was with me?

476
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Yes.

477
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Did you see the parent meeting?

478
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
My mom asked me to bring you a message.

479
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Parent meeting?

480
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
You don't know?

481
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Yes.

482
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
But I'm in the secondary school.

483
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Our class doesn't open.

484
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
But the class is over.

485
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
My mom left.

486
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Did you leave late?

487
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
No.

488
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
My mom talked to this and that.

489
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
She talked about the class.

490
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
She talked to this and that.

491
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
She talked too much.

492
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
You should talk more.

493
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Your daughter is so good.

494
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
She should be so famous.

495
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
She's famous.

496
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
What does it have to do with me?

497
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
How can it have nothing to do with you?

498
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
You're so good.

499
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
It's your mom's pride.

500
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Am I really good?

501
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
You're not good.

502
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Who else deserves the word good?

503
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
What's good about me?

504
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You're pretty.

505
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
And pretty.

506
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
They all mean the same thing.

507
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
What else?

508
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
And...

509
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
And...

510
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Shi Yu, why are you here?

511
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Mom is looking for you everywhere.

512
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Aren't you her brother?

513
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Why are you here?

514
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I like to be here.

515
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
You didn't dig this place.

516
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
You're friends?

517
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I don't know.

518
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
You can only grow up when you have a big heart.

519
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
You can only grow up when you have a big heart.

520
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
You can only grow up when you have a big heart.

521
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
This is great.

522
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
This is great.

523
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Xu Jiao, you're back so early.

524
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Yes.

525
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
It's early today.

526
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I want to buy some reference books at the bookstore.

527
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Why did you buy a new computer?

528
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
This is our baby.

529
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
It's our baby.

530
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Yes.

531
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
You didn't...

532
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Zhou Yizhang recommended us a potential share.

533
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
We didn't expect it.

534
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
We didn't expect it.

535
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
We took all the money from home.

536
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
We borrowed 30,000 from your grandma.

537
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
We invested all.

538
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
What did you give her?

539
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
This is happy.

540
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
What's that look?

541
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
It's...

542
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
The expert of the stock market is Zhou Shuyun's dad.

543
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
The expert of the stock market is Zhou Shuyun's dad.

544
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
He can avoid the parent meeting.

545
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
He can't avoid the dark.

546
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Is this the life?

547
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
No.

548
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
There must be a way to save him.

549
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
There must be a way to save him.

550
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Mo Xie can be so poor.

551
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
6003135.

552
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Which one is not good?

553
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I have to buy this one.

554
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm going crazy.

555
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
I'm going crazy.

556
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm so unlucky.

557
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm so unlucky.

558
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm so unlucky.

559
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
6003135.

560
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I knew it.

561
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I knew I would buy Xianglin's stock.

562
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I knew I would make a lot of money.

563
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
The stock of the crazy father is 135.

564
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Is Xianglin's stock

565
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
134 in the front

566
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
or 136 in the back?

567
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
It's all fate.

568
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
It's all fate.

569
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Is it 4 or 6?

570
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Is it 4 or 6?

571
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Is it 4 or 6?

572
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
It's 6.

573
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Six coins, four sea clothes,

574
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
mountain of the mountain,

575
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
300 miles of the sky,

576
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
you can't even memorize the first sentence.

577
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
You can't even memorize the first sentence.

578
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Take it back and make up for it.

579
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
I didn't mean that.

580
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
You underestimate your ability to teach.

581
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
You underestimate your ability to teach.

582
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
What do you want?

583
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
You don't even know the 4 or 6.

584
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
I...

585
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm listening to my parents.

586
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
First, take out the middle one.

587
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Why?

588
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
The K line

589
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
is to write the D on the forehead.

590
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
You know the stock?

591
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
I know a little.

592
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Then help me see which one

593
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
is the best.

594
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
I can help you.

595
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
But you don't follow the rules.

596
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Especially you.

597
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
This one.

598
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
So careless.

599
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Believe it or not,

600
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
you can't beat me.

601
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
You believe it?

602
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Gu.

603
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Uncle.

604
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Why are you here? What a coincidence.

605
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
What a coincidence.

606
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
No one teaches you.

607
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Help that kid

608
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
find some books.

609
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I don't understand.

610
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Your kid.

611
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Uncle, I'm leaving.

612
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Sorry.

613
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I just recommended some books.

614
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
I didn't expect uncle to buy them all.

615
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Listen.

616
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Even if you ask him to move the book store,

617
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
he has to move it.

618
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
What about you?

619
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Why do I need to see it?

620
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I can take it back to the desk.

621
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Gu.

622
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Pick another one for him.

623
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
We have enough money.

624
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I want him to learn a little bit.

625
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Buy the book.

626
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Hello.

627
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Isn't this Xiaojiu?

628
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Why are you working here?

629
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
He works part-time in the bookstore.

630
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
He is the master of the show in Jingda.

631
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Jingda is great.

632
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Great.

633
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Brother, come on.

634
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Pick two books.

635
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
You must be the best.

636
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
I dare not. Can you finish it?

637
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
I'll kill him.

638
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
You can't open a house with just one book.

639
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Okay.

640
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Xiaojiu, Gu.

641
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Thank you for your help today.

642
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Bye, uncle.

643
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Bye.

644
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
They call me uncle all the time.

645
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
When can we get rid of

646
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
our family relationship?

647
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Soon.

648
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
They are so enthusiastic.

649
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
What's your relationship with Yi Tianyu?

650
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
What else?

651
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Just an ordinary classmate.

652
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I remind you, the college entrance examination is coming.

653
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Don't be so serious.

654
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
I can't be serious.

655
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I can't be serious.

656
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
You'd better go to the inkwell.

657
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Hello.

658
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Hello, order.

659
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
What's your number?

660
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
25.

661
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
How nice it would be if I had a daughter like you.

662
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Dad, you have good taste.

663
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Your father is a genius.

664
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Your mother knows it.

665
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
My grades are

666
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
the best in the whole school.

667
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
He is better than me.

668
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
He is the second best in the whole school.

669
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Why didn't you say so earlier?

670
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Is he

671
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
the apprentice of the bookstore?

672
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
No, no, no.

673
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
He is good.

674
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
He is smart.

675
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
He has my style.

676
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
He can do business.

677
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
He can make money.

678
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
6013136

679
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
6013134

680
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I can't get into the school.

681
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
No.

682
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I've never been wrong since I was a kid.

683
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I have to find an outsider.

684
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Why are you going out at this time?

685
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Be quiet.

686
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I'll keep the door for you.

687
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm busy.

688
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Brother,

689
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
you can do it.

690
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
You help your parents choose one.

691
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Where can I do it?

692
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Every time,

693
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
you are one point behind in the score line.

694
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
No one is better than you

695
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
to be the top student in the industry.

696
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I choose.

697
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Okay, okay.

698
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm sorry.

699
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
This one.

700
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Bye.

701
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
6013136

702
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Then you help me to see

703
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
which one is the best.

704
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Really?

705
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I win.

706
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
6013134

707
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
I choose you.

708
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
There seems to be someone on the board.

709
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Who uses my code?

710
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Not good.

711
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I choose you.

712
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
You are really

713
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
good at this.

714
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Brother,

715
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
family doesn't say good things.

716
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Moreover,

717
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
the government will be established in a few years.

718
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
When you have these equipment,

719
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
you are a pair of broken shoes.

720
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Mine is yours.

721
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Yours is everyone's.

722
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
What do you want?

723
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I help you to pay the price.

724
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Your equipment

725
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
is 8,000 yuan in total.

726
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Plus my

727
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
3,000 yuan in total.

728
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
11,000 yuan in total.

729
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
8,000 yuan in total.

730
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
There is an anonymous account.

731
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
An anonymous account

732
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
posted this video on the school forum.

733
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
What anonymous account?

734
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
This video is just

735
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
to print Chen Xiao's name.

736
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
You are right.

737
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
You have ruined his good things twice.

738
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
He must be thinking about revenge.

739
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Is your idea correct?

740
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
What is the victim's guilty theory?

741
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
The justice defense is not wrong.

742
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
It's them who are wrong.

743
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
I don't know what is guilty.

744
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Let's apologize to them.

745
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Why do they keep being bullied?

746
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Because they think bullying is not worth it.

747
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
They always want to be bullied.

748
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
But they only get hurt.

749
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
I have tried many times.

750
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
But the school is strict.

751
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
If things go bad, it's over.

752
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
There will be a way

753
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
to get to the top.

754
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Besides, I have something to do.

755
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I don't have time to participate in their fight.

756
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
What is it?

757
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Brother Ling, where did you meet him?

758
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
The secret monster.

759
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Hurry up.

760
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
What's going on?

761
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
What are you doing?

762
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Xu Jiang's phone.

763
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Give Xu Jiang's phone back.

764
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Give it back.

765
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
What are you doing?

766
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
The teacher is here. Hurry up.

767
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Gu Xuejiao, what are you doing?

768
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Gu Xuejiao,

769
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
come out with me.

770
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
You can't give her a good lesson.

771
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
I can't.

772
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
She is always in the cup.

773
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
It's okay.

774
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
But you have to be careful.

775
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Tell the teacher

776
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
about it later.

777
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Ms. Yin, you go ahead.

778
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
You go ahead.

779
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Okay.

780
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Talk to her.

781
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Mr. Fu.

782
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Look at this video.

783
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Mr. Fu,

784
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I've seen this video.

785
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
You can be so rational.

786
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
She...

787
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Mrs. Fu, this way.

788
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Come in.

789
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Mrs. Chen Xiao is here.

790
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Mr. Fu,

791
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
my child was bullied at school.

792
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
The school must punish her.

793
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
No one should cry.

794
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
No one should be reasonable.

795
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
You are so uneducable.

796
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
You have no sense of remorse.

797
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
I didn't do anything wrong.

798
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Why should I?

799
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
You beat me up like this.

800
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
You said you were right.

801
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Nose shadow powder.

802
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Even the color number is the same as mine.

803
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Your arm is dirty.

804
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Let me wipe it for you.

805
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Why do you hurt me?

806
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Why does it hurt?

807
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Look, isn't it dirty?

808
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
My arm is dirty.

809
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
The evidence is here.

810
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Don't try to deny it.

811
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
The school must deal with it seriously.

812
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Otherwise,

813
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I'll go to the Education Bureau.

814
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
The Education Bureau is not owned by anyone.

815
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
But, Chen Xiao's mom,

816
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
don't worry.

817
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
We will find out the truth.

818
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Chen Xiao,

819
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
don't exaggerate.

820
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
You have to tell me the truth.

821
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
Then indeed it is a difficulty for the school.

822
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Good girl, Chen Xiao!

823
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:17,420
ُ

824
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
You need my help.

825
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Oh!

826
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,340
I'm sorry.

827
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,740
Gu Xue Jiao, you're too much!

828
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,940
Are you okay, Shi Yue?

829
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,540
What does it have to do with Xue Jiao?

830
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,100
What's going on?

831
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,860
Don't know. They're blocking.

832
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,460
They're blocking?

833
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,980
Bastard!

834
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,500
Is there anyone who bullies his classmates like that?

835
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,380
What do you mean?

836
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,100
Who bullies who?

837
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,660
Can you talk?

838
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,900
You can't go to class and play, okay?

839
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,380
Yu Tianyu!

840
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,220
What's going on?

841
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,860
Yu Tianyu!

842
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,780
Yu Tianyu!

843
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,500
Yu Tianyu!

844
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,580
Oh!

845
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,460
Can you stop fighting?

846
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,420
Little gays!

847
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,580
Can you be careful of the stones?

848
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,380
No, no, no.

849
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,220
It's okay.

850
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,740
What are you doing?

851
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,500
No, wait.

852
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,820
Can you stop fighting?

853
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,140
Be careful of the stones!

854
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,100
Be careful of the stones!

855
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,300
No.

856
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,460
It's about to fall.

857
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,860
No.

858
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,260
It's about to fall.

859
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,900
It's about to fall.

860
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,500
It's about to fall.

861
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,260
It's about to fall.

862
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,780
Oh my god!

863
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,540
What's wrong with you?

864
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,900
Come on, get up.

865
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,060
Who hit you?

866
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,020
Director.

867
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,700
Xue Jiao didn't mean to hit me.

868
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,580
Don't blame him.

869
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,420
Don't run.

870
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,020
Stop!

871
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,620
Stop!

872
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,220
Stop!

873
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,220
Stop!

874
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,820
Stop!

875
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,220
Stop!

876
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,620
Hold tight.

877
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,020
Gu Xuejiao!

878
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,820
What?

879
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,420
Why...

880
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,020
Why is it you?

881
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,020
No, I didn't hit him, director.

882
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,100
I can explain it to you.

883
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,740
Director.

884
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,660
Director.

885
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,940
I can testify for him.

886
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,140
Look!

887
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
What does it have to do with you?

888
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:27,740
Li Zheng!

889
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,340
Don't beat him.

890
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,980
When will your parents arrive?

891
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,660
Director.

892
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,380
My dad came to school

893
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,420
longer than he came to work.

894
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,460
He's already dead.

895
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,340
He's afraid of boiling water.

896
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,420
Please wait a little longer.

897
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,740
Director.

898
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,820
My parents are usually busy.

899
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,860
I can handle this little thing myself.

900
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,980
What's with your attitude?

901
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,260
It's a small thing to cause trouble.

902
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,540
It's a big deal to kill people and set fire, right?

903
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,540
Director.

904
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,260
I came to school twice a day.

905
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,860
He's the only one who's made trouble.

906
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,140
The school must give an explanation.

907
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,060
Yes.

908
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,980
Aunt.

909
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,380
Don't blame Xue Jiao.

910
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,780
He's my best friend.

911
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,220
How could he hit me with a ball?

912
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,180
It must be a misunderstanding.

913
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,100
Your kid is kind-hearted.

914
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,060
He's like this.

915
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,740
You still protect him.

916
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,060
I'm sorry.

917
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,180
I'm sorry to have to do so many things at the bank.

918
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,220
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

919
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,380
Director.

920
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,860
He's working here personally.

921
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,100
Dad.

922
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,620
The number of students you came to school

923
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,420
is even smaller than that of our PE teacher.

924
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
I want to find you too.

925
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,260
Let's have a meal together.

926
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,300
Gu is here too.

927
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,500
That brat is a hero.

928
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,500
Dad.

929
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,300
What are you talking about?

930
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,220
He saved me.

931
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,860
I'm really different from others.

932
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,540
Father.

933
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,980
What's your attitude today?

934
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,140
Let's have a meal together.

935
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,740
No.

936
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,940
I quit.

937
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,020
It's a fate to meet

938
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,660
our parents through students.

939
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,140
Here.

940
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,500
Take this.

941
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,780
This is my contact information.

942
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,660
Right?

943
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,620
I don't think there's anything

944
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,500
that can't be solved with money.

945
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,580
Our school doesn't do this kind of thing.

946
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,980
Then we'll do whatever you say

947
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,380
if it's solved.

948
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,340
Anyway, Gu's part is also mine.

949
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,780
Dad.

950
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,420
Uncle.

951
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,380
You don't have to plead for me.

952
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,100
Deputy Director.

953
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,220
I didn't hit him.

954
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,140
You really came out of the class.

955
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,740
You're not telling the truth.

956
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,540
Please pay attention to your words.

957
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,100
This kid has such a bad psychological endurance.

958
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,340
Did you say that?

959
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,220
Does it hurt?

960
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,940
No.

961
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,380
It hurts.

962
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,060
Look.

963
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,020
Deputy Director.

964
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,380
I have evidence to prove that I'm telling the truth.

965
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,340
Tell us.

966
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,460
We all saw it.

967
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,100
Zhou Shiyun was heading in the direction of Deputy Director.

968
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,900
He threw a ball from my position

969
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,620
and fell on Zhou Shiyun along the throw line.

970
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,780
We all know

971
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,180
the direction of the ball is the point of the ball.

972
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,660
If I threw the ball,

973
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,580
why did Zhou Shiyun

974
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,060
fall in the direction of Deputy Director?

975
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,540
Shiyun.

976
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,780
You always say we're best friends.

977
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,700
Can we go back to the scene

978
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,580
and show it to everyone again?

979
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,620
Group 1

980
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,620
Mr. Zhu Freeze

981
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,100
I'm sorry We have to go.

982
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,180
I...

983
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,980
...

984
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,660
The sound of the bell

985
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,660
The separation of memories

986
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,660
The steps that every line made wrong

987
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,660
It's us thinking of each other

988
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,660
Let fate be destined

989
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Let us give up all courage

990
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,660
I'm willing to travel with you through time

991
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:43,660
If you also understand the secrets in my eyes

992
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,660
You will find that you have always been in my heart

993
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,660
I try to open my arms

994
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,660
Because of the love, I'm sure

995
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,660
I'm waiting for you at the peak

996
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:13,660
No matter how strong the wind is, it doesn't matter

997
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,660
There is a sound very close

998
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,660
I know it must be you

999
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,660
I try to open my arms

1000
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Because of the love, I'm sure

1001
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,660
I'm waiting for you at the peak

1002
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:51,660
No matter how strong the wind is, it doesn't matter

1003
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,660
There is a sound very close

1004
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:02,660
I know it must be you
