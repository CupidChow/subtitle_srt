 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan 

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,920
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,680
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,560
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,200
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,320
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,080

♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,860
   

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,720
Xuejiao, try our shop's new drink.

21
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,110
Tiantian.

22
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,190
You're a real lifesaver.

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,030
How did you know the glycogen in my brain was running low?

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,170
Haven't you already made it?

25
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,430
Why are you still working so hard?

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,670
Because I have to.

27
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,590
Everyone is a genius.

28
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,920
Someone mediocre like me can't even get enough credits.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,920
I wanted to join a lab, but I was turned away by the doorkeeper.

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,130
I have to do something.

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
Autonomous driving.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,270
- Isn't the autonomous driving lab the one that Senior Brother Lin is in? 
 - Yes.

33
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,480
So why can't you get in?

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,570
Ask Senior Brother Lin for a favor and take you in.

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,710
Now everyone thinks I'm unmotivated.

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,220
If I force my way into the lab with Lin Zhihua's help right now,

37
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,380
even he would look down on me.

38
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,280
And I bet that doorkeeper would continue bullying me.

39
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,540
I also don't want to become the kind of person I despise the most.

40
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,960
Fine.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,520
Keep it up, then.

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,360
I'll add more sugar to your milk tea next time.

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,150
Keep it up. You got this.

44
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,080
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

45
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,200
♫  Block out the AC, sofa, and soft drinks  ♫

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,400
♫  Block out the games, TV, and posters  ♫

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,320
♫  Block out the yawning as a sign from heaven  ♫

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,900
♫  Block everything that is of no importance  ♫

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,980
♫  Block out the ridicule from outsiders  ♫

50
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,240
♫  Block out the powerless prayers  ♫

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,060
♫  Block out the meaningless slogans  ♫

52
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,240
♫  I'll march towards my destination no matter how precipitous the task  ♫

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,200
♫  I'll overcome any difficulty I'll meet  ♫

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,340
♫  Although troubles always outnumber the solution  ♫

55
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,300
♫  Even if I fall, I fall with grace  ♫

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,640
♫  Whether life can be restarted   ♫

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
♫  I can't say for sure  ♫

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,900
♫  If I fail again, I won't be sad  ♫

59
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,280
♫  No more invasions of laziness  ♫

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,480
♫  There is no secret manual to life, so let's ignite it  ♫

61
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,500
Thanks, Tian...

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,119
Tiantian said the bookworm had low blood sugar.

63
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:55,709
So I brought you some sweetness.

64
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,990
Thanks.

65
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,710
Drink it.

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,420
Drink it yourself.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,012
- Where are you going? 
 - To the library.

68
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,301
Let me walk you there.

69
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:15,140
- There's no need. 
 - Come on, let's go.

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,810
What are you studying today?

71
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,570
Let me see.

72
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,680
You don't need to walk me over. Go back now.

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,350
Or you won't be able to find seats on the bus.

74
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,400
It's okay. Actually, I drove here.

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,440
 Aren't you charmed? 

76
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,110
 Hurry up and ask. Ask me if I can take you for a drive. 

77
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,960
 Ask me. Hurry and ask me... 

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,590
Be careful about getting a parking ticket.

79
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,500
That's impossible.

80
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,910
   

81
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,570
Is she a fortune-teller or what? 
    

82
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,530
Xuejiao, I'll come back to find you later.

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,092
Programming languages aren't just for writing software programs. 
    

84
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,150
Even in daily tasks like database management,

85
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,760
we can write small programs to streamline workflows

86
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,520
and boost efficiency.

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,830
Next, I'm going to show you

88
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,990
some commonly used database auxiliary programs.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,880
- What's going on? 
 - Why is this program carrying a virus?

90
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
 How dare such a petty virus 

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,270
 cause trouble in Professor Tan's class? 

92
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,150
Professor Tan studied computers his whole life,

93
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,890
but ended up getting disturbed by a virus.

94
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,885
Does anyone know how to solve the problem?

95
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:47,006
 So this is the programming test for freshmen that Lin Zhihua mentioned? 

96
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,470
- Isn't this... 
  - This is a textbook virus. 

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,640
 It originated from an introductory test  
    

98
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,390
 for programming at a university. 

99
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,390
 But in ten years, 

100
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,440
 only one person has managed to remove the virus. 

101
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
 This year, someone finally announced the solution. 

102
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,400
 Next, I will explain this solution 

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
 and show you how it's done. 

104
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,880
 Wait. 

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,390
 It was updated based on the previous virus. 

106
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,520
 But the underlying logic is the same. 

107
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,000
 It alters the software's underlying call parameters 

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,580
 to trigger crash conditions through vulnerability exploitation. 

109
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,840
I think you better stop wasting your time.

110
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,640
What are you doing?

111
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,690
The class isn't over yet.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Professor Tan, may I use your computer?

113
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,110
She figured it out?

114
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,150
No way.

115
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,530
Who does she think she is?

116
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,120
I think this virus added a string of data to the database,

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,470
which led to a memory overflow that triggered the crash.

118
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,390
- Makes sense. 
 - Please explain more.

119
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,270
This virus should only be triggered under specific conditions.

120
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,150
Understanding this logic enables us to derive an algorithm

121
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,270
that performs binary XOR operations on the system table's permission data,

122
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,710
and then updates it while bypassing malware trigger conditions.

123
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,080
Professor Tan, please carry on with the lesson.

124
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,710
After class, I will scan your computer with antivirus software.

125
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,110
Not bad.

126
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,320
Wait.

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,370
Leave my book here.

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,780
S-Sorry.

129
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,910
All right, let's continue.

130
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,470
Turn to page 181.

131
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,390
Xuejiao, can you show me your algorithm after class?

132
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,440
- Okay. 
 - These are all just theories.

133
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,540
Read them by yourselves.

134
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,620
Okay. That's it for today.

135
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,310
Class dismissed.

136
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,640
- I'll take this then. 
 - Remember to bring your homework next time.

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,710
 Okay. 

138
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,720
Gu Xuejiao, right?

139
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,330
- Bye, Professor. 
 - Bye.

140
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,390
Would you like to be my class representative?

141
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,150
Is this a reward?

142
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,590
The class representative gets bonus points on academic performance.

143
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,760
Can I ask for something else as a reward?

144
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,250
What is it?

145
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,150
I'd like to join your elective course in the lab.

146
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,830
Not bad. You have the courage to sign up for that as a freshman.

147
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,760
You also removed the virus and received points.

148
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,640
As far as I can remember, only one person has done that.

149
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,980
You're going to test the freshmen again?

150
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,720
It has been the same trick for years.

151
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,990
You did it to me when I was a freshman.

152
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,160
We must emphasize the security of the programming environment.

153
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,860
I'm exploring their potential.

154
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,280
You're updating the virus?

155
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,250
Because you cracked the program.

156
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,530
This time, I must up the game.

157
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,900
   

158
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,920
   

159
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,370
Go ahead.

160
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:33,870
Who said I can't pass the first test of Professor Tan's programming course?

161
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,800
Who said I haven't yet placed myself in the position of a college student?

162
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,060
And who said I shouldn't consider joining the lab?

163
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,560
Check this out.

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,080
Freshman lab member.

165
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,900
Impressive.

166
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,470
But do you have to be so excited like you won the lottery?

167
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,960
You're not the first freshman

168
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,630
who's been admitted to the lab.

169
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,920
I know.

170
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,350
The first one was you.

171
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,110
I'm the second.

172
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,800
Senior Brother Lin, what a nice provocation tactic.

173
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,630
It almost drove me crazy.

174
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,840
But since you are my senior,

175
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,230
I will continue to be a humble and prudent freshman colleague in the lab.

176
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,980
Please take good care of me.

177
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,590
Now we're talking.

178
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,420
Welcome to the lab.

179
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,510
Also, maybe I'm even better than you.

180
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,200
The virus has been updated, but I still removed it.

181
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,990
How do you know it's been updated?

182
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,230
You're just a freshman who barely took any courses.

183
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,200
I... I was eager to join the lab.

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,110
So I did my homework.

185
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,230
Let me find the wealth position in the lab.

186
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,080
That's where I'm going to sit.

187
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,670
Don't take it lightly. It's not so easy to complete this course.

188
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,230
How did you sneak in?

189
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,990
Get out. You think you can just come in here?

190
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,590
Hello, Senior Brother. I'm Gu Xuejiao from the Class of 2015, majoring in AI.

191
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,900
It's my first day here.

192
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,400
I successfully enrolled in Professor Tan's programming practice elective course.

193
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,080
From now on, we'll see each other a lot in the lab.

194
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,990
Please take good care of me.

195
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,680
Didn't I fail you in the interview?

196
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,750
Who let you in?

197
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,360
I did.

198
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,697
Grandmaster?

199
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:36,130
I called you here because of this.

200
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,230
No one has signed up for Professor Tan's elective course for years.

201
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,610
She's the only one this year.

202
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,509
He wants you to help with her paperwork.

203
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,679
Okay, I'm on it.

204
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,470
Let me tell you. It's easy to join us, but hard to complete the course.

205
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,350
I don't care what tricks you pulled to get in.

206
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,470
The real challenge is to actually complete the course.

207
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,080
I'm willing to bet that your chances

208
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,060
of failing this elective course are 99.999%.

209
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,660
Let's wait and see.

210
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,040
- I'm melting. 
 - You're back.

211
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,110
It's almost autumn.

212
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,590
Why is it still so hot?

213
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,200
Just turn on the AC for a bit.

214
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,350
Fine.

215
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,990
A calm mind naturally brings coolness.

216
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,230
It's so hot these days.

217
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,280
Crazy late-summer heatwaves.

218
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,750
Xuejiao will find it unbearable in here.

219
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:51,200
Xuejiao?

220
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,800
You're acting strange today.

221
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,920
I thought you didn't really like her.

222
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,040
I just hate fools.

223
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,960
But now, she doesn't look so foolish anymore.

224
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,870
So, we can actually be friends.

225
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,040
Right.

226
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,710
When is she coming back?

227
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,870
I want to ask her how she managed to remove that virus during class.

228
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,290
I've been trying all day, but it doesn't work.

229
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:17,320
Shu Lan,

230
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,590
don't be like that.

231
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,560
You're scaring me.

232
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,902
   

233
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,470
Old Lin, isn't B&amp;C Motors' office way too fancy?

234
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,400
Also, they were the ones who approached us for cooperation this time.

235
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,660
They're so sincere.

236
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,580
What's that face?

237
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,440
They're just up to no good.

238
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,040
Sorry, I'm late.

239
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,320
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Vice President Zheng.

240
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,510
- Hello. 
 - Vice President Zheng.

241
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,280
Here's Vice President Zheng's business card. 
    

242
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,850
Please have a seat.

243
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,220
Lin Zhihua.

244
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,510
I've heard so much about you.

245
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,630
Professor Tan's favorite student.

246
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,080
With the university's entrepreneurship support,

247
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,230
he led a student team to independently develop

248
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,200
C1 autonomous driving technology.

249
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,980
What an honor to see you today.

250
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,580
You flatter me.

251
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,560
Let me make it clear.

252
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,700
We will spare no effort in facilitating this cooperation.

253
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,750
Come on.

254
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,870
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

255
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,260
Here's the contract drafted by our legal department. Please take a look.

256
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,350
My goodness. They're showing so much sincerity.

257
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,930
Vice President Zheng.

258
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,680
Why is the investment ratio so low in this contract?

259
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,160
Right now, we are working with more than 30 universities around the world.

260
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,220
And we are investing the most in you.

261
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,920
But this level of funding is completely insufficient to build a test track.

262
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,810
That's why we'd like both of you to work in Germany.

263
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,300
In Germany?

264
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,080
Germany. That's a nice place.

265
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,870
Well...

266
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,200
They're trying to get something for nothing.

267
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,700
What a fraud.

268
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,940
Germany is great.

269
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,830
Do they have no shame?

270
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,350
They said they'd spare no effort to make it work.

271
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,510
But in the end, the effort is ours to make.

272
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,280
A large enterprise like B&amp;C Motors

273
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,440
wouldn't let us gain any advantage in the contract.

274
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,200
They'll squeeze every last drop of value from us before they're done.

275
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,980
Yes. Less investment, and more shares.

276
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,950
They only offered a shared test track, and it's in Germany.

277
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,560
And they will only help the two of us with visas.

278
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
How is this enterprise-university collaboration?

279
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,035
They're just exporting the labor force overseas.

280
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:09,350
No way. We can't sign the contract.

281
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,800
If I have to, I'll look around and see what others offer.

282
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,080
- I'm not going to... 
 - It has to be them.

283
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,470
Come on. We should turn them down right now!

284
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,040
Since they can exploit us, we can also exploit them.

285
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,200
Wait. You really think we can outsmart them?

286
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,470
Forget it.

287
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,280
You'll see what I mean.

288
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,870
Where are you going?

289
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,920
Back to the lab.

290
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,320
Someone is waiting for me.

291
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,710
The equipment there is under maintenance.

292
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,160
Who's waiting for you?

293
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,460
   

294
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,510
   

295
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,420
Junlian may not be a big company,

296
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,800
but we've been doing investments for years.

297
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,280
People in the industry say I have good insight.

298
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,510
I'm willing to run around for any profitable project,

299
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,590
be it big or small.

300
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,610
So, people in the industry gave me a nickname—

301
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,946
Zhao Qiansun.

302
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:07,550
I know that.

303
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,250
Yes.

304
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:14,018
I don't know technology,

305
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:16,990
but the moment I heard that B&amp;C Motors wanted to work with you,

306
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,020
I knew I had to invest in you.

307
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,680
Look at you.

308
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,010
Manager Zhao, you're truly insightful.

309
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,200
Right.

310
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,420
What is B&amp;C Motors offering you in the contract?

311
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,990
Actually, none of the terms matter that much.

312
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,440
What matters is that they have the best technical team.

313
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,160
But you're from Jinghai University.

314
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,440
Isn't your team already top-notch?

315
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,310
But we must always compare with the market.

316
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,870
No team or technology can remain top-notch forever.

317
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,090
Well said.

318
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,960
I bought you a car, but you sold it in two days.

319
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,320
Do you really think it's so easy for me to make money?

320
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,440
That car is of no use to me.

321
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,780
And I get parking tickets all the time.

322
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,510
It's easier to get a taxi.

323
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,030
Do you think I bought you that car to make things easy for you?

324
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,040
It's to...

325
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,310
Anyway, other kids go out for fun on the weekends.

326
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,680
But you asked me to pick you up to go home.

327
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,750
What's wrong with you?

328
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,120
I am having fun with my friend.

329
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,960
Qi Lei went to college in another city.

330
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,440
We can't go out to have fun.

331
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,400
So we're hanging out online.

332
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,470
Do you have to hang out with guys?

333
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,920
Can't you hang out with some girls?

334
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,290
For example, Gu Xuejiao.

335
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,400
Xuejiao never asks to hang out with me.

336
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,780
Why can't you ask her to hang out?

337
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,360
I bought you that car so that you could take the girls out for a drive.

338
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,600
Son.

339
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,470
I know you're not so good at studying.

340
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,790
But do I really have to teach you everything in life?

341
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,960
But Xuejiiao doesn't buy it.

342
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,750
She doesn't like going for rides.

343
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,360
Then what does she like? Look into it.

344
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,960
I figured it out long ago.

345
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,070
She only likes to read and study.

346
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,510
She spends all day in that stupid lab.

347
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,680
She is different from your mom.

348
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,750
Your mom loves going for drives.

349
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,120
She loves shopping and wasting money.

350
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,100
Extravagantly.

351
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,790
You're saying my mom's shallow, right?

352
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,180
That's what you said. I didn't say that.

353
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,230
Anyway, Xuejiao is different.

354
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,920
Of course.

355
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,050
Otherwise, you wouldn't like her so much.

356
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,390
I'm tired of this.

357
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,800
Are you studying for the CET-4 and CET-6 exams?

358
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,840
Why are we talking about studying again?

359
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm only a freshman. I'll take the tests before my senior year, okay?

360
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,750
You really don't get it, kid.

361
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,520
I was way smarter when I was your age.

362
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,120
What did you do back then?

363
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,440
You can take the tests in your senior year,

364
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,000
but the person who can help you prepare for the tests can't wait that long.

365
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,510
That's right.

366
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,160
"That's right."

367
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,640
I've been planning everything for you.

368
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,350
Dad, you're an expert.

369
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,510
Stop the car. I think there's a bookstore nearby.

370
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,800
I'll go and get the study materials now.

371
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,380
Slow down.

372
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,710
Hello, Xuejiao? Do you have a minute?

373
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,350
Help me.

374
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,620
I've already done my best to make you a handsome kid.

375
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,190
It's up to you to improve the intelligence of the next generation, son.

376
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,530
You're already studying for the CET-4 and CET-6 exams?

377
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,040
I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

378
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,540
A cup of cappuccino, please.

379
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,690
My colleague will make it for you.

380
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,400
I want the one in your hand.

381
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,180
This one is not for sale.

382
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,140
Why are you here?

383
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,270
How does it taste?

384
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,710
The little fox is so cute.

385
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,980
I can't bear to drink it.

386
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,250
The little fox is quite cute.

387
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,230
I went to the lab early this morning, and you weren't there.

388
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,780
I asked Gao Rui, and he said you were here.

389
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,360
Didn't you quit the part-time job long ago?

390
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,880
Are you doing voluntary work?

391
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,780
Doing part-time jobs in the past made me realize

392
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,540
that brainless work helps me think clearly.

393
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,210
Are you thinking about B&amp;C Motors?

394
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,600
Everyone in the lab knows.

395
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,180
It's good news that an industry leader like B&amp;C wants to work with you.

396
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,270
The line between an industry leader and an industry bully

397
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,250
is a thin one.

398
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,510
Acquiring elite skills solely to serve the powerful.

399
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,840
I know you tend to look for optimal solutions.

400
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,380
B&amp;C Motors is the optimal solution at the present stage.

401
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,790
But who's willing to go and work as a slave for a company?

402
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,200
It's not just that.

403
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
I simply...

404
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,920
 hate to fall twice in the same place. 

405
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,030
It's the era of a free economy,

406
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,510
but the industry is monopolized.

407
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,840
B&amp;C Motors has not only reached the top in technology and R&amp;D,

408
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,510
but they're also trying to monopolize talent.

409
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,130
It may help them minimize their marginal costs to the extreme,

410
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,400
but it reduces top talents like you to mere screws in the machine.

411
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,360
Your marginal benefits will be minimized to the extreme.

412
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,270
And in the end, they can also kick you out

413
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,960
and take possession of all the work.

414
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,100
How do you know all this?

415
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,340
I...

416
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,692
I...

417
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:03,230
Well, they write about it in the official economics accounts all day long.

418
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,210
Did I say something wrong?

419
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,770
Not at all.

420
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,860
So what's your plan now?

421
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,590
An enterprise that monopolizes the market and talents

422
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,230
must get a taste of its own medicine.

423
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,830
Yes.

424
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,200
Hold on.

425
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,270
Here you go.

426
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,440
Thank you.

427
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,920
You're also from Jinghai University, right?

428
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
Yes.

429
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,400
That's why you look familiar.

430
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,990
What do you study? I'm a sophomore in Physics and Electronics.

431
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,962
I'm...

432
00:24:47,962 --> 00:24:49,230
Physics and Electronics?

433
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,710
It's right next door to us.

434
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,790
I'm from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences.

435
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,920
Interdisciplinary Information Sciences?

436
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,990
This is destiny.

437
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,600
Add me on WeChat.

438
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,960
Feel free to ask me any questions.

439
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,992
I...

440
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:01,780
I'll add you.

441
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,490
Sure.

442
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,200
You can just ask me.

443
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,580
You too.

444
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,440
Is he your boyfriend?

445
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,192
He...

446
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,080
It's none of your business.

447
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,030
What's wrong?

448
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,400
We're all from the same school.

449
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,000
Why are you so hostile?

450
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,020
As the saying goes,

451
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,820
"Be on guard against fire, theft, and seniors."

452
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,960
Totally, Senior.

453
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,580
Totally, little fox.

454
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,390
Hello?

455
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,070
I'll be right there.

456
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,960
I'll ask someone to take you to the reception room.

457
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,720
His last name is Gao.

458
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,100
The most dumb-looking one in the lab.

459
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,340
- Would you like to— 
 - I have to go.

460
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,400
- I'm meeting— 
 - Don't tell me

461
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,040
you're meeting a girl.

462
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,680
Why not?

463
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,340
See you.

464
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,070
Don't drink coffee when you have a cold.

465
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,210
 Her face... Isn't she the goddess from my dream? 

466
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,920
 Goddess. 

467
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,400
 Goddess. 

468
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,350
 Is this what they call a dream coming true? 

469
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,920
- Senior Brother. 
 - Senior Brother.

470
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,160
Be careful with these.

471
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,100
- Don't drop them. 
 - Okay.

472
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,030
I need them for my reports to the higher-ups.

473
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,520
Go ahead.

474
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,750
- These crappy machines... 
  - I... I must seize the chance 

475
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,200
 to attract her attention. 

476
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,990
No idea. Maybe he wants to sell them for money.

477
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,990
Our senior brother really cares about the university.

478
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,920
Hello?

479
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,310
What?

480
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,790
Principal Li really values my thesis?

481
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,390
And Principal Liu wants to see me?

482
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,960
Xiao Lin, I have to criticize you.

483
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,210
Scientific researchers must focus on our studies.

484
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,110
How can you take on so many social activities?

485
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,812
I'm not mad at you. I'm just telling you.

486
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:11,652
As an assistant, you must learn to share my burden

487
00:28:11,652 --> 00:28:13,750
so that I can focus on my research.

488
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,210
All right, that's it. We'll talk later.

489
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,010
Young people nowadays make me worried.

490
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,290
Are you waiting for someone?

491
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,750
The lab equipment is currently under maintenance.

492
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,120
Many people are on leave.

493
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,160
Who are you waiting for?

494
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,750
I'll look around for them.

495
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,790
There's no need.

496
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,010
I'll call him.

497
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,920
Hello?

498
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,790
Xiao Lin.

499
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:49,842
This is your cousin.

500
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,640
Hello?

501
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,460
Are you done with work?

502
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,400
You didn't forget that you agreed to help me, right?

503
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,770
I...

504
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,400
Of course I remember.

505
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,110
So when should we meet?

506
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,400
Today.

507
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,840
See you at my university's cafeteria.

508
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,680
Okay. I'll be right there.

509
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,520
Bye.

510
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,400
Right, I went through the contract for B&amp;C Motors.

511
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,486
The terms are a bit harsh indeed.

512
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:44,008
Why didn't you come directly to Lin Qi?

513
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:45,898
I didn't want to.

514
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:50,747
You think our family business isn't as big as B&amp;C Motors, don't you?

515
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,310
If I take their money, I have to work for them.

516
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,720
I don't want to commit fraud for them.

517
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,510
Isn't it enough that you're taking care of those two?

518
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,650
Leave me out of it.

519
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,940
You'd better not hand any proposals to Lin Qi in the future.

520
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,550
Also, B&amp;C Motors sent me a new contract with much better terms.

521
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,710
But the investment hasn't reached my expectations.

522
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,580
They gave in?

523
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,600
This doesn't seem like their style.

524
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,680
They usually won't budge no matter what.

525
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,550
They're absolutely arrogant.

526
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,820
It was because I spread the news that Junlian is also approaching us.

527
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,360
Way to go, cousin.

528
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,270
You've even played B&amp;C Motors.

529
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,910
Congratulations.

530
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,680
But I have another idea now.

531
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,360
I... I need to take this.

532
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,440
- Save me a spot. 
 - Okay.

533
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,000
Hello?

534
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,250
A-Aren't you meeting someone?

535
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,920
Yes, I am.

536
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,750
Xuejiao.

537
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,690
There you are.

538
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,530
Why do I keep running into you?

539
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,352
- Well... 
 - Well...

540
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:17,210
- Let's eat together. 
 - Let's eat together.

541
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,740
Xuejiao, try this. It's amazing.

542
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,990
That's enough.

543
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,920
Have it yourself.

544
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,490
Isn't it good?

545
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,400
It's so spicy. I can't breathe.

546
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Really? Have this then.

547
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,470
Spicy stir-fried carrots.

548
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,610
It helps you breathe. Come on.

549
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,030
No thanks. Thanks.

550
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,550
Eat it yourself.

551
00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:00,250
Mr. Ex-boyfriend, you're really a living curse in my life.

552
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,250
Thanks.

553
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,510
Senior Brother Lin,

554
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,580
are you waiting for your girlfriend?

555
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,270
You're so sweet.

556
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,840
He got the food, set the chopsticks,

557
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,150
and even brought her water.

558
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,200
I have to learn from you.

559
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,070
Our Xiao Lin is indeed very sweet. Even to his cousin.

560
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,840
He'll be even sweeter to his girlfriend in the future.

561
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,160
Isn't that right?

562
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,940
Sister Yue, Senior Brother Lin was meeting with you?

563
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,100
Cousin?

564
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,740
Are you sure she's not your girlfriend?

565
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,340
Let me introduce myself.

566
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,270
I'm Lin Zhihua's cousin, Lin Zhiyue.

567
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:58,450
Are you... Xuejiao's boyfriend?

568
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,410
- No. 
 - No.

569
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,310
Just not yet.

570
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,450
 But I will be one day. 

571
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,740
Dig in. The food's getting cold.

572
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,010
- Dig in. 
 - Avoid spicy food when you have a cold.

573
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,420
You have a cold?

574
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,820
Come here—

575
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,500
Do I have to stuff tissue into your nose for you to understand?

576
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,550
Should I get you some medicine?

577
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,510
I'll get some different food for you.

578
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,500
There's no need.

579
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,440
Are you sure?

580
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,350
Really?

581
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm glad you're learning.

582
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,960
He's trying hard.

583
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,920
- There's no need. 
 - You'll spill it.

584
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,470
- It's pointless, no matter what. 
 - True.

585
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,250
The opponent is too simple-minded for you to take extreme measures.

586
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,530
Opponent?

587
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,110
Senior Brother Lin. Sister Yue.

588
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,030
I'm going to go help Yi Tianyu with his English.

589
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,960
- See you next time. 
 - Bye.

590
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,030
Bye-bye.

591
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,840
Give me your bag.

592
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,450
Let's go.

593
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,410
Cousin, you can deceive others, but not me.

594
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,130
Good luck.

595
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,600
Old Lin.

596
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,620
Did you meet your cousin?

597
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,530
My cousin?

598
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,550
You've met Lin Zhiyue?

599
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,800
- Tell me about her. 
 - Then why didn't you come and eat with us?

600
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,360
Eat?

601
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,800
You had dinner already?

602
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,110
I-I was thinking about buying you both dinner.

603
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,450
Why are you overly attentive for no reason?

604
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,020
Spit it out, or I'm leaving.

605
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:28,510
Come on. I just... Does your cousin have a boyfriend?

606
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,070
No.

607
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,780
Why do you ask?

608
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,030
Isn't she looking forward to a relationship?

609
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,550
Not really.

610
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,530
The word "man" doesn't exist in her dictionary.

611
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,252
- I'm off. 
 - What...

612
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:44,590
What kind of dictionary is that?

613
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,620
She should get it reprinted.

614
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,500
   

615
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,320
   

616
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,240
I wasn't able to show you around due to the maintenance over the past few days.

617
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,990
Professor Tan and Grandmaster told me to show you around today.

618
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,470
Meet Zhao Zhao, Zhiqiang, and Wenbo.

619
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,030
Meet Xuejiao. She's new.

620
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,639
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Senior Brothers.

621
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,510
Our lab consists mainly of two parts.

622
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,152
One part is the research group I am in charge of

623
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:16,840
that develops collision-avoidance modules for our C1 autonomous system.

624
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,110
We're mainly working in the lab right now.

625
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,550
The other part is the enterprise-university joint C1 Project Team that Grandmaster is in charge of.

626
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,850
He's mainly working on the test track.

627
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,640
But unfortunately, he won't come here anymore.

628
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:34,493
Why not?

629
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,863
Haven't you heard?

630
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,528
It seems like you're not that close with him.

631
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:41,013
He's going to Germany.

632
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:45,530
He’s taking C1 for physical vehicle simulation at B&amp;C Motors’ headquarters.

633
00:36:50,115 --> 00:36:52,280
What are you thinking about? Let's go.

634
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,610
Hurry up.

635
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,590
Right, I forgot to tell you.

636
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,052
We're also helping with the anniversary events

637
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:08,280
by running the AI voice bots on our lab servers.

638
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,470
You can take a look.

639
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,840
We're very versatile.

640
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,820
This is our lab's newly upgraded, latest-generation processor.

641
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,190
It's paired with high-speed DDR4 memory.

642
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,140
From now on, you'll be in charge of it.

643
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,240
Thank you, Senior Brother.

644
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,360
I will be careful when I operate it.

645
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,470
Make sure you clean the dust collected in there.

646
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,320
Keep it clean inside and out.

647
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,880
Be very careful when you wipe it.

648
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,340
Do not damage the parts, signs,

649
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,400
or these parameter stickers while cleaning.

650
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,840
After that, mop the entire floor.

651
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,170
I'll come and check in an hour.

652
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,240
Me?

653
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,110
Clean up?

654
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,630
Come in.

655
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,220
- Professor Tan. 
 - Xiao Lin.

656
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,720
I sent B&amp;C Motors' new contract to your email.

657
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,050
The main terms remain the same.

658
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,050
But the detailed terms are a little better.

659
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,700
I looked at the contract.

660
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,990
B&amp;C Motors didn't really make a good offer.

661
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,520
Have you made up your mind?

662
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:17,390
All right. Sure.

663
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:22,230
Since you've made up your mind, I trust your judgment.

664
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,590
But isn't it too sudden?

665
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,150
Don't you need to talk to your family and friends before leaving?

666
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,480
I believe many people can't bear to part with you.

667
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,720
That's enough.

668
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,030
Go ahead. I'll take a break.

669
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,590
What's wrong with you lately?

670
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,150
Why are you learning English?

671
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,510
- So hardworking. 
 - Exactly.

672
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,590
What do you know?

673
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,280
I love studying.

674
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,970
I'm making sacrifices for love.

675
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,800
Oh no.

676
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,580
I forgot to do my homework.

677
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,050
Oh no. I forgot.

678
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,190
Yi Tianyu, are you serious?

679
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,990
Who does homework in college?

680
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,449
Go away. Don't stop me from pursuing love.

681
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:33,509
We'll continue our practice then.

682
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,550
Wait.

683
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,560
What is Xuejiao going to teach me

684
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,200
if I get everything right?

685
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,150
   

686
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,490
Let me get half of it right, and half of it wrong.

687
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,880
This way, I don't look so ignorant,

688
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,190
and Xuejiao will feel fulfilled about helping me.

689
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,560
How can I be so smart?

690
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,340
Sure enough. If there's a will, there's a way.

691
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,710
Xuejiao, just wait for me.

692
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,360
"I must take up the mantle and discipline you strictly."

693
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,740
Gross.

694
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,040
What are you dressed as?

695
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,060
I'm a cleaning lady.

696
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,670
You look like one.

697
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,590
The prestigious Autonomous Driving Lab of Jinghai University

698
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,510
can't even afford a cleaning lady?

699
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,320
This is a lab tradition.

700
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,050
We have a tight budget, so we resort to free labor.

701
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,320
You're actually a bit more honest than Lin Jiadong.

702
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,570
He was trying to gaslight me.

703
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,050
Forget it. Complaining to you is pointless.

704
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,720
Anyway, you're going to Germany.

705
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,880
You were full of vitality when you first came to the lab.

706
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,030
How did you become so whiny?

707
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,990
I also had to clean up when I first joined.

708
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,070
It's not just because of that.

709
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,240
Then what's the problem?

710
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,340
Are... Are you really going to Germany?

711
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,210
- Does that bother you? 
 - Of course.

712
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:33,118
Once you're gone, no one will back me up.

713
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,270
That's the reason?

714
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,140
I'm new here.

715
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,840
If I don't have a reliable supporter, I feel insecure.

716
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,060
Then give me a reason to stay.

717
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,880
If...

718
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,279
If you leave,

719
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:59,760
Professor Tan will lose a talented student.

720
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,290
I feel sorry for him.

721
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,792
Here's the restroom.

722
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:59,980
