1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to tell the truth

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The city is shaking

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is lighting up the way for me to go

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Shining and smiling eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My dream is to go to the capital

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I, Gu Xuejiao, have a dream of becoming a student since I was a child

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For this, I work very hard every day

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Who knows that the harder I work, the more I run away

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The more I run away, the more I am disappointed

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A black-skinned athlete will become a stingy man one day

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What can the work be compared to the work of a man?

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Fortunately, work is not only about the study

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It also depends on the ability

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You are in charge of the technical department of the software platform

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
From administrative department to core technology department

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I envy you

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Other hard-working graduates are software engineers

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I have been away for five years

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
September 5, 2024

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My 28th birthday

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Gu Xuejiao, your new life is about to begin

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, no signing

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes, maybe my first degree is not within the scope of use

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But I still want to take this opportunity

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I used my time in the field to study at Han Shou University

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I got a certificate of academic qualification for software engineering

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Look, I really cherish this opportunity

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In order to transfer to the technical department

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I even gave up the transfer opportunity of the original position

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You didn't pass our department test

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have an email, I passed it

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There is a very famous bug in the program you wrote

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Can you show me the wrong date?

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you think I'm wrong?

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Miss Gu, I definitely don't want to lose my talent

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So we will apply for you again

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Headcounts transferred to your original position

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your network performance is indeed very good

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But your resume is indeed not compatible with our technical department

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No need, I quit

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Anyway, I have technology

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't starve to death anywhere

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't starve to death anywhere

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Impulsive

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I should have known that I would die after talking about my resignation

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Congratulations to transfer

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I broke up half a year ago

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Xu Qiang

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's make up, okay?

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have already asked you for two games

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You are so great

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't be angry, everyone sees you

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You were not like this before

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You used to take me to the same school

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You also changed your support

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Later, in order not to fall in love with me

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I gave up the opportunity to send my parents twice

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You forgot

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This relationship has always been me

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have been paying for it in one way

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
In order for us to be together

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I gave up so much

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And you

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But you didn't say that before

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You used to say that I was handsome and cool

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Even if you are a male lead in TV series

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will always be a female lead

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So I have to scold myself

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You are so great

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I will die if I talk about it again

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We are almost thirty years old

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You are always eighteen years old in my mind

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Xu Qiang

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sir

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Didn't you say that we should be separated forever?

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
GM Lin, thank you

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You even sent me down

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You are GM Lin's most important talent

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now the company is officially ready to make up

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In order to give you a good reputation

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have already sent the company's foreign packages

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We bought a fatal version in his program

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
GM Lin means this

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Of course

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I transferred Gu Xu Jiao's program to the company

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want to review

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Lin Zhihua

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Did I offend you?

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why are you so annoying me?

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I didn't record you to tease you

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can you find your own problem first?

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
For a man, I don't want anything

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Give up the chance to make a living

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have been a very strong foreign package for five years

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have been a third-rate person

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I gave up the transfer quota when I failed to transfer

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It means you can't distinguish the main ones

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You are not good at anti-pressure

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You will be a burden if you enter the technical department

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why do you change my program?

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I change your program

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You put a bug in my program

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Just to make you feel like you are in the middle of the crisis

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Isn't it?

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If it's not fair, I don't admit it

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You don't let me go to the building to get the computer

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How to get your program out and check it out

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Then I will go with you

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I will keep an eye on you

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I will wait for you

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What happened?

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't panic! I'm not going to die

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm in love

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If I were to be a drug dealer, I would have died earlier

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I just want to go back to ten years ago

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will kill myself

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
After all, it's impossible to be with him

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
For a man, I don't want anything

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,280
and give up the chance to make a living.

132
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,800
For five years,

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,640
he's still a very reliable outsider.

134
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,000
The more you love, the more you'll be happy.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
Didn't you say we'll be separated forever?

136
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,200
If it weren't for the death of Yi Tian Yu,

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,080
the one who's in the top five

138
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,600
might be him, not me.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
There's still half an hour left to hand in the paper.

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Don't mess up.

141
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Wait.

142
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,200
Jing Hai Middle School.

143
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,360
2014.

144
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Grade three?

145
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Oh my.

146
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
What are you doing?

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
What am I doing?

148
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm just messing around.

149
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,680
Why are you acting like a senior?

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Let's go.

151
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
In order to take me to the same school as you,

152
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,600
you even changed your school name.

153
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Later, in order to not date me,

154
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,680
you didn't date me,

155
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,400
and you even gave up the chance to make a living.

156
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Did you forget?

157
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,920
In this relationship,

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm the one who's in charge of everything.

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Ye Xiao.

160
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,600
What are you doing?

161
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
You're taking the exam.

162
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I...

163
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
I... I'm going to pay.

164
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,600
I haven't finished writing this.

165
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
It's an exam for the progress.

166
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Eh...

167
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,480
Can you take the test?

168
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,160
Astronomical Bureau, Tian Qiao Street.

169
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,620
I have been dreaming ever since.

170
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,740
When I was at now 12th grade,

171
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,740
I was struggling with studying and dream work.

172
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,360
The composition of the enzymes is only getting worse.

173
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,000
But I realized once I publicize it in a famous close-up,

174
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,920
the hard-working and coses-to-��르에- erklären study'sぉ

175
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,700
will not help me to realise the quality of my major.

176
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,880
If you really don't want to play games,

177
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,160
and you really like playing softball,

178
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,520
you should know me well.

179
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,800
If now,

180
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I was so depressed that I fell into a lot of pain.

181
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Even in my dreams,

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
I want to poke my own mouth.

183
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
For a 30-year-old person,

184
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,680
it's a bit of a

185
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
relationship to return to the dream of youth.

186
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
I'd better wake up.

187
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
What are you doing?

188
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Yi Tianyu?

189
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Why are you still in your dream?

190
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
You're still here.

191
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
You're still a brother.

192
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
But this 18-year-old face

193
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
is too real.

194
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
You're here to do this again?

195
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Wait, wait, wait.

196
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
You brought me here

197
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
just to give me this shock.

198
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Wait, wait. It hurts me too.

199
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
It hurts me too.

200
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
It hurts me too.

201
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Isn't this a dream?

202
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Isn't this a dream?

203
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Isn't this a dream?

204
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Isn't this a dream?

205
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Isn't this a dream?

206
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Finally, let's take a look

207
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
at the weather in the fifth day of September.

208
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
The highest temperature in the daytime is 28 degrees Celsius.

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
The lowest temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.

210
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
The weather is hot.

211
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
The weather is hot.

212
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Let's go and have a look.

213
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
The socks are cold.

214
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Hurry up and have a look.

215
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
It's so hot.

216
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
It's so hot.

217
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
It's so hot.

218
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
It's so hot.

219
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
It's so hot.

220
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
It's so hot.

221
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I'm reborn.

222
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Don't you think it's a surprise?

223
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Who wants to see you?

224
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
You gave me the C note.

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
No wonder you gave me the C note.

228
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
You wanted to ask me out.

229
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
It's really my fault.

231
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
I can't make it clear now.

232
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Mr. Ding.

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Where?

234
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Where?

235
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Really?

236
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
I'll give you a lesson today.

237
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,160
In the future, don't just look at the front.

238
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm leaving.

239
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Study hard.

240
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
2014.

241
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Grade three.

242
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm eighteen.

243
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
I've been stupid for 18 years.

244
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Gu Xuejiao.

245
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Don't say God didn't give you a chance.

246
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Let's start over.

247
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Let's test the skills first.

248
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Can you know the number of the important number in advance?

249
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Is it reliable?

250
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Don't worry.

251
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
I'll definitely let you win.

252
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
The number of the red ball is

253
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
No. 31 and No. 24.

254
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I don't remember the important number at all.

255
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
The double color ball doesn't work.

256
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Change another one.

257
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Boss.

258
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Actually, I just said it wrong.

259
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
I want to talk about the theme.

260
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
It's the super big explosion.

261
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
The game of the world record.

262
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
The world cup is Germany against Brazil.

263
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
You buy seven to one.

264
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I'll revenge for you.

265
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I can't.

266
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Why?

267
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
The world cup is over.

268
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Where do you want me to buy it?

269
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
September 5, 2014.

270
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Yes.

271
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Today is the final test.

272
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Summer is over.

273
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
By the way.

274
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Today is my 18th birthday.

275
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Birthday.

276
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
Birthday.

277
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Boss.

278
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
But I ran away with the ticket price.

279
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Don't let people misunderstand me for doing business.

280
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
According to what I know.

281
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
The well-known mobile phone brand Yano

282
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Today officially announced bankruptcy.

283
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I am the original factory in Shennan.

284
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,160
As one of the largest original suppliers of Yano.

285
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
In the face of a big bankruptcy.

286
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
A large number of products are out of stock.

287
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
According to the relevant information.

288
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
The original factory is currently out of funding.

289
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
The salary of the employees has been suspended.

290
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
The employees are looking for a factory.

291
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Next, I will report to you the financial information.

292
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
On my 18th birthday.

293
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Lao Gu left the stock.

294
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Between the salary of the general and the salary of the general.

295
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I chose to live with the factory.

296
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
But in the end, there was no compensation.

297
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
He lost his job.

298
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
This has become an unfulfilled old stock.

299
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
The future ten years.

300
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
The source of the whole journey.

301
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I not only want to change my fate.

302
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
But also let the people I care about.

303
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Live a better life.

304
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
This time.

305
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
I can't say anything.

306
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Let Lao Gu sign on the will.

307
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Dad, I'm back.

308
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
You're back.

309
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Dad.

310
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Why did you sign?

311
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
This original factory is about to fall.

312
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Forget it.

313
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
He won't believe it even if I say it.

314
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
I said.

315
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Why don't we think about it again?

316
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
What era are we in now?

317
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Everyone uses intelligent machines.

318
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Who else has a secret?

319
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
What's wrong with this kid?

320
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
A while ago.

321
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Steadily support me.

322
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
I'm not a kid anymore.

323
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm not a kid anymore.

324
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
A while ago.

325
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Steadily support me.

326
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
To live with the factory.

327
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Why now?

328
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Change your mind?

329
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Look at your phone.

330
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
The day of the birthday.

331
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Factory's forest village competition.

332
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
I won it for you.

333
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
This is eight years.

334
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
There is no problem at all.

335
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
You say.

336
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
What does this mean?

337
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
This proves.

338
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Some things.

339
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Can experience the test of time.

340
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
People are the same.

341
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
By the way.

342
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
There is another good thing.

343
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
I'll show you.

344
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I'll take it for you.

345
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Look.

346
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Uncle Sun in the canteen.

347
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I heard that your birthday.

348
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I made you such a big cake.

349
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Wait for your mother and your brother.

350
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Let's cut it.

351
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Okay.

352
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
You take a break.

353
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I'll go and cook some dishes.

354
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
This time.

355
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I can't let my old aunt repeat the same mistake.

356
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Who are you standing here?

357
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Don't think I don't know.

358
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
What do you want to do?

359
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I want to go out for a while.

360
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Don't tell my mother.

361
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I let you out.

362
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm with you.

363
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
That time.

364
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Your brother and I are in the same team.

365
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
You can't be absent.

366
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
You are a blood-sucking intern.

367
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
You are a bad guy.

368
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Get out.

369
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
I'm not.

370
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
I'm not.

371
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I'm not.

372
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm not.

373
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm not.

374
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm not.

375
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm not.

376
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm not.

377
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm not.

378
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
What's going on?

379
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Did I hit you?

380
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
You hit me.

381
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Are you okay?

382
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
This bad guy doesn't close the window.

383
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Look.

384
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
It must be the wind blowing.

385
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
This thing is broken.

386
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
You thought you were a thief.

387
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Actually I'm unlucky.

388
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
You are right.

389
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I...

390
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
How dare you?

391
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
I...

392
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,160
I know you still have your brother in your heart.

393
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
You didn't forget to cover me up.

394
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
I brought you breakfast.

395
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Let's go.

396
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Give me the key.

397
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
I'm in a hurry.

398
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
What are you doing?

399
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Give me the key.

400
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm watching you here today.

401
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Where are you going?

402
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
I'm here.

403
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm here.

404
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Give me a skill.

405
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
I broke up.

406
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I didn't pay my rent.

407
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
I was just kicked out by the landlord.

408
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
How about this?

409
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
You can stay in my room for a few days.

410
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Guo Mingze.

411
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
This time,

412
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
I'll take the key to your secret.

413
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Where is the key?

414
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
I'm here.

415
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I'm here.

416
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
I'm here.

417
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I'm here.

418
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I'm here.

419
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Gu Mingze.

420
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Xinxiao.

421
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Why are you sleeping here?

422
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Dad.

423
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Brother...

424
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
It's the weekend.

425
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,160
He doesn't need to buy us breakfast.

426
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Who says he doesn't need to go to class?

427
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
He's a teacher.

428
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
He'll be his tutor later.

429
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
He was right the other day.

430
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I've made a deal with your mom.

431
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
This is the teacher.

432
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I'm not eating.

433
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
You have a family dinner today.

434
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I have to go to work.

435
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
By the way, Xuejiao.

436
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
From today on,

437
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
you should follow the class.

438
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
And you must watch your brother.

439
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Let him have a good class.

440
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,160
This teacher is a top student of Jinghai University.

441
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Last year,

442
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
he was a senior in high school.

443
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
He got a 200 points increase.

444
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Let's ask him to do something.

445
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
I'll pay for two college entrance exams.

446
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm leaving.

447
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Bye, mom.

448
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Bye.

449
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Take good care of your class.

450
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I remember you wanted to go to Jingdao when you were a kid.

451
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Jingdao.

452
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,160
My dream is to go to Jingdao.

453
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Gu Xuejiao.

454
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
You used to be so ambitious.

455
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
How did you get yourself so far?

456
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
You've read your own book.

457
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
You deserve it.

458
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
You used the camera of Han Shou

459
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
in high school.

460
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
You're already at the peak of your life.

461
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
In the world of school,

462
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
there's no end to life.

463
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
In the world of college,

464
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
there's no end to life.

465
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
There's no end to life.

466
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
No effect.

467
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
A vast channel.

468
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
No effect.

469
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
An unsettled heartbeat.

470
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
I don't want people to be a shadow to others.

471
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
No effect.

472
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
A compassionate hug.

473
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
No effect.

474
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
A lonely fight.

475
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
No effect.

476
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
A lazy anger.

477
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Life is not a secret.

478
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Let's expose it.

479
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
The new star, Wen Qu,

480
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm a winner in the end.

481
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm a winner in the end.

482
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Why can't I remember the exam questions?

483
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,280
I still remember the questions.

484
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,080
I don't remember the dance moves.

485
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
I don't remember the exam questions either.

486
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,760
It seems that I can't be a loser in the beginning.

487
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,320
Fine.

488
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,120
I'll do the mock exam first.

489
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,160
I don't know the answer.

490
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
I don't know the answer either.

491
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,840
Gu Mingze.

492
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,480
You know to come back?

493
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Ling Zhihua.

494
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Why are you torturing me like this?

495
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,080
I've never offended you.

496
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,920
You don't want me to go to Fuyi Restaurant to get the computer.

497
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,600
How can I find out your program?

498
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Is it Gu's?

499
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,320
This is too hard to say.

500
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,120
What did you say?

501
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,040
I mean,

502
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,720
why doesn't Gao come here himself?

503
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,080
He wants to find someone to treat him.

504
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,040
He has something to do temporarily.

505
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,760
I'll take over his part-time job.

506
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Let's not talk about him.

507
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,040
Let's talk about you.

508
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,960
You're the idiot

509
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,240
who failed in the two continuous exams

510
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,320
that Gao Rui said.

511
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,760
At that moment,

512
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,120
I lost in two continuous exams.

513
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,320
You asked for it.

514
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
You haven't got any shame.

515
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,840
I bet you're so максимist in words.

516
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,360
I'm not as good as you are.

517
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,280
Tutoring books are a state's best.

518
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm a live streamer.

519
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,040
I haven't graduated yet.

520
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
You don't have a degree, right?

521
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,520
You can say that.

522
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,280
Then don't blame me for complaining

523
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,800
and taking revenge.

524
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,960
Although it's free,

525
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,880
but if Senior Gao

526
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,280
comes to me for fun,

527
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,760
isn't it a little bit uncomfortable?

528
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm leaving.

529
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,000
Wait.

530
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,160
You give up like this?

531
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Do you want to try again

532
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,560
to win me over?

533
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,360
How about I kneel down

534
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,480
and cry and beg you

535
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,160
to give me a chance?

536
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,680
It's not impossible.

537
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,720
Senior Gao failed in his speech.

538
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,160
It's not good to say it out loud.

539
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,880
Right?

540
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm sorry.

541
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm sorry.

542
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm sorry.

543
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm sorry.

544
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Thanks.

545
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,280
He left

546
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,880
without saying goodbye.

547
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,480
He�� patriotic as a child.

548
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,960
Should I go back to the hotel with Guan Mingoki?

549
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,480
Jiaojiao?

550
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Jiaojiao?

551
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,600
I can't

552
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I can't bear to leave you.

553
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,720
I can't bear to leave you.

554
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,200
Why can't I bear to leave you?

555
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
Don't worry, Shiyu.

556
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,440
I'll be back to Class One soon.

557
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,680
No one is more important than a sister.

558
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,480
Am I right?

559
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,480
Zao.

560
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,640
What's wrong?

561
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,440
You...

562
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,080
You'll fall twice in the same pit.

563
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,360
I mean,

564
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,640
I'll only learn about the world from now on.

565
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,280
So you really don't want to stay in Class Eight?

566
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,680
No.

567
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,560
No way.

568
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,880
You've worked so hard.

569
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,200
It's a pity that you can't go to Class Eight.

570
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,160
You're leaving so soon.

571
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,240
Don't you feel sorry?

572
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,080
So don't give up on Xue Jiao.

573
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,560
I'll play the role of a thug for you later.

574
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,240
Sun Tiantian.

575
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,480
Who are you?

576
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,720
I'm Gu Xue Jiao.

577
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,800
My dad is the same.

578
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,560
I remember.

579
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,640
I was the one who baked the cake

580
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,120
for my dad on your birthday.

581
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,920
My dad told me that you were in Class Eight.

582
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,240
I'm here now too.

583
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,920
We can go to school together.

584
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,680
Okay.

585
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,160
Move aside.

586
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,600
Don't look at me.

587
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,560
You can't do that, Shiyu.

588
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm here.

589
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,200
Come here.

590
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,240
Shiyu, are you okay?

591
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,160
I'm fine.

592
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,240
Shiyu, run.

593
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,520
Shiyu, run.

594
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,800
Don't be caught by him.

595
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I've been practicing again.

596
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,680
I'm afraid of him.

597
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,840
Sit down.

598
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,360
You're not Xue Jiao.

599
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,400
Wait.

600
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,920
I'll hear you scold me every day.

601
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
You're done.

602
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,120
Classmate.

603
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,560
Are you okay?

604
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,520
Get up.

605
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,480
Class,

606
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,000
this semester,

607
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,440
in order to make you

608
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,880
have a fresh learning face,

609
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,520
the teacher decided to

610
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,680
repeat the test

611
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,480
and rehearse again.

612
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
I hope this reward mechanism

613
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,600
can make you more active.

614
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,640
You're in the third grade.

615
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,880
We have to rush.

616
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,400
The students who read my name

617
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,440
will enter the classroom to choose a seat.

618
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,360
Liu Jiaxue.

619
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:28,920
Yes.

620
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,600
Xi Junyang.

621
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,680
Yes, teacher.

622
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Bai Yubing.

623
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,120
Yes.

624
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,640
Isn't this Gu Xuejiao?

625
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,480
Yes.

626
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,000
Xuejiao.

627
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,480
Lin Zi.

628
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:35,800
Yes.

629
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,480
Aren't you afraid of being scolded?

630
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,840
Yes.

631
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,720
Do you know that she's one of the parents?

632
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,800
Yes.

633
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,000
I know her so well.

634
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,440
Yes.

635
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,680
Wang Junsheng.

636
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,480
That girl.

637
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,360
Yes.

638
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,160
Zhang Yujia.

639
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,600
Yes.

640
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,400
The enemy of the enemy is a friend.

641
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,280
Zhou Zilin.

642
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,720
Yes.

643
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,800
She's so good at it

644
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,040
that she's here to test our class.

645
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,720
It's none of my business.

646
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,000
I didn't say it's none of your business.

647
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,960
Xi Lei.

648
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,640
Yes.

649
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,240
Let's go.

650
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,200
Sun Tiantian.

651
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,680
Yes.

652
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,360
Isn't she

653
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,720
a deskmate of Yi Tianyu?

654
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,040
Gu Xuejiao.

655
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,840
Teacher Yuan.

656
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,320
Did you shout it wrong?

657
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,520
I should be the one who entered the class.

658
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,280
That's right.

659
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,560
You're the next one.

660
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,520
She's higher than you.

661
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,040
Look.

662
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,560
I...

663
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,640
Yi Tianyu.

664
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,160
I...

665
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,040
This...

666
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,800
Isn't it here?

667
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,080
She's one point higher than you.

668
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,160
One point is also high.

669
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,840
Work hard next time.

670
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,600
Work hard next time.

671
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,120
Go.

672
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,680
Students.

673
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
She's just a decoration

674
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,400
if you don't think about it.

675
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
I don't ask you to

676
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,160
be better than other classmates.

677
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,880
But you don't have to be the last in the class,

678
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,480
right?

679
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Why is she

680
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
higher than the last time?

681
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,400
She's going around.

682
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,720
But she's the classmate of Yi Tianyu.

683
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,880
You...

684
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,040
I know you're looking at me.

685
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,480
You're making a scene.

686
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,640
I'm making a scene.

687
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,600
Yi Tianyu.

688
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,680
You don't study.

689
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,480
Don't delay those

690
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,080
who want to study, okay?

691
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,000
If you don't study,

692
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,320
you'll be embarrassed.

693
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,960
Come on.

694
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,520
Let's turn the paper

695
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,920
to page two.

696
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,360
What's this?

697
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,560
Tiantian.

698
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,040
Why are you crying?

699
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,080
You didn't memorize it?

700
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,160
You didn't memorize it?

701
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,560
No.

702
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:47,300
In the

703
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,560
Senior High School,

704
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,640
she became the top student

705
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,920
in the first year of senior high school.

706
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,120
She succeeded in the top student.

707
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,800
She even got a prize

708
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
and got into the top student's class.

709
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,080
There's such a good person in our school?

710
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,040
I finally got it.

711
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,000
I've been teaching her for three days

712
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,640
before the exam.

713
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,040
I got 80 points in math for the first time.

714
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,120
You're so bad.

715
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
You're so bad.

716
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,800
You've got a few options wrong.

717
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,160
What a bad student.

718
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,520
You're good. You got 18 points.

719
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,840
Let me see.

720
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,720
Remember to return it to me.

721
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,320
You're not as handsome as me.

722
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,920
Tiantian.

723
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,720
Do you want my photo?

724
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,400
I'll give you mine.

725
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,680
It's definitely better than hers.

726
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,800
I'll go find it for you later.

727
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,840
I think I have one.

728
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,280
Yi Tianyu.

729
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,480
Go on.

730
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,120
I'll go find it for you later.

731
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,040
You Xiuhuan.

732
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,760
What did you bring me today?

733
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,720
I asked you to charge the electric bottle yesterday.

734
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
Did you forget what you promised?

735
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,200
You didn't answer my call.

736
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,240
I pushed it back in the rain.

737
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,320
I just want to make this

738
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,920
I love the snow glue baby.

739
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,040
But I didn't hear it.

740
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,640
Yi Tianyu who went to her.

741
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,440
The student who went to her.

742
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
I'll go find it for you later.

743
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,320
I only believe in myself this time.

744
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,040
Who would have thought

745
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,480
that the capitalist who bullied me ten years later

746
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,080
is just a coffee shop worker.

747
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,080
As long as I can take out the camera

748
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,000
that serves the party at work,

749
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,520
I can definitely trick him back into being a tutor.

750
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,480
What are you doing?

751
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm a student of the devil.

752
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,320
I'm not good at it.

753
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,560
I'm just a weirdo.

754
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,480
I'll see what you're like.

755
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,400
Senior Lin.

756
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,160
I was the one who didn't know Taishan.

757
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,840
I really want to ask you to come out

758
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,720
and help me get to the school.

759
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,640
This is a coffee shop.

760
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,040
If you want coffee, the menu is up there.

761
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,920
Okay.

762
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,720
It's not over yet, right?

763
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,520
That's right.

764
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,520
I really sincerely want to invite you.

765
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,560
If you want to order, the door is over there.

766
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,640
Order.

767
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,800
Order.

768
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:11,880
I'll order.

769
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,440
I'll order a cup of cappuccino without sugar

770
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,760
for you.

771
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,880
How to pay?

772
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,120
Pay.

773
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm leaving.

774
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,760
Bye.

775
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,200
Bye.

776
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,760
Be careful.

777
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,200
Bye.

778
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,400
Senior Lin.

779
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,080
You waited all day?

780
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,320
How can I wait?

781
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,240
I'm doing my homework.

782
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,320
Senior Lin.

783
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
I've reflected on myself these two days.

784
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,760
When you came to my house to see me,

785
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,040
I was just about to pass the exam.

786
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,400
So I'm sorry to be angry with you.

787
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,840
I'm really sorry.

788
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,440
You can criticize me as you want.

789
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
I'm a fool.

790
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,480
I'm a bad person.

791
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,520
For the sake of my poor ability,

792
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,440
can you be my tutor?

793
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,080
First,

794
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,760
my student is Gu Mingze.

795
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,480
Not you.

796
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,000
Second,

797
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,920
I've talked to my student's parents.

798
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,280
When Gao Rui is free,

799
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,840
he will return to the position.

800
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,080
I'm me.

801
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
My brother is my brother.

802
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,720
I want you to be my tutor.

803
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,560
Excuse me.

804
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,160
Senior Lin.

805
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Senior Lin.

806
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,920
I won't leave if you don't agree.

807
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,600
Look over there.

808
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,480
Senior Lin.

809
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,160
Senior Lin.

810
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,920
Senior Lin.

811
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
You're waiting for me, right?

812
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,160
It's a disease to be too confident.

813
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,120
You have to cure it.

814
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,680
This is the safest toilet I've ever tested.

815
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,760
I didn't expect you

816
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
to be so careful.

817
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,440
In the limited life,

818
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,920
you can only be passionate.

819
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,320
Look,

820
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,920
our goals are the same.

821
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,160
You spent a year in senior high school

822
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,000
from the investigation committee to the city council.

823
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
I want to copy your way to success

824
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,920
and get into college.

825
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,880
You've investigated me before.

826
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,720
What do you mean?

827
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,880
You're a monster.

828
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,040
Are you a student

829
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,000
who is against the myth?

830
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,200
You're thinking too much.

831
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,400
There's no myth at all.

832
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,400
I'm just a free-spirited person.

833
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,520
If you want to be a committee member,

834
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
you can be a member of the city council.

835
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Senior Lin.

836
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,760
Senior Lin.

837
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,840
Where's the safe toilet you're using in the legend?

838
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,560
It's even more dangerous

839
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,480
to be tortured by the little girl.

840
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,520
Let me show you.

841
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,600
Okay.

842
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,280
It's better if you get near him.

843
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:27,860
He's

844
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,700
ased Nanyi.

845
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,460
Skinny little boy.

846
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,680
They were talking...

847
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,880
Shi Yu.

848
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,240
Your skills are so useful.

849
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,000
Right?

850
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,720
Three, two, one.

851
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,720
Let's go.

852
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,280
Shi Yu.

853
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,240
It's you.

854
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,440
Lang Xiao.

855
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,400
Why are you here too?

856
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,200
You didn't go home?

857
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,360
Well...

858
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,280
There's a bookstore ahead.

859
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I'll go buy books.

860
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,560
You caught this doll.

861
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,920
This is the limited edition

862
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,200
from the game shop ahead.

863
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,440
This...

864
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,240
This?

865
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,520
This is the limited edition.

866
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,960
This is the limited edition.

867
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,200
This is the limited edition.

868
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,240
This is the limited edition.

869
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
This is the limited edition.

870
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,200
This is the limited edition.

871
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,280
Really?

872
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,520
Maybe I bought too many books.

873
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,840
The boss gave me a lot.

874
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,880
Why are you here at this hour?

875
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
What else can I do if you lost?

876
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,480
Shi Yu, don't tell my sister.

877
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,880
I sent her a message about the glue.

878
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,000
She didn't reply.

879
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,880
How dare she?

880
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,040
I'll teach her a lesson.

881
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,760
It's okay.

882
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,200
Maybe she's not in a good mood

883
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,480
after the test.

884
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
She's in a bad mood.

885
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,880
She's the first one to count this time.

886
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,520
So wonderful.

887
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
You don't know?

888
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,680
I said something wrong.

889
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,800
You think you haven't heard it?

890
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,760
It's okay.

891
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,560
You're also caring about her.

892
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,200
Don't worry.

893
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,480
I won't betray you.

894
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,880
Gu Xue is lucky to have

895
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,480
such a good friend like you.

896
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,640
You just need to know it.

897
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,520
Don't...

898
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,480
Don't tell uncle and aunt.

899
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,080
Right.

900
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
I'll tell them.

901
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,800
Right.

902
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,080
Mom and dad don't know about this.

903
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,960
If they know,

904
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,520
they'll break her legs.

905
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,920
Gu Xue is lucky to have you.

906
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
Anyway,

907
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,360
don't tell them

908
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,760
that I told you.

909
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,640
I'm going home.

910
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,280
Bye.

911
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
I'll send you home.

912
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,760
No need.

913
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,680
Be careful when you go home.

914
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,000
Bye.

915
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Gu Mingze.

916
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
It's unfair.

917
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,080
Why do you have a spiritual master

918
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,120
when you're reviewing?

919
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,680
You call this reviewing?

920
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,680
Of course I'm reviewing.

921
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,240
I'm reviewing history.

922
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,360
My sister's

923
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,600
sad history.

924
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,040
I heard that you got worse than

925
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,160
the one you got in the first day.

926
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,480
You're the first one to count.

927
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,000
Hua Hua.

928
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,640
Is she the one who always

929
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,680
plays well on the court?

930
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
The one who plays well on the court

931
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,080
is the one who plays well on the court.

932
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
I'm not that kind of person.

933
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
I'm not that kind of person.

934
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I'm not that kind of person.

935
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
I'm not that kind of person.

936
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
I'm not that kind of person.

937
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,720
Brother,

938
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,840
the ball is not bad.

939
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,320
But it's not as good as your brother.

940
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,080
Give it back to me.

00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
No.

Hurry up. Give it to me.

00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Hit me.

I'll give it back to you.

00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,040
There is a sound very close

969
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,040
I know that must be you

970
