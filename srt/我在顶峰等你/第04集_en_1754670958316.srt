1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The flowers that bloom under the snow

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,700
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,300
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,100
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,700
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,500
Follow the rhythm and gently release

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,200
The night wind is lighting up the way

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,700
The bright smile

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,300
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:35,500
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have evidence to prove that I'm telling the truth.

16
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Tell me about it.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
We saw it just now.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Zhou Shiyun was heading in the direction of the vice director.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,500
He threw a ball from the position I was standing in.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,500
He fell on Zhou Shiyun along the throw line.

21
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,000
We all know that the direction of the power is based on the power point.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If I threw the ball,

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,000
how could Zhou Shiyun fall on the direction of the vice director?

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Shiyun, you always say that we are best friends.

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,000
Can we go back to the scene and show it to everyone again?

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,000
There is surveillance in every corner of the school.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It can restore the situation at any time.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But for the mental attack you have done to me today,

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
and the act of defamation,

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
I have the right to keep the right to sue.

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
I have to be a postman, vice director.

32
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
I'll go back first.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Xiao Guo has made a comprehensive statement.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Right?

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
We also keep the right to sue,

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,500
the right to the attack of reputation and the right to defamation.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
If you have any news, let us know.

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,000
Go.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,500
By the way,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
you all have my business card, right?

41
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
If you are not afraid of the East City,

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
just look for Yida Fang.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,500
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Children are now

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
indeed the most critical time.

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Yes. Yes. Yes.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
But if this kind of thing happens,

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
you two can rest assured.

49
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I will definitely solve this problem properly.

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Okay. Thank you.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Okay.

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Thank you, director.

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll go first.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,500
Slow down.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay. Okay. Okay.

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Take care.

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Xiao Lin.

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,000
Vice director.

59
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Why are you here?

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I've been listening for a long time.

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Come on. Hurry up.

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Come in.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
You said you have a big mouth.

64
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,000
Have some tea.

65
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Vice director, have some tea first.

66
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Otherwise, you can't suppress the anger of the students' parents.

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Did you hear it all just now?

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I found that these junior students

69
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
are really all

70
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
trying to find the truth.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
They are not clear about the truth.

72
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
They are determined to fight for their own interests.

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
They will not be wronged.

74
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Now these children

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
are more difficult to be treated than the first generation.

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
They are not as obedient as you were back then.

77
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
That's not right.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
You are not a obedient child.

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
You are a man who always pushes the front.

80
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I was worried about you back then.

81
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Each one has its own will.

82
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Vice director, did you call me here

83
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
to come to Yiwangxi?

84
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Of course not.

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Let's talk about something serious.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
How is the speech going?

87
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
The school needs an outstanding graduate like you

88
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
to help your junior students

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
to talk about your study process in Jinghai University.

90
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
You should cheer them up and shout out to them.

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Now, learning and thinking

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
must be done in one go.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Did you see that student who was so naughty?

94
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I asked him to stop the class on the spot.

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He said it was not good.

96
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
It's not good to say anything.

97
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Let's not talk about this.

98
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
How are you doing at school recently?

99
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I was suspended from school.

100
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Have some tea.

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
It's good for you.

102
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Is it true?

103
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Have some tea.

104
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm leaving, Zhou Yujiao.

105
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Bye.

106
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Bye.

107
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
No wonder Lin Zhihua likes to write in his part-time job.

108
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
He is always busy with work.

109
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
He is always efficient.

110
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Is this class 8, Class 3?

111
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Yes.

112
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Zhou Shiyun is a singer?

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I've heard about it.

114
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Gu Xuejiao.

115
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Mom.

116
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
If Zhou Shiyun's mom didn't tell you,

117
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
you wouldn't know that I broke into the school.

118
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I...

119
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Mom.

120
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I promise you.

121
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I didn't do anything.

122
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I only did one thing from the beginning to the end.

123
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
That is to stop the upgrade of the situation.

124
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
You didn't do anything.

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Why didn't you tell your family?

126
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
You were still hiding it.

127
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Because I know even if I told you that I didn't do anything,

128
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
you would still be like this.

129
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
You would hold me to apologize.

130
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
You would think that they would be upset.

131
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Whether it's your fault or not,

132
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
you should go and apologize to them first.

133
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
You should be soft.

134
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
You don't even hit a person with your hands.

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
You should lower your attitude.

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
You're always right.

137
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Mom.

138
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
How low is the attitude?

139
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,500
You're not blaming yourself for your own fault.

140
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Even if your attitude is low,

141
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
what can we get if our attitude is low?

142
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
It's an over-the-top drink that we can't finish.

143
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Xuejiao, come on.

144
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Drink.

145
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Why don't you drink?

146
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
She loves to drink this.

147
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
But it's expired.

148
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
You still can't finish those two faces.

150
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Can you arrange a job for her?

151
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Any job is fine.

152
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Anything.

153
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Zhou's company is very strict.

154
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
You think we two,

155
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
although we call each other relatives,

156
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
we don't have blood relations,

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm afraid Zhou can't arrange it.

158
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
You can understand.

159
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Zhou.

160
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Why are you so stubborn?

161
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
If you're like this,

162
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
how can you get along with your classmates?

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I...

164
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
I'm doing this for your own good.

165
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I don't need it.

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Mom.

167
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Actually, we don't need it.

168
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Jiaojiao.

169
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Jiaojiao, are you okay?

170
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I knew it.

171
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
It's all a misunderstanding.

172
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Auntie, why are you here?

173
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
It's okay. It's all a misunderstanding.

174
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Don't worry too much.

175
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
You're still sensible.

176
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Help me persuade Jiaojiao.

177
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
There's a little friction between the classmates.

178
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Big things are small, small things are small.

179
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
After all, the senior year is now the critical moment.

180
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Learning is the most important thing, right?

181
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Don't worry. I will definitely do it.

182
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Speaking of which,

183
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Jiaojiao, I'm really worried about you.

184
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
What's wrong with you?

185
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Your grades are down again.

186
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
You really can't do this anymore.

187
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Last time you went home in the morning,

188
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
I covered for you.

189
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I was already very angry.

190
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Wait.

191
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
She went home in the early morning.

192
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Auntie, you don't know this?

193
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Jiaojiao, I'm sorry.

194
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
You, you, don't.

195
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
You go home, go home.

196
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Go home, go home.

197
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Aunt, Aunt.

198
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Sorry, Shen Yu.

199
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I have something private to talk to Xue.

200
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Why don't you go home first?

201
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Don't let your mother worry.

202
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Okay.

203
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
It's all my fault.

204
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Auntie, don't be too angry.

205
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I know she didn't mean it.

206
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm leaving first.

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
You're crying for Xue.

208
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I knew you and Gu Mingze.

209
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
You two are having a fight.

210
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
You're a little girl.

211
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
You didn't go home for three nights.

212
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
What did you do?

213
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Tell me the truth.

214
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Mom.

215
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
You were told off by Zhou Shunyuan.

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Now I'm going to be scolded again, right?

217
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
I have nothing to say.

218
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Jiaojiao.

219
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
If you're okay, don't come back.

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
I love you.

221
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Gu.

222
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I just talked to Xue.

223
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I said it right.

224
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
What should I do?

225
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
We're leaving first.

226
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Bye.

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Bye.

228
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
What are you doing here?

229
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Go.

230
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
It's too late.

231
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
I don't want coffee.

232
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
This is hot chocolate.

233
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I'll treat you to it.

234
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Thank you.

235
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Aren't you going to the academy today?

236
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Why are you at the bookstore?

237
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
You still fight with the crowd in the afternoon.

238
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Why are you so depressed?

239
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
How do you know?

240
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I went to Qizhou this afternoon.

241
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I heard it.

242
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
You know I was suspended.

243
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
It's just a temporary suspension.

244
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Just wait for the results.

245
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Gu Jiaojiao.

246
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Do you remember your college entrance examination?

247
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Of course I remember.

248
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I saw you so upset.

249
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I thought you forgot.

250
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
It's not a big deal.

251
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
It doesn't affect my college entrance examination.

252
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
You're suspended.

253
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
How can you go to college?

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I'm like this.

255
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
You're still pushing me.

256
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
You've got me.

257
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
What else can't you do?

258
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
The bookshop is about to close.

259
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Let's go.

260
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You go.

261
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I'm going to sleep here today.

262
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
There are monsters here.

263
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
I'm going to sleep here.

264
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Let's go.

265
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
I'll take you to a place.

266
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Jinghai University.

267
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Why did you bring me here?

268
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Have you been here?

269
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Yes.

270
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I passed by here every day when I went to work.

271
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
What?

272
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I mean I haven't been there.

273
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
I don't have a student card.

274
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
I can only forget about the class.

275
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Stop.

276
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Let's go.

277
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Wow.

278
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
There must be two of them.

279
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Is Jinghai University

280
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
as big as three of them?

281
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Not really.

282
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Actually, I want to go to the lab.

283
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I want to see where you usually go to class.

284
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
I'll just look around when you get into the exam.

285
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Let's play a game.

286
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
I don't know how to play.

287
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
There are no rules.

288
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
As long as you score a goal,

289
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I'll fulfill your wish.

290
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Of course, it can't be illegal.

291
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
How about it?

292
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Are you serious?

293
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
If you lose, I'll call the police.

294
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Bag.

295
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Put the bag here.

296
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Come on.

297
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
It's starting.

298
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm going to play a game.

299
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm going to play a game.

300
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm going to play a game.

301
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Ouch.

302
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Can you do it?

303
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Yes.

304
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Women can't say no.

305
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
You don't have to let me.

306
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I just need to stand still.

307
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
What are you doing?

308
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Again.

309
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Come on.

310
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Again.

311
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Come on.

312
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Take two steps.

313
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Is the stadium big?

314
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Yes.

315
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Again.

316
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Again.

317
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm done.

318
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
You're a professional at bullying me.

319
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm just a bookworm.

320
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
But I know the use of playing baseball.

321
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
You also need to use your brain.

322
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm done. I'm going home.

323
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
You gave up so easily.

324
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
You little...

325
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I won.

326
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Bullshit.

327
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
How can this be called bullshit?

328
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Everyone will avoid it subconsciously.

329
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
How can you use your brain like this?

330
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I haven't said my wish yet.

331
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Isn't your wish to teach your master?

332
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Teach my master.

333
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Master.

334
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
No.

335
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Brother Li.

336
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
No.

337
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Brother Li.

338
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Can you help me persuade the school?

339
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I really can't think of a way.

340
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
You're so smart.

341
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Help me find a way.

342
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I'm almost your master.

343
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Although the stadium in Jingda is really beautiful,

344
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
we're lying here

345
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
and it's cold.

346
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Do you know how to enjoy it?

347
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Why are you so secretive?

348
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Because someone told me

349
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
as long as I live,

350
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I have a chance to turn the tables.

351
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Which spiritual guide

352
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
gave you the wisdom and wisdom?

353
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
I don't know.

354
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Let's check your recent review.

355
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
The first sentence of the first part of the play.

356
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Six kings must be one of the four seas.

357
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Count the mountains and five of the river.

358
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
I really know how to play.

359
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
On the earth,

360
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
which star is the brightest star in the solar system?

361
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Stars.

362
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
The thought system of the Sun's heart

363
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
is the same as the thought of the moon.

364
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
A宇航员

365
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
throws a small ball with a quality of M up.

366
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
The ball returns the time of the throwing point to T,

367
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
so that the quality of the moon and the earth is P,

368
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
and the radius is Q.

369
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
The speed of the center of gravity on the surface of the earth is G.

370
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
So when the宇航员

371
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
throws the small ball up,

372
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
the speed of the small ball is

373
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,500
V is equal to P G divided by 2 times Q square.

374
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Again.

375
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Is there any more difficult question?

376
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
I'll let you know what is

377
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
the beauty of the question,

378
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
the physical development of the language,

379
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
and the full development of the whole.

380
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
The development of the concept of universal evolution

381
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
was created in China

382
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
in the Western Han Dynasty.

383
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
The Chinese man Chu Zhenxun pointed out

384
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
that

385
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
he pointed out

386
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
that

387
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
OK.

388
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
You are the one who is well-educated,

389
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
and the physical development of the language

390
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
and the whole.

391
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Mr. He.

392
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Mr. He.

393
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
How did the Chinese man Chu Zhenxun

394
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
memorize it?

395
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I got it.

396
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Who?

397
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Who?

398
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Who is it?

399
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Stop.

400
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
The Chinese man Chu Zhenxun

401
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
has the sense of right and wrong.

402
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
There is right and wrong.

403
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
There is right and wrong.

404
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
There is right and wrong.

405
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Am I right?

406
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
No.

407
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Jian Tian.

408
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Thank you.

409
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Thank you.

410
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Although

411
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
I was wronged

412
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
and I was so depressed,

413
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I couldn't stop myself from taking the college entrance exam.

414
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm leaving.

415
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Where are you going?

416
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Home.

417
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Otherwise, my mom will think that I'm not going back

418
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
and I should have dropped the pearl.

419
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
It's too late. I'll see you out.

420
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Okay.

421
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I have something to tell you.

422
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
看我的家

423
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
It's open.

424
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Qing Hua?

425
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
What did I ask for?

426
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,280
When did you ask to have

427
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,500
a relationship with HA??

428
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
What relationship?

429
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,140
Okay.

430
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,660
Special law.

431
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,780
Then, we first take the point A

432
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,540
to the elliptical square,

433
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,500
right?

434
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,100
Then we can get what?

435
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,220
A is on the ellipse, right?

436
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,380
Then what else can we do?

437
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,580
Set Kaq and Kap separately

438
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,740
as 1 and negative 1, right?

439
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,220
Then we can get what?

440
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,940
We can get AQ and AB.

441
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,980
Why are you so serious?

442
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,420
It's already the end of the class.

443
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,180
Got it?

444
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,420
If you encounter such a problem again,

445
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,580
you can use this method.

446
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,620
Don't be so impatient.

447
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,180
Okay?

448
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,940
Don't be so impatient.

449
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,980
Got it.

450
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,740
The tiger-meat chicken is here.

451
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,980
Let the storm come more fierce.

452
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,260
Let's look at the next question.

453
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,140
Next question.

454
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,020
The 14th question.

455
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,780
Right?

456
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,220
What is this question?

457
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,380
Five Olympic volunteers

458
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,580
were randomly divided into

459
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,660
four different positions of ABCD.

460
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Each position has at least one volunteer.

461
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,980
Do you remember

462
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,580
what the teacher told you last time?

463
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,380
I remember.

464
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:38,980
I remember.

465
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,580
I remember.

466
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,180
I remember.

467
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,780
I remember.

468
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,380
I remember.

469
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,180
I remember.

470
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,980
I remember.

471
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,580
I remember.

472
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,180
I remember.

473
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,780
I remember.

474
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,580
I remember.

475
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,380
I remember.

476
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,180
I remember.

477
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,980
I remember.

478
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,780
I remember.

479
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,580
I remember.

480
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,380
I remember.

481
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,180
I remember.

482
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,980
I remember.

483
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,780
I remember.

484
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
I remember.

485
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,580
I remember.

486
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,380
I remember.

487
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,180
I remember.

488
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,980
I remember.

489
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,780
I remember.

490
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,580
I remember.

491
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,380
I remember.

492
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,180
I remember.

493
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
I remember.

494
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,980
I remember.

495
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,780
I remember.

496
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,780
I remember.

497
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
I remember.

498
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,580
I remember.

499
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,580
I remember.

500
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,780
I remember.

501
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,580
I remember.

502
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
I remember.

503
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,780
I remember.

504
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
I remember.

505
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,580
I remember.

506
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,380
I remember.

507
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,180
I remember.

508
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,980
I remember.

509
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,780
Where's the fish well?

510
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
I'm almost out of stock.

511
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,380
How's it going?

512
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,540
I've been a teacher for a lifetime.

513
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,060
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,100
Don't be lazy.

515
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,980
Lin, let me tell you.

516
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,220
It's useless to talk about it.

517
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,180
Students are students.

518
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,820
They are students.

519
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,620
As long as I'm still in the position of the teacher,

520
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,420
I'll stay here for a day.

521
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,700
If the students are affected,

522
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,020
I'll leave the school.

523
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,660
Let's go out.

524
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,780
What?

525
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,740
I haven't been back for a long time.

526
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,020
I want to go out.

527
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,260
If I don't go, you go by yourself.

528
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,540
Lin, let me go.

529
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,060
I'll check it.

530
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,660
What are you doing?

531
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,860
Come on.

532
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,340
You can't enjoy being alone.

533
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,060
That's great.

534
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,020
Yi Tianyu.

535
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,860
Yi Tianyu.

536
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Why did you go up there?

537
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,380
Do you know it?

538
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,980
I know it.

539
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,500
You know it.

540
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,580
The whole class knows it.

541
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,260
Come on. Tell me.

542
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,820
What kind of method should this question be used

543
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,100
to solve this question?

544
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,140
It's been a long time since I've been back.

545
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,340
I will use force mystery truthfully.

546
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Mr. Fu,

547
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,880
it's a hot weather these days.

548
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,020
Of course.

549
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,780
Or will I be corrupt?

550
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,380
This kid

551
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,980
brought a warden with him?

552
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,740
He is cute and波浪殆不息

553
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,500
Director Lu

554
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,580
Indeed.

555
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,940
I've been so thoughtful.

556
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm going to the top!

557
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,100
Why did she

558
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,740
insist on going to school with pheasant skin?

559
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,980
About the

560
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,980
I don't know

561
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,980
If just

562
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:16,180
Love it

563
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,920
The senior eight grade

564
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,200
The plan can't be changed.

565
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,240
I almost got killed by the heat.

566
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,240
Tell me, Zhang Guo.

567
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,040
Of course it's a big problem.

568
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I'm back to school.

569
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,920
Congratulations.

570
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,400
But the person who wronged you didn't get punished.

571
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,640
Can you give up?

572
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,880
You hate injustice the most, don't you?

573
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,800
Why should I care about kids?

574
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm a good kid.

575
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
You're not a kid.

576
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,320
Right, you?

577
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,280
Yes.

578
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,520
This is me.

579
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,280
What leave do you have?

580
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,640
I need to talk.

581
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Don't Prince B relativize me myself.

582
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
I've helped you with the class.

583
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
What else do you need?

584
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,800
I've helped you with the class.

585
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,520
But the teacher has a condition.

586
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,360
He said I should do a mock exam next time.

587
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,440
I need to get into the top 100.

588
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,200
What?

589
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,160
Top 100!

590
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,800
Here.

591
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,280
Senior Wei,

592
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,800
don't go. Help me.

593
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,960
Don't use the trick of dealing with the vice director.

594
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,080
Sit down first.

595
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,160
Sit down.

596
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,560
Sit down.

597
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,360
Show me your score list.

598
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,440
Show me.

599
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Isn't the vice director joking?

600
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,840
Read it.

601
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,240
The language is 89.

602
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,400
The English is 81.

603
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,160
Mathematics.

604
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,400
Mathematics.

605
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,800
58.

606
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,040
I was scared when I was taking math tests.

607
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,880
So I failed.

608
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
The second place in the whole grade.

609
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,800
How many people are there in your grade?

610
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,560
Four or five hundred.

611
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,680
Don't you believe it?

612
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,480
I had a good score before I was in the second grade.

613
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,640
But I was blinded by the painting world.

614
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,080
But I'm lost now.

615
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,720
All I care about now is studying.

616
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,800
I love you.

617
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,560
You only care about studying.

618
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,880
Don't think about your past achievements.

619
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,200
Although it's not an achievement.

620
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,160
You've been beaten up since you were a kid.

621
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,640
Have you really been beaten up because of your mouth?

622
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,680
It's still three months away from the end of the year.

623
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Unless you're not sleeping and resting 24 hours a day.

624
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,120
You'll never forget it.

625
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,960
But I'm not fighting alone.

626
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,920
I have a buff.

627
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,720
Me?

628
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,360
Buff.

629
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,120
You'll help me.

630
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,000
Thanks.

631
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,680
Time is tight and不用 ine bombers.

632
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,160
Let's start now.

633
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,640
You're going to make it work.

634
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,360
The first plan is

635
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,480
that each review room

636
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,000
will be in line with

637
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
the rules of the I-DIN House.

638
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,760
One, two, three, four.

639
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,760
Five.

640
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,720
I'm billiards.

641
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,960
It's urgent.

642
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,000
One, two, three, four.

643
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,640
Let me change.

644
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,200
One, two, three, four.

645
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,600
I'm billiards.

646
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,560
Hello.

647
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,960
Fifty.

648
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,200
Thank you.

649
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,000
Use fake news to make a joke.

650
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,920
My amount of exercise

651
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,120
is at my limit.

652
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,640
My body needs an ambulance.

653
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,000
If I can,

654
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,960
I'll do it.

655
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,160
You have to walk.

656
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,440
Walk slowly.

657
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,640
One, two, three, four.

658
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,120
What kind of sugar is starch?

659
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,160
Sugar.

660
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,400
What about sugar?

661
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,160
Sugar, grape sugar,

662
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,440
fruit sugar, and sweetened condensed milk.

663
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,440
Anyway,

664
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,120
it's sugar you don't like.

665
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,080
It's not that absolute.

666
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,040
Next question.

667
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,320
Brother Shi,

668
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,200
can you give me

669
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,640
a question I know?

670
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,280
Grapes, grape sugar,

671
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,560
fruit sugar, sweetened condensed milk.

672
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,360
The function of PVP balance

673
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,880
and economic system environment is...

674
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,200
Honey,

675
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,040
what do you think

676
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,840
are these answers?

677
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,280
Why do you ask?

678
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
It's a history question.

679
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,120
History question.

680
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,000
Our family

681
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
has been in a good mood for the last life.

682
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,760
We have a senior Gao

683
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,040
and a junior Lin.

684
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,520
Before the big festival,

685
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,480
we even gave them

686
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
a treat.

687
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,440
How nice!

688
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,320
Yes.

689
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,440
I think

690
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,040
we should invite

691
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,400
Brother Ming here

692
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,000
to have a meal with him.

693
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,960
Yes.

694
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,040
Is it Xue Jiao?

695
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,240
Let me talk to her.

696
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,520
What's wrong?

697
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,320
What's wrong with her?

698
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,520
But her brother is handsome.

699
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,640
Don't worry about me.

700
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,480
I want him to make up for my lessons.

701
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,160
What method did he use

702
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,040
to make you stay up

703
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,840
even if the new year is coming?

704
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,680
And I

705
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,040
want to persuade you to have a reunion meal.

706
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,840
It's so hard.

707
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,720
Your parents have decided

708
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,000
to have a new year with Xia Wei Yi.

709
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,520
I've got the tickets for you.

710
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,400
If you don't want to go,

711
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,360
think of a gift yourself.

712
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,240
There are too many times difference.

713
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,080
It's not convenient to make up for lessons.

714
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,440
So,

715
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,920
you won't join the new year's meeting?

716
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,200
What a coincidence!

717
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,160
I have an appointment.

718
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,360
Brother Lin,

719
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,320
come to my house

720
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,360
for a meal one day

721
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,240
to write an experiment.

722
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,080
You're so

723
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,800
hard-working.

724
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,720
You have a delivery?

725
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,880
When did you learn how to order online?

726
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,920
You haven't got your first-year certificate yet, have you?

727
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,480
My

728
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,760
new job is to writeeres.

729
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,200
I have freedom to write exam papers.

730
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,480
My land is run by someone

731
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,240
and this is being kept by someone else.

732
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,600
I tried toactive less

733
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,720
for class,

734
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,480
but they didn't agree.

735
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,880
Can you weapons king

736
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,440
and warranty inn terminus

737
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,840
sell with other country?

738
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,200
Jing Smiley

739
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
You said you were ready from the beginning,

740
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,880
But

741
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,840
No, you won't like this,

742
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,160
it's okay,

743
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,080
she can get used to it.

744
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,400
If you can get worn out,

745
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,080
she would also get sick right away.

746
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,560
You can go on a trip,

747
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,000
then you won't feel this way.

748
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't like it.

749
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,200
I don't like it too.

750
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,520
Stop it.

751
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm going at the concert here.

752
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,440
I'm just going to lie in bed.

753
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,380
affect

754
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,480
that grown-up one to fly.

755
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,840
You are a good daughter and a sweet daughter.

756
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Why so downhearted?

757
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,480
Well,

758
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:11,900
What?

759
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,420
Yin dad

760
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,420
How come?

761
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,820
I get it

762
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:20,700
What?

763
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,580
What's wrong with you?

764
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,220
I win

765
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,180
Win

766
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,020
Win

767
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,020
What?

768
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,020
Of course, my brother bought the stock.

769
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,020
What did he earn?

770
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,020
I know. He earned through the wire.

771
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
He's doing physical experiments.

772
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
That's great.

773
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
The water is boiling. Let's make dumplings.

774
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,020
Okay.

775
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:03,020
Students, we're going to eat dumplings.

776
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Don't laugh.

777
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
I'll hold it.

778
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
Turn it around.

779
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
It must be delicious.

780
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,020
New Year's Day, New Year's Day, New Year's Day.

781
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
Let's make dumplings.

782
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,020
But the bike will be a motorcycle.

783
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,020
Gu Xuejiao, our good days are coming.

784
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,020
Here we are. Dumplings are here.

785
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,020
Here we are.

786
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,020
Dumplings are here.

787
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,020
Be careful.

788
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
You're not in a hurry to study.

789
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,020
You're the best at eating.

790
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,020
Is it hot?

791
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
The guests haven't moved yet.

792
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
Drink some water. Your mouth is hot.

793
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,020
Xiaoling, drink with Mingze.

794
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,020
How can I let the child drink?

795
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,020
You're not serious.

796
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,020
It's okay. I'll drink some.

797
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
I'll drink some.

798
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Okay.

799
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Thank you, uncle.

800
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
You're welcome.

801
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
This wine is old.

802
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Drink less.

803
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,020
Let's make a toast.

804
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,020
Come on.

805
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,020
Today, on behalf of the family,

806
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,020
I thank Xiaoling.

807
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
During this time,

808
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,020
I have been doing my best to make up for them.

809
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,020
Thank you.

810
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
I'm not stupid.

811
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,020
I wish you a happy meal today.

812
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
I'm happy.

813
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
I'm warm.

814
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,020
Cheers.

815
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
Cheers.

816
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Move the chopsticks.

817
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,020
This dumpling is a good idea.

818
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
Don't touch it.

819
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
You...

820
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Your sister said that

821
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
it's good for your health to put the coin in.

822
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
So I put peanuts in it.

823
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Peanuts.

824
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Good things happen.

825
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,020
Good.

826
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
I think I've eaten it.

827
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
I think I've eaten it.

828
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,020
What about you?

829
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
No, I've eaten it too.

830
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Lin Shige.

831
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,020
I wish you a happy new year.

832
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,020
Good luck.

833
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,020
I wish Gu a smooth entrance exam.

834
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
I can't.

835
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,020
I'm so dirty.

836
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Go to the bathroom.

837
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
Go.

838
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,020
No.

839
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
I've eaten too much.

840
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
It's a little smelly.

841
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
I need to digest it.

842
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,020
Go.

843
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,020
I'll eat the starch.

844
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,020
Enough.

845
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
Stop talking.

846
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,020
You're biting your tongue.

847
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Bye.

848
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,020
Come on, Xiaoling.

849
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Try it.

850
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Thank you.

851
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,020
Do you have it?

852
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,020
The great designer Gu.

853
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,020
Yes.

854
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,020
How did you know I was here?

855
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
You've been photographed.

856
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,020
Come on.

857
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,020
Let's go.

858
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,020
Come on.

859
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I said...

860
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Stop pulling me.

861
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
I said you can't touch my home.

862
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,020
You didn't touch my home.

863
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
Xiaoling, why are you here?

864
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,020
Happy New Year, director.

865
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,020
I'm not going to celebrate the festival.

866
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Come and relax.

867
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,020
What a coincidence.

868
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
Someone sent me an anonymous message just now.

869
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
It said that students from our school

870
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
came to this Internet bar.

871
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
Why is director Fu here?

872
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,020
How do I know?

873
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
My wife and I are having dinner with my child.

874
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
He's in bad luck.

875
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,020
Come on.

876
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Let's catch a blind man.

877
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,020
Director.

878
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,020
What should I do?

879
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,020
He saw me acting.

880
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,020
Be smart.

881
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,020
I didn't go there.

882
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Come on.

883
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,020
I want to think about the speech

884
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
you said when I went back to school.

885
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
Didn't you refuse me last time?

886
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,020
You want to come?

887
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Come on.

888
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,020
Xiaoling, what's wrong?

889
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Why are you so reckless?

890
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,020
Do you want to pass the message?

891
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,020
I don't play this either.

892
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,020
Stop.

893
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,020
You're so fast.

894
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,020
Why do I see you look so familiar?

895
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Are you from the seventh grade?

896
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,020
Yes.

897
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,020
No.

898
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,020
You changed your mind again.

899
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Tell me.

900
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,020
What grade are you in?

901
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Well,

902
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
I've graduated.

903
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,020
You've graduated?

904
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,020
It's okay if you've graduated.

905
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,020
By the way,

906
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
which university are you in?

907
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
Gallaudet University of England.

908
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
Gallaudet University?

909
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Yes.

910
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Is there such a university?

911
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,020
We're here.

912
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,020
We're here.

913
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,020
We're here.

914
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,020
We're here.

915
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,020
We're here.

916
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,020
We're here.

917
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,020
We're here.

918
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,020
We're here.

919
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,020
We're here.

920
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,020
We're here.

921
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,020
We're here.

922
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,020
We're here.

923
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,020
We're here.

924
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,020
We're here.

925
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,020
We're here.

926
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,020
We're here.

927
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,020
We're here.

928
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,020
We're here.

929
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,020
We're here.

930
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,020
We're here.

931
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,020
We're here.

932
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,020
We're here.

933
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,020
We're here.

934
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,020
We're here.

935
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,020
We're here.

936
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,020
We're here.

937
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,020
We're here.

938
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
We're here.

939
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
We're here.

940
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,020
I read the secrets in my eyes.

941
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:05,020
I will find you are always in my heart.

942
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:16,020
I try to open my hands.

943
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,020
Because the one I love is sure.

944
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,020
I'm listening to the wind.

945
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,020
The wind is blowing.

946
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,020
It doesn't matter.

947
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
There is a sound.

948
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,020
Very close.

949
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,020
I know it must be you.

950
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,020
I try to open my hands.

951
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,020
Because the one I love is sure.

00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,020
I'm listening to the wind.

953
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,020
The wind is blowing.

954
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:59,020
It doesn't matter.

955
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,020
There is a sound.

956
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,020
Very close.

957
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,020
I know it must be you.

958
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,020
The wind is blowing.

959
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,020
It doesn't matter.

960
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,020
There is a sound.

961
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,020
Very close.

962
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,020
I know it must be you.
