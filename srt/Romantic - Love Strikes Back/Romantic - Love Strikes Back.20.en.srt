[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 20]

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,960
Listen,

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,520
if you cooperate
with me gently right now,

4
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,040
I can still treat you nicely,

5
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,320
or I'll kill you.

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
Get out.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,000
How dare you hit me?

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,400
Let me go.

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,120
I'll deal with you later.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,600
Hello.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,160
What?

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,720
Please wait.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,040
Mr. Chen, didn't we agree

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,200
that you would sell
your 5% shares to me?

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,640
We can negotiate
if the price is not satisfying.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,720
Hello.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,000
Mr. Chen...

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,160
What?

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Breaking the promise?

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,520
Hello.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
What? Mingde is not supporting me?

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,640
He even asks me
to pay it back immediately?

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,760
Hello.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,560
What's going on?

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,400
Didn't we agree
to acquire Lin Corporation before?

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Why did you suddenly stop?
Are you fooling me around?

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,680
I didn't mean that.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Perhaps, I

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
was too anxious.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,840
I just want to ask you
to continue lending me the money

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,640
to complete the acquisition
of Lin Corporation.

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Actually, I've already completed
more than half of it.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,120
Tomorrow, after tomorrow,

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,880
I'll have completely done it.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,040
Starting tomorrow, Lin Corporation
and Mingde won't be enemies anymore.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,200
We will be friends,

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,400
family.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Xiao Mo.

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,560
Are you still lacking 5%?

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,800
You don't have any chance.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,240
I've bought those 5% shares.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,080
Impossible, how could you buy it?

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,120
Given that you can't
complete the acquisition,

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,240
Mingde will also
withdraw all the investments.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,880
In addition, the contract says

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
if you can't complete the acquisition,

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,520
you will triple the investment amount
to compensate Mingde.

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,080
Security.

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,040
How is that possible?

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
That's totally impossible.

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,200
Let me go.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,640
Mr. Xiao.

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,640
Mr. Xiao, I was wrong.

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,400
I didn't know my place.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,720
Mr. Xiao, please give me some time.

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,200
I can't get so much money right now.

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
I will definitely pay Mingde back.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Please give me some time.

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,240
I don't want Lin Yan anymore.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,760
I will give Lin Yan to you.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Mr. Xiao.

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,800
Ma Chengjun.

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,520
Do you have the guts to repeat
what you've just said?

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm warning you for the last time.

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,080
If you dare to show
any disrespect to Lin Yan again,

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,080
I won't spare you.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,240
Get out.

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,280
Xiao Mo, were all of you
team up to trick me?

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Xiao Mo,

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,800
You just wait.

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,360
I have followed your request

72
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,880
to withdraw funding for Ma Chengjun.

73
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,000
So, shouldn't you

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,800
also fulfill your promise

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,760
to come back and take over Mingde?

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,320
I won't break my promise to you.

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
Very good.

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,360
Then, let's have dinner together.

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Let's celebrate it.

80
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,880
I still have something to do.
I'll leave.

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,440
Remember what you've just said.

82
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,120
Don't interfere with Lin Corporation
again in the future.

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
Sir, please don't worry.

84
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,160
Your son will definitely
understand your good intentions.

85
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,840
What am I sad about?

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm so happy.

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Did you see?

88
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,720
My son...

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,400
He finally took the initiative
to talk to me.

90
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,820
[Exit]

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
What are you doing, Ma Chengjun?

92
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
I've said it before,
I won't sell my shares.

93
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,080
I didn't come to buy your shares today.

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
I want you to buy my shares.

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,880
You and Lin Yan
are in a takeover battle.

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,680
You asked me to buy your shares,

97
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,600
are you thinking I'm stupid?

98
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,600
Okay then,

99
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
forget about the shares.

100
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Please lend me some money,

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,760
so that I can pay the interest
I owed to Mingde first.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,440
You want me to help you?

103
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,040
Lin Yan is my niece.

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
We are family.

105
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,360
How could I betray my family?

106
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,320
Uncle,

107
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,320
I have given you so much benefit

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
at Lin Corporation
for the past three years.

109
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,400
I don't understand what you're saying.

110
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,840
Are you out of your mind?

111
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
You rat!

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
I was wrong, Yan.

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,680
I was wrong.

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,680
Yan, you have to believe me.

115
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,960
That was Wen Lili's idea.

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,640
I was momentarily obsessed.

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,680
I listened to her advice
to acquire Lin Corporation.

118
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,400
She was the one who forced me.

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,160
Weren't you just showing off earlier

120
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,800
to change Lin Corporation
to Ma Corporation?

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,400
Why are you begging
for my mercy so quickly?

122
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Yan.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Mingde is now asking me

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,160
to pay them back three times the money.

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,880
How can I have so much money?

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
You know Mingde.

127
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,360
They have a hundred ways to kill me.

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,000
You will help me, right?

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Yan.

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm just begging you for the last time.

131
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,800
One thing only.

132
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,960
Plead for me in front of Xiao Mo.

133
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,880
Please.

134
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,760
I'm begging you.

135
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,120
Please ask Mingde to let me go.

136
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,800
What do you mean?

137
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Yan, at this time,

138
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
we don't need to pretend anymore, right?

139
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,880
I didn't know my place before.

140
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,640
I didn't know that Xiao Mo

141
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,560
is Mingde's heir.

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,760
Or, I would never
be against both of you.

143
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,200
I will raise my hand and agree.

144
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,760
I will support you completely.

145
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Yan, I'm begging you.

146
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
Yan, I'm begging you.

147
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Yan.

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,520
Just get out.

149
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,200
Yan.

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,080
I don't want to see you anymore.

151
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
Yan, I'm begging you.

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Yan.

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Get out!

154
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,560
I didn't know my place before.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,160
I didn't know that Xiao Mo

156
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,200
is Mingde's heir.

157
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm related to Mingde,

158
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,280
but I'd never do anything

159
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,200
to harm you or Lin Corporation.

160
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,400
(Xiao Mo,)

161
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,920
(how many secrets do you have
that I don't know about?)

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Where is Xiao Mo?

163
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,800
Mr. Xiao? It's been a while
since Mr. Xiao came to the company.

164
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,080
Mr. Xiao is not with you?

165
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,200
Mrs. Xiao, did you have a quarrel
with Mr. Xiao?

166
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,320
I'll take my leave.

167
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,120
Mrs. Xiao,

168
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,040
wait.

169
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,720
I think

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,880
you shouldn't quarrel with Mr. Xiao.

171
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,080
Mr. Xiao is very nice to you.

172
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,120
I've been with Mr. Xiao
for so many years.

173
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
I've never seen him

174
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,120
so attached to any other woman.

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
Wait a second.

176
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,760
Please take a look first.

177
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,800
Three years ago, Mr. Xiao knew
that you would marry Ma Chengjun.

178
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,640
He was so sad and went abroad.

179
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,640
He thought that he would have
no chance to see you again.

180
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,000
Later on, something happened
on your wedding day.

181
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,320
Mr. Xiao gave up everything

182
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720
and decided to come back.

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
Then, he's always by your side.

184
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Even this company,

185
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
was founded for you.

186
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
He just hoped that when you wake up,

187
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,360
he'd have enough capability to help you.

188
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,920
I was Mr. Lin's assistant
and personal bodyguard.

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,280
So, do you mean

190
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,480
that you also want me to be

191
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,240
your all day personal bodyguard?

192
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,920
Is that so?

193
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
These were all collected
by Mr. Xiao.

194
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
The past three years, he's read
the record carefully and taken notes

195
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,640
every time

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,640
[Stray Birds]
he got all the medical records.

197
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,200
He has been waiting for you to wake up.

198
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,960
(At that time, Mr. Xiao went
to the hospital to see you every week.)

199
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,400
(These three years,)

200
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
(no matter what happened,
he would go on time)

201
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
(and never stopped.)

202
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,800
(Sometimes,)

203
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,120
it seemed like
I could feel someone accompanying me.

204
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,000
Though I couldn't see his face clearly,

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
I could feel him.

that these three years,)

been by my side is you.)
