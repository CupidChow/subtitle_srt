00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,320

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,160
Three.

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,840
Two.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,000
One.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,840
Time flies, doesn't it?

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,960
Not long ago,

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,440
Yan, you were just a little kid.

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,120
At that time, you pestered me

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,800
for bedtime stories every day.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
In the blink of an eye, you've grown up.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,520
Dad, I would like
to introduce someone to you today.

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,520
Okay.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Chengjun.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
Yan.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,640
Dad.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,320
Uncle, my name is Ma Chengjun.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm Lin Yan's boyfriend.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,440
I don't understand

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,280
why you don't like Chengjun so much.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,080
Ma Chengjun, has an ulterior motive.

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,840
I don't agree.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,920
You're biased.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,960
It was just because he comes
from a poor family.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,000
He is a sincere and motivated person.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,120
He will make me happy.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,280
If you still don't agree,

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,040
I will leave home.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,680
I will prove you wrong.

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,040
If you dare to step out today,

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,240
I, Lin Yihai, won't see you
as my daughter anymore.

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,600
(Miss Lin.)

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
(Mr. Lin is not in good condition.)

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,780
[Under operation]

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,880
Dad!

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,840
Dad!

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
In these three years,

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,440
I haven't completely lost sensation.

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
Sometimes,

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,080
it seemed like I could
feel someone accompanying me.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,280
Though I couldn't see his face clearly,

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,920
(I could feel him.)

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,280
[That I trust your love]
(Stray birds of summer)

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
(come to my window to sing)

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,520
(and fly away.)

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,760
(And yellow leaves of autumn,)

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
(which have no songs,)

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,120
(flutter and fall there with a sign.)

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
Maybe it was because
I missed Dad too much.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,560
So,

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
even if he's passed away,

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
I still felt like he was with me

54
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,720
and encouraging me.

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,160
Accompanying me
through the toughest times.

56
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Your dad has always loved you very much.

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,320
I really miss him.

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,560
I haven't seen such a starry sky
in a long time.

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
Don't you want to make a wish?

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
When I was young,

61
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,840
my dad gave me a book
called "Stray Birds" by Tagore.

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
There is a sentence in it
that I really like.

63
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,240
"Stray birds of summer

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440

65
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,960
and fly away.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
And yellow leaves of autumn,

67
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,560
which have no songs,

68
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
flutter and fall there with a sign."

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,520
I really regret it.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,400
When Dad was still alive,

71
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,560
I always made him angry.

72
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,400
I didn't spend enough time with him

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
and cherish him.

74
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,560
But the beauty of the world
is like this shooting star,

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,720
gone in an instant,

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,400
and never going back.

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,760
Tagore also said,

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,760
"If you shed tears
when you miss the sun,

79
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,840
you also miss the stars."

80
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,760
He won't blame you.

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
He'll watch over you

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,960
like the stars in the sky.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
He just changed his approach.

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,280
If you miss your dad,

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,880
just look up at the stars.

86
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,800
He definitely wants you to be happy.

87
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,360
Are there any shooting stars?

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,160
I have a lot of things to say to my dad.

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,360
Do you want to watch a meteor shower?

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
I'll take you there.

91
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
Why are you bringing me here?

92
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,000
You'll know in a moment.

93
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,960
Gather.

94
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,240
Standing at attention.

95
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,640
- Hi, Mr. Xiao.
- Hi, Mr. Xiao.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,800
- Hi, Mrs. Xiao.
- Hi, Mrs. Xiao.

97
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,000
Mr. Xiao,

98
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,840
everything is ready.

99
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,560
Let's get started.

100
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,320
Standing at attention.

101
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,640
Turn back.

102
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,800
Is this the meteor shower
you were talking about?

103
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Do you like it?

104
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
Yes.

105
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,880
As long as it's what you want,

106
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,520
and no matter what it is,

107
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,400
I will try my best to do it.

108
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,800
Dad.

109
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,560
I will work hard to be happy

110
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
and take good care of myself.

111
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,720
Dad, I will always miss you.

112
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Lin Yan.

113
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,600
I have something
particularly important to tell you.

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
Why are you suddenly so serious?

115
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Xiao Mo,

116
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,800
28 years old this year.

117
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Joined the military after graduating
from a foreign university.

118
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,000
After retiring from the special forces,
he joined a mercenary army.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,720
After returning home,

120
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,600
he became a special assistant
to Mr. Lin by mistake.

121
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
From then on,

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,800
he had a new goal in his life.

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,920
Because the moment
he entered the company,

124
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,160
he was deeply fascinated by a girl.

125
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,040
At first, she turned a blind eye to him.

126
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,600
Until one day,

127
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
he had the opportunity
to stand in front of her again.

128
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,160
This girl...

129
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,400
