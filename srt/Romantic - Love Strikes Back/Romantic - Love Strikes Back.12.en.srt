[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 12]

2
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,320
Surprise, huh?

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,560
Why is he here?

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,560
Why are you two living together?

5
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,240
I just saw him fastening his buttons.

6
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,640
Aren't you two already...

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,800
Oh, my goodness.

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,800
Black and white matching stuff.

9
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,480
What's it with you?

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,520
What's your deal with him?

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,800
Ma Chengjun.

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
Ma Chengjun?

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,360
You used to call me Jun.

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
You're not really
cheating on me, are you?

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,240
Xiao Mo lives here

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,880
because he is my bodyguard.

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,840
He needs to be close
to protect me 24/7.

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,880
I have told you everything.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,200
If you don't believe me, so be it.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
I'm tired and I'll go to bed first.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Sending off the guest.

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,720
I've had enough of it.

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,480
You must make a choice today.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,000
Either he leaves

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,040
or I leave.

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,400
You choose.

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,400
Chengjun.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,360
I realize I didn't know anything
about you.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,320
In my heart,

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,720
Chengjun

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,720
is a gentle,

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,440
generous,

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,120
and understanding person.

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,840
He never argues with me

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
over these small matters.

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,280
It seems like

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,400
it's time for us to take a closer look
at our relationship.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,400
After all this, you still want me
to be considerate?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
What does it mean?

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
Are you breaking up with me?

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,800
Let's calm down for a while.

42
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,480
Yan.

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,840
Yan.

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,760
Stop pulling me.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Xiao Mo,

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,560
let me tell you.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,360
You can't covet

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,640
a married woman.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Being someone's paramour,

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,000
you will be in for a rough time.

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,520
She seems to have never agreed

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
to marry you
from the beginning, right?

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,960
My Yan is too busy now.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
She just doesn't want
to marry me for now.

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Actually, when it comes to women,

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,760
it's not about wanting
to get married now or not.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,160
It's about wanting to marry you

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,600
or not wanting to marry you.

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,120
You!

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,880
It's getting late.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
We need to rest now.

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,000
Please leave.

63
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
I've never seen

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,400
such a shameless paramour in my life.

65
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,520
She actually chose that Xiao Mo.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,240
She actually drove me away.

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,120
Ma Chengjun.

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,520
Do you only have Lin Yan in your heart?

69
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,120
Absolutely impossible.

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,480
How could anyone

71
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,560
in this world refuse me, Ma Chengjun?

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm such an excellent man.

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,880
No one can take what belongs to me.

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Lin Yan,

75
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
you belong to me.

76
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,320
Are you mad?

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
You've really lost it over Lin Yan.

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,960
Lin Yan.

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,200
Lin Yan.

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,080
I will

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,280
snatch you back.

82
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,480
Ma Chengjun, how dare you do this to me?

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Yan.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,080
I will snatch you back.

85
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
Ma Chengjun!

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,960
Ma Chengjun!

87
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,680
Drink some milk later.

88
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,040
Why did you kiss me just now?

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Didn't you say I had overdone it before?

90
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
Ma Chengjun wasn't here just now either.

91
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Please calm down.

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,720
It's Ma Chengjun who needs to calm down.

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm very hot now.

94
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,880
I overheard what you two
was talking about

95
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
downstairs.

96
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,520
Is there any problem?

97
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,000
I told Ma Chengjun
that we should cool off for a bit

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,320
to scare him.

99
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,880
I can't break up with him

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,520
until I take over Lin Corporation.

101
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,920
Also

102
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,760
I want to remind you.

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,320
We are only
in a professional relationship.

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,800
You're just my bodyguard.

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,680
You shouldn't get so involved
in my personal life.

106
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,520
Moreover,

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,280
the most important thing now
is to reassure Ma Chengjun.

108
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,880
Is your heart made of stone?

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Don't you have any feelings for me?

110
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,200
What I'm most concerned about now
is how to retake Lin Corporation.

111
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,040
Other things mean nothing to me.

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,960
These are all excuses.

113
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
You have feelings for me.

114
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,440
You should know where you stand.

115
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,760
You haven't taken a day off
since you came.

116
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,280
Take two days off

117
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
to get a good rest.

118
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,440
Okay, I got it.

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
I will make sure I know where I stand.

120
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,160
Actually, you're the one
who wants to take a break, right?

121
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,520
Mr. Xiao,

122
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
Mr. He asked you to meet him this time,
no matter what.

123
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,120
Okay, I got it.

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,920
(Chengjun,)

125
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,920
the assets you transferred
from Lin Corporation over the years

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
are enough for us to spend
for the rest of our lives.

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,520
Even if Lin Yan

128
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,120
snatched Lin Corporation back,

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
it's just an empty shell.

130
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,080
Why don't we take this money
and go abroad?

131
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,440
You don't understand.

132
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,400
I must get Lin Corporation.

133
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,000
No.

134
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,720
I must marry Lin Yan immediately.

135
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
Ma Chengjun,

136
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,160
do you want the Lin Corporation

137
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,120
or Lin Yan?

138
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,080
I want them all.

139
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,240
I, Ma Chengjun, have never lost.

140
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,320
Why do you keep mentioning Lin Yan?

141
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,080
You don't really think you can
replace Lin Yan, do you?

142
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,400
Ma Chengjun,

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,280
what do you take me for?

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm nothing in your eyes.

145
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm not even as important as a dog.

146
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,320
Since you said so,

147
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,680
I'll make it clear.

148
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
You don't deserve

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
to be Mrs. Ma.

150
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
Ma Chengjun.

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,520
If I don't get what I want,

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,320
then you won't either.

153
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,720
You'd better behave well,

154
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,680
then our relationship can continue.

155
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,600
If you keep causing trouble
every other day...

156
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Just piss off.

157
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,960
(Lin Yan.)

158
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,240
(Why can you easily have everything?)

159
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,320
(Why am I trying my best
but still get rejected?)

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
(I want you to taste)

161
