[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 9]

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,560
So, it doesn't matter
if anyone kisses you?

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,280
Yes, it doesn't matter.

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,840
What's wrong with you, Xiao Mo?

5
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,600
You're just an assistant I hired.

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,040
You have no right to interfere
in my personal affairs.

7
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm warning you.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,640
If you can't control your emotions
and offend me again like this,

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,720
you can just leave.

10
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,440
Come.

11
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,280
Be quick.

12
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
How did you get in?

13
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
You're my fiancee.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Who would stop me?

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,000
What do you want to do?

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm right here.

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,920
Isn't it obvious yet?

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
We're getting married soon.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,880
What else can we do?

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Chengjun,

21
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm not ready yet. I think...

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,360
What else do you need?

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
We should have been together
three years ago.

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,120
I've been waiting for three years.

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,480
I've been abstinent
for you for three years.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,080
Do you know how much I missed you?

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,160
Tonight,

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,280
I need to feel your breath,

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
feel your warmth,

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
and feel every inch of your skin.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm telling you.

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Tonight belongs to the two of us.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
It's our night of love.

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,440
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Chengjun.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm having my period.

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,520
Who are you lying to?

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't be shy.

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
I will be very gentle.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,840
(What should I do?)

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,800
(If I resist,)

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
(it will expose the fact
that I'm pretending to have amnesia.)

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,640
Yan.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Don't do this.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Let go of me.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,920
I didn't expect this side of you.

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
I like it.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
Let go of me.

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
Ma Chengjun.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
Let go of me.

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,520
Help!

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,360
Xiao Mo, how dare you hit me?

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,840
I will call the police.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I'm accusing you
of intentionally harming me.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,920
Are you okay?

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,360
Xiao Mo.

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm talking to you.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,960
You stupid bodyguard,
how dare you ignore me!

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,760
I can tell my girlfriend
to fire you now.

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,560
Xiao Mo is my bodyguard.

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,040
He's just protecting me.

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
Yan, why are you still defending him?

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Xiao Mo,

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,320
Lin Yan is my girlfriend.

65
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,000
I can do whatever I want to her.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,960
Xiao Mo,

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,320
that's enough.

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm tired, I'm going to sleep.

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,560
Don't make a problem. I'm warning you.

70
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Ma Chengjun.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,040
I'm warning you too.

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,160
If you dare to do anything
to Lin Yan again,

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
you will have a hard time.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,280
Don't think I'm not aware
of your intentions towards Lin Yan.

75
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,080
That's right.

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
I like Lin Yan.

77
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,240
Shameless.

78
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
You're just a bodyguard.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,040
You're trying to reach
for something beyond your grasp.

80
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,280
I...

81
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,040
Tomorrow...

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,720
I will tell Lin Yan what you want.

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,880
You wait.

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
You wait for it.

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,800
(Lin Yan is my girlfriend.)

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,600
Let go of me.

87
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
(I can do whatever...)

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Ma Chengjun.

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,440
(I want to her.)

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,960
Let go!

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is for you.

92
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,400
You have to wear this alarm

93
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,320
on your hand 24/7.

94
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,360
I had this custom-made for you.

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,920
There's a microchip inside.

96
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,040
No matter where you are,

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,920
I'll show up immediately.

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,720
Are you okay?

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,040
So, it doesn't matter
if anyone kisses you?

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,480
Yes, it doesn't matter.

101
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,400
What are you doing here?

102
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,720
Protecting you.

103
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,960
Am I not your personal bodyguard?

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,000
From now on,

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
I won't let anyone enter your room
as they please.

106
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Nobody can force you

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,880
or harm you.

108
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,240
What about you?

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560
This afternoon...

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
I went against your wishes.

112
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,360
But...

113
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
But what?

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,480
I will wait until the day
you are willing to.

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,880
I have something important
to discuss with you.

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
What is it?

117
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,640
Lately, Ma Chengjun
has been pushing me harder.

118
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,760
But I can't confront him directly.

119
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,280
So I was thinking,

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,520
maybe you can pretend to pursue me.

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,040
Maybe you can help me fend him off.

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,520
You want me to pretend to pursue you?

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,360
Right.

124
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Just pretend to pursue you?

125
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right.

Fine.

134
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
Since it's an act,

135
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,920
let's make it more convincing.

136
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,440
You'd better not regret it later.

137
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
Yan.

138
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,960
Sorry, I was wrong.

139
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,480
I was too impulsive yesterday.

140
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,960
But it was because I missed you so much.

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,200
Since you woke up,

142
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,960
We haven't had intimate contact yet.

143
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,920
It was my fault for being too impatient.

144
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,440
But...

145
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,440
Yan, I was wrong yesterday.

146
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
Xiao Mo was even more out of line.

147
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,560
I knew his intention.

148
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,400
He's plotting against you.

149
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,560
Yan,

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,160
Xiao Mo is just a rat.

151
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,760
He wants the Lin family's assets.

152
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,480
So, he wants to take you away from me.

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,360
Can you stop being paranoid every day?

154
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,120
Instead of doing your job,

155
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,760
you're just looking for trouble.

156
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,600
You must believe me.
He admitted it himself.

157
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,120
He has ulterior motives.

158
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,760
So you must drive him away immediately.

159
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,640
But if I fire him, who will protect me?

160
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,840
You know I've been harassed
by others before.

161
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,440
You don't care about me at all.

162
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
