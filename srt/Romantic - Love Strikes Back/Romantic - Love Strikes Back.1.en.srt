What's wrong with all of you?

29
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,400
Didn't you see the dirt on her dress?

30
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm so sorry.

31
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,560
It's probably happened
while filming outside.

32
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,280
Lili, you're here.

33
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,400
I thought you weren't going
to make it today.

34
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,480
I have to be here.

35
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
You're my best friend.

36
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,320
So nice of you.

37
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,200
You still call yourself her fiance?

38
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,760
You didn't even notice
there was something on her dress.

39
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,520
Sorry.

40
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
You have to take good care of her.

41
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,640
If you mess with her,

42
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,800
I won't let you off the hook.

43
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,120
Let's wrap up the rehearsal here.

44
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,680
The wedding will be started at 7 PM.

45
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,040
Wait. Please take a picture
of the three of us.

46
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,240
Yes, eyes on the camera.

47
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,560
Come on.

48
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,920
Get ready.

49
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,320
Okay.

50
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,920
Stand closer.

51
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Eyes on camera.

52
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Okay, one more time.

53
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,200
(Dad, I'm getting married.)

54
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,280
(You were wrong about him.)

55
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,920
(Chengjun is not who you thought he is.)

56
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,960
(He's nice to me and a great man.)

57
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,240
(He helps me manage the company well.)

58
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,560
(Dad, don't worry.)

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
(I will become
the happiest woman in the world.)

60
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,760
Wen Lili,

61
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
can you please stop
with the sneaky stuff from now on?

62
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
What's wrong?

63
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,760
You don't like it?

64
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,520
Yes, I don't like it.

65
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,560
What if Lin Yan finds out?

66
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,560
If so, all my hard work
for all these years

67
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,040
will be for nothing.

68
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,720
But, the riskier it gets,

69
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,840
the more thrilling it becomes.

70
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,040
(Darling, I have a gift for you.)

71
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
(There's a gift box
on the makeup room table.)

72
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,160
(Open it and take a look.)

73
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,800
Lili.

74
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,760
Lili.

75
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,520
Yan, why are you here?

76
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
Yan, listen to me.

77
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,440
Yan, please, just listen to me. Yan!

78
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,480
Please.

79
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,280
It was not how it looked.

80
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,160
What were you doing then?

81
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,080
Chengjun,

82
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,280
I've been nothing but nice to you!

83
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I gave you everything!

84
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
Why did you betray me?

85
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I was wrong, but you have to trust me.

86
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,560
Yan, please don't misunderstand.

87
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,280
There's nothing between Chengjun and me.

88
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,560
What are you doing here?

89
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Give me back my ring.

90
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,400
What are you doing?

91
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:34,880
Yan.

92
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,040
Give it back!

93
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,960
Please calm down, Yan!

94
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,680
Give it back!

95
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,080
Lin Yan, are you out of your mind?

96
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
