Li!

10

What are you doing?

11
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,920
Let me down.

12
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,520
Who is that girl?

13
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
There was only one crazy
female celebrity

14
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
who was pursuing Brother Xiao.

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,760
You also said that

16
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,680
it's one-sided love.

17
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,600
Brother Xiao never paid her
any attention.

18
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,400
I think

19
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
she is our real sister-in-law.

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,160
Yes.

21
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
Let me down.

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800

Do you want to repay
kindness with hatred?

25
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,400
I saved you last night.

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,200
Do you remember now?

27
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,120
Put on your slipper. The floor is cold.

28
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,400
Who asked you to bring me here?

29
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
You were pretty drunk last night.

30
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
I could not send you home.

31
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,480
Or would you rather
I take you to a hotel?

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,160
You…

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,160
Never mind.

34
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
I forgave you already.

35
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,280
Aren't you curious about

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,520
how you changed your clothes?

37
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
I don't want to know.

38
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
Is this your company?

39
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, this is my company.

40
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,800
You guys aren't from
the mafia, aren't you?

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,320
Your imagination is too wild.

42
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,560
This is an international security
advisors company.

43
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,240
A legitimate business.

44
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
What happened yesterday
was not an accident.

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,880
Since I woke up, I feel

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,280
like someone has been trying to hurt me.

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
So, I need somebody to help me.

48
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
But now, there is no one I can trust

49
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
inside the company.

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
Do you want me to help you?

51
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Yes.

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,040
You trust me now?

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
You've saved me twice,

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
so I assume you don't have
any ill intentions.

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm willing to take a chance.

56
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,280
Let's renegotiate the deal

57
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,040
we discussed earlier.

58
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,760
How do you want to negotiate?

59
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,120
At this moment,
I cannot offer you anything

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,080
as I'm only an empty shell chairwoman.

61
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,520
But,

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
I can give you

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,240
15% shares of Lin's Corporation
once all done.

64
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
What makes you think
I'd agree to that?

65
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,320
This is so different
from what I thought before.

66
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
This is the biggest offer I can make.

67
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,520
I still have one condition.

68
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,200
How you helped my Dad before,

69
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,800
that's how you should help me now.

70
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,840
I was President Lin's assistant
and personal bodyguard.

71
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
So, what you're saying is

72
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,200
you also want me to be

73
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
your 24/7 personal bodyguard?

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,880
Is that so?

75
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,480
Xiao Mo, what do you mean by this?

76
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,640
Apologize.

77
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
I just want to be
my sweetheart's bodyguard.

78
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,240
So romantic.

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,760
So cheesy.

80
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,880
So, does that mean it doesn't matter
if anyone kisses you?

81
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes, it doesn't matter.

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,160
What are you doing, Xiao Mo?

83
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,920
You're just the assistant I hired.

84
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,360
You have no right to interfere
in my personal affairs.

85
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,520
I'm warning you.

86
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,960
If you can't control your emotions
and offend me again like this,

87
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,040
you can just leave.

88
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,760
It's so beautiful.

89
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,160
They really are a match made in heaven.

90
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,280
Which part do they match?

91
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,120
They're just a match.

92
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,560
Open your eyes wide and see clearly.

93
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm the fiancée.

94
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,080
He's just a bodyguard.

95
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,400
You're just her fiancée, right?

96
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,040
As long as Miss Lin isn't married,

97
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,480
any man in the world

98
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,000
has the right to pursue her,

99
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
including me.

100
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
You're dreaming.

101
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160
From now on,

102
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm officially pursuing Lin Yan.

103
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Yan,

104
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,800
you can tell him.

105
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,040
Between the two of us, who do you like?

106
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,400
Who do you choose
between Xiao Mo and me?

107
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,760

to go to the hospital?

are even more severe.

It hurts.

134
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,400
Were you keep following me?

135
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,520
I'm your personal bodyguard.

136
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,160

Are you trying to thank me?

142
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,720
Since when nodding
is a way to express gratitude?

143
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,880
Thank you.

144
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,320
Only saying thank you

145
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,480
seems insincere, doesn't it?

146
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,280
Then,

Don't think I don't know
what you're thinking.

153
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,120
So, what do you think I'm thinking?

154
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,400

What do you mean by never mind?

157
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,600
What do you mean by sighing?

158
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,680
I am thinking whether the nutritious meal
I made for you

159
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,080
is not nutritional.

160
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,640
You are funny.

161
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,600

By the way,

165
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,720
I have a question for you.

166
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,680
You said before that I acted

167
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,400
and want to keep
a proper distance from me.

168
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,960
What is the appropriate distance?

169
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,200
Like this?

170
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,040
Like this?

171
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
Or like this?

172
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,600
It's really too much.

Last night,

253
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,400
you were quite enthusiastic.

254
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,560
You shut up.

255
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,360
Shut up.

256
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,320
Let me think.

257
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,640
Who made the first move

258
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,800
last night?

259
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,400
That's because...

260
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,400
you seduced me.

261
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,760
I still prefer the you from last night.

262
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,880
I said stop talking about it.

263
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,400
What's the matter?
I haven't even gotten out of bed yet.

264
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,400
Where are you going?

265
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,680
Xiao, who's in your room?

266
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,040
Who are you talking to?

267
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,920
My

268
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,480
pet.

269
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,440
Tell me who your pet is.

270
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,600
You.

271
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,640
I heard it.

272
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
It's sister-in-law.

273
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,520
Xiao,

274
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
when did you two get together?

275
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
Who is his sister-in-law?

276
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,400
You better hang up the phone.

277
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,800
Did you hear that?

278
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,040
Your sister-in-law is upset.

279
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,080
I have to go cheer her up.

280
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Xiao Mo, what nonsense
are you talking about?

281
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm not talking nonsense.

282
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,560
I'm stating the facts.

283
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,480
Just wait.

284
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,720
These eyelashes are longer than mine.

285
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,840
The skin is still so good.

286
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,200
Who is he?

287
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,000
He looks even better than a girl.

288
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,480
How did I miss

289
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,440
noticing you before?

290
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,520
What have

291
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,720
you been through?

292
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200

293
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,600
When

294
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,880
did you wake up?

295
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,440
Probably

296
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,760
before you woke up.

297
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
Did you hear

298
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,120
everything I just said?

299
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,280
Do you like me that much?

300
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,520
I'm very happy.

301
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,920
Are the rumors they said true?

302
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,080
What rumors?

303
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,280
They said

304
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,920
rumors about you.

305
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,040
When I joined the army,

306
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,840
there was a battle.

307
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,120
My comrades

308
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,600
were all trapped
in an abandoned village.

309
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,520
I went alone to save them.

310
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,440
The battle was brutal.

311
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,520

312
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,600

315
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,920

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,440
(I don't love you.)

374
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,800
(Leave now.)

375
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,120
(The best things come)

376
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,560
(when you least expect them to.)

377
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,920
(Never frown,)

378
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,360
(even when you are sad,)

379
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,160
(because you never know)

380
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,320
(who is falling in love with your smile.)

381
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,760
(To the world,)

382
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,720
(you may be one person.)

383
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
(But to one person,)

384
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,560
(you may be the world.)
