[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 14]

2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,240
Do you really want to marry Ma Chengjun?

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,640
You were also there just now.

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,920
I was afraid if I refused him,

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
he would be angry out of embarrassment

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,400
and leave Lin Corporation.

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,160
You can't bear to let him go?

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
You clearly know I didn't mean that.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm just afraid that if he leaves,

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,120
I cannot get

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,840
the money he took from Lin Corporation.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,400
Have you ever thought

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
that if you cannot find the money

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,680
within this month,

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,360
you...

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,320
You'll have to register
for marriage with him.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
Then, you will become
husband and wife legally.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,320
At that time,

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
if he wants
to get his rights as a husband,

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
how will you reject him?

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,440
I'll play it by ear.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
In any case,

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
my father put his whole life
in Lin Corporation.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,960
I will not let Ma Chengjun take it away.

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,160
If your father is still alive,

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,480
he definitely doesn't want to see

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,720
his daughter give up
her happiness for Lin Corporation.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,880
Mr. Ma, what's your plan
for the wedding?

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,520
We must follow the highest standards.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,440
Make it grand and impressive.

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,960
We must have the best venue,

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
wedding conductor, and wedding gown.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,880
No problem.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,160
When people speak of wedding,

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,440
I want them to think of ours,

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,520
saying "My wish

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,080
is to have a wedding like Lin Yan's".

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,720
Sounds fantastic.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,600
You may leave.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,400
Yes.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Mr. Ma, what do you want to do?

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,920
Have you considered

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
what I mentioned before?

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
I know your family situation.

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
There's a chance
for your mom to recover.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,440
But it needs a lot of money.

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,240
I'm worried about you

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
and I want to help you.

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
Ru,

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
get in, I'll drive you.

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,360
No need, Mr. Ma.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
What's the rush?

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
Don't you want to work tomorrow?

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Ru,

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,560
you just came to the company
as the receptionist.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
How come you're hanging out
with Ma Chengjun?

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,160
Ms. Lin, it wasn't me.

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,160
It was Mr. Ma who...

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
He harassed you?

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,840
Why haven't you thought
of asking the company for help?

61
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,920
It's useless.

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,680
How can I fight him?

63
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,760
He will fire me.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,480
Moreover, I'm not highly educated.

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
It's not easy for me to get a job.

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,080
My mother has cancer

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,120
and I have to pay
medical bills every month.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,960
I cannot afford to lose this job.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,560
Ma Chengjun, this bastard.

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,680
Ru,

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,040
do you believe me?

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,880
Then, are you willing to help me?

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
To be more precise,

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,480
it would also help you.

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
It's not good if other people see it.

76
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
They all went eating,
no need to be afraid.

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,800
Why are you so cooperative today?

78
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,160
You've figured things out?

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,240
Fool, I was testing you before.

80
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,760
Chengjun,

81
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,440
you and Ms. Lin being together,

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,800
I cannot say anything.

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,560
But that Wen Lili...

84
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, I'm not happy about that.

85
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,000
I want you to promise me

86
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
that you will not meet her again.

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,360
Don't talk about meeting her,

88
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
just thinking about her
gives me a headache.

89
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,160
Lili.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,120
Stealing my man and making mischief.

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
I'll beat you to death.

92
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
Chengjun, help me.

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,200
Lili, you...

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,440
We're in the office,
can't you control yourself?

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,560
Ma Chengjun, what do you mean?

96
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,080
You're speaking up for her, aren't you?

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,840
Help her.

98
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,480
You scum, I will give you a lesson.

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
Learning to be a seductress.

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
Your mother gave birth
to you for nothing.

101
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,720
How dare you scold me?

102
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
Do you dare to hit me?

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,640
So what, you stupid?

104
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,760
Both of you, don't fight.

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,680
Stop, both of you.

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,640
You crazy, how dare you hit me?

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,840
You scold me?

108
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,480
You crazy.

109
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,840
You scold me?

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Go away.

111
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
You scold me?

112
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,240
All of you...

113
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,920
You crazy.

114
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,160
What are you looking at?

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,720
Just a little misunderstanding
between colleagues.

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,480
Stop looking, dismiss.

117
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,960
Yan.

118
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,160
Chengjun,

119
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,360
what is happening here?

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,200
I was wrong,

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
but you have to trust me.

122
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,160
This woman and I were just having fun.

123
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,600
Chengjun, that's not what you said before.

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
You said you will
take care of me forever.

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
Nonsense, please don't believe her.

126
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,000
She didn't even talk to me
a few days ago.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,400
She suddenly
became very proactive today.

128
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,480
Nope, I don't have
any relationship with her.

129
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,840
Anyway,

130
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
if I lie, I will suffer damnation.

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm not...

132
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
Don't swear casually.

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,400
God is watching.

134
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,400
So, you still love me, right?

135
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,200
[Chairman]
Yan, I swear today.

136
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
From now on,

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,240
I will not care about

138
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
any woman other than you.

139
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,080
Whoever the woman is,

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,040
I only hope that the woman

141
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,160
is not Lili, my best friend.

142
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,240
Ms. Lin,

143
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,720
Mr. Ma and Lili's relationship
is certainly not that simple.

144
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,120
Shut up.

145
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
Do you think it's not chaotic enough?

146
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,320
Believe me,

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,720
there's nothing between Wen Lili and me.

148
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Lin Yan, don't pretend anymore.

149
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,400
Didn't you know earlier

150
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,120
that I am in a relationship
with Ma Chengjun?

151
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
Wen Lili, what nonsense
are you talking about?

152
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Yan, please don't trust her.

153
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,080
Before you passed out,

154
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,400
every time he said
he was working overtime,

155
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,320
he was actually fooling around with me.

156
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,800
You've been in a coma for three years.

157
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
We've been living in your house,

158
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,960
sleeping in your bed, and having fun.

159
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
After you woke up,

160
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
he has still been sleeping in my bed

161
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
and complaining to me
about how unromantic you are.

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
You crazy woman,

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,320
what nonsense are you talking about?

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,760
Yan, don't trust her.

165
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,440
Lili,

166
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,440
why are you like this?

167
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,160
Am I not good to you?

168
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,560
Good to me?

169
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,040
You're just trying to show off

170
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
your kindness as Miss Lin.

171
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,200
If you really care about me,

172
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,760
why did you introduce me
to Lin Corporation

173
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,200
as a mere receptionist?

174
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,160
I'm just your foil.

175
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,400
When I met you,
your family had no money.

176
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,120
It was me who helped you.

177
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,000
When you were dumped
and tried to jump off a building,

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
it was me who saved you.

179
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,400
In order to get you out of the shadows,
I brought you here.

180
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,680
It seems that I opened the door
to my enemy.

181
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,000
Let me tell you, Lili.

182
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,640
The greatest evil
is not being ungrateful,

183
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,960
but repaying kindness with hatred.

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,160
Do you think you can get everything
by relying on your beauty?

185
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,160
Ma Chengjun only loves money,

186
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,480
he doesn't love you.

187
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,800
You guessed it right.

188
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,080
I remember everything.

189
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,600
This time, you've completely lost.

190
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,080
Lin Yan!

191
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,960
I don't want to see you again.

192
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,440
Yan.

193
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,840
Yan.

194
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
Ms. Lin,

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,080
my mother's surgery went well.

196
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,920
Thank you for arranging
a good doctor for her.

197
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Go back to your hometown
and accompany her to recuperate.

198
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,960
Mr. Zhao has already agreed.

199
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
Just check in at any time.

200
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,400
If you still want to come back and work,

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Lin Corporation will always welcome you.

202
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,400
Actually, the thing I will miss the most

203
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,680
when I left, besides you...

204
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
There's still...

205
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,360
Xiao Mo is a good man.

206
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,040
If he is still single

207
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,040
when I'm back later,

208
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
I will definitely pursue him.

209
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,040
Ms. Lin, you have to take the chance.

210
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
What were you just talking about?

211
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,240
Nothing.

212
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,600
I just think that a girl like Ru

213
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
should be treated fairly.

214
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
I have a question for you.

215
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,200
What's that?

216
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,080
How long have you known
about their affair?

217
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
You really have been
keeping an eye on Ma Chengjun.

218
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,240
What?

219
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,320
Are you jealous?

220
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,720
If your boyfriend
doesn't quarrel with you,

221
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
and doesn't feel jealous,

222
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,720
then he must not love you.

223
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,120
Stop flattering yourself.

224
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,000
Who said you could be my boyfriend?

225
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,760
How about doing an internship
to make sure?

226
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,960
Full-time bodyguard.

227
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,560
Boyfriend intern.

228
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,520
You decide.

229
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,520
Then, what can I say?

230
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,360
Yan,

231
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,640
I admit

232
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,720
that I cheated.

233
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm a scum,

234
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,200
but you can't blame me entirely.

235
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,440
There are too many temptations

236
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,720
for a successful man like me.

237
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,800
It's just like the queen bee in flowers
with the most nectar.

238
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,200
The bees and butterflies
are all around me.

239
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,240
I can stop one,

240
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,640
but I cannot stop all of them.

241
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,160
You're really a scum.

242
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Someone is not a scum.

243
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,440
Besides not being a scum,

244
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,800
he doesn't have any other strengths

245
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,680
and only knows
how to fight and kill brutally.

246
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,480
When you aren't feeling well,

247
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,800
he'd just tell you
to drink more hot water.

248
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
You won't be happy
with this kind of man.

249
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Chengjun,

250
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't blame you,

251
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,600
but we have to postpone

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,920
our wedding.

253
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,120
Please don't, Yan.

254
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,840
I swear

255
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,200
that I

256
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
only belong to you.

257
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,720
Chengjun, actually,
I can understand you.

258
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Human's feeling is not easy to control.

259
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,160
Moreover, you face so many temptations.

260
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,720
It's inevitable to get distracted.

261
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,880
In fact, I face many temptations too.

262
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,400
You...

263
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,200
Has something happened?

264
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,360
What does it mean?

265
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
A person's heart is so big.

266
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,200
Does it only have space for one person?

267
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,880
Yan,

268
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,360
you don't actually have feelings
for Xiao Mo, right?

269
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,560
Yan,

270
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,520
don't go.

271
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,240
I haven't finished yet, Yan.

272
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,520
Get off.

273
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,200
She needs to take a rest.

274
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,160
We just had a little
disagreement between us.

275
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,000
To beat is to care,
to scold is to love okay?

276
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Did she hit you?

277
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,400
Did she scold you?

278
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
She just doesn't want to see you.
