00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,720
Xiao Mo,

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,400
you just overdone it.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,640
Don't forget why I asked you
to put on an act with me.

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,560
I've told you

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,960
if you want me to act with you,

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,080
then we need to make it convincing.

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,800
How's my acting?

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,960
I'll have to ask you to leave

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,320
if you behave like this again.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,200
Also,

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,920
don't you want the shares
that I promised you before?

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,520
What I truly wanted
has never been shares.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,320
What I want...

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,480
I want to walk around alone.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
I'll go back by myself.

So, it doesn't matter

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
Yes, it doesn't matter.

From now on,

34

I won't let anyone enter your room
as they please.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,400
Nobody can force you

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,600
or harm you.

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,040
You asked me to put on an act with you.

38
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,280
Fine.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,600
Since it's an act,

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
let's make it more convincing.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,160
(You'd better not regret it later.)

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,080
(From now on,)

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,480

What do you want to do?

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,200
If you suddenly do this, I...

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm not ready yet.

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,600
Take off.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,080
Isn't this too bold?

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
Quick.

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Don't be like this.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,920
Take it off.

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
Your wound looks very serious.

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,760
Are you sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,560
No need.

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,640
Compared to this wound,

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,920
My heart hurts even more.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,840
It hurts.

68
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,960
Have you been following me just now?

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,080
I'm your personal bodyguard.

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Of course, I have to
protect you closely.

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,400
I...

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
Before...

73
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,520
Just now...

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,000
I...

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,240
Are you trying to thank me?

76
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,280
Since when did nodding become
a way to express gratitude?

77
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,440
Thank you.

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,880
Only saying thank you

79
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,040
seems insincere, doesn't it?

80
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,840
Then,

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,160
what else?

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,880
What else do you want?

83
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,720
What do you think?

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
What are you doing?
Don't ever think about it.

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,160
What am I thinking?

86
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,280
Don't think I don't know
what you're thinking.

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,680
So, what do you think I'm thinking?

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,960
You know what you're thinking about.

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
Never mind.

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,960
What do you mean by that?

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,160
What do you mean by sighing?

92
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,240
I am wondering whether
the nutritious meal I made for you

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,640
is not nutritional.

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
You are funny.

95
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,160
Where did you see signs of malnutrition?

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,280
What do you mean?

97
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,560
Do you think I have a bad figure?

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,680
By the way,

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,280
I have a question for you.

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
You said before that I overdone it.

101
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,960
And you wanted to keep
a proper distance from me.

102
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,520
What is the appropriate distance?

103
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,760
Like this?

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Like this?

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Or like this?

106
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,160
That's really over the line.

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,720
Lin Yan,

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
why did you close your eyes?

109
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,640
You're so embarrassed.

110
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,520
Yan, are you awake already?

111
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,560
That night, I was too anxious.

112
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,160
I shouldn't have forced you.

113
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,760
I'm a bastard.

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,400
I should die.

115
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,720
But, Xiao Mo, he...

116
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
He bullied me too much.

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Yan,

118
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,600
open the door.

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's have a good discussion.

120
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,760
Yan.

121
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,880
Stop knocking.

122
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,000
They've already checked out.

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,680
They?

124
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
When did they leave?

125
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,160
The couple left early in the morning.

126
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,280
Talking and laughing.

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,960
I think they were a perfect match.

128
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
That boy was tall and handsome.

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
I am her fiance.

130
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Auntie, you don't know anything.
Don't talk nonsense.

131
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,640
These days, the relationship
between young people is so complicated.

132
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,920
Crazy.

133
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,800
I'm so happy.

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,480
Let us celebrate it

135
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,840
with braised pork belly today.

136
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,360
How about you cook,
and I'll help you out in the kitchen?

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Do you want to eat braised pork?

138
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
Then, you can order takeout.

139
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,480
Cooking is not part of my job.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,520
After all,

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm just a bodyguard.

142
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,360
Cooking is not part of your job.

143
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,640
You don't have to do that much for me.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,960
Narrow-minded.

145
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,720
Xiao Mo is so petty.

146
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,960
What's wrong with it?

147
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,880
Without you, I cannot live well?

148
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Are you okay?

149
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,000
It hurts.

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,840
Was what you just did
intentional or accidental?

151
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
What if I did it intentionally?

152
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
What if I did it accidentally?

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
If you did it intentionally,

154
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,960
I would think you are very clever

155
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,280
that you can use
such a method to make me cook.

156
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Don't think too highly of yourself.

157
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,600
So, it was an accident.

158
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,840
It seems that I need
to re-plan my career.

159
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,880
After all,

160
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,200
I'm following a stupid boss.

161
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
Who is stupid?

162
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,280
Plate.

163
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,920
It smells good.

164
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,760
Wait a minute.

165
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,160
Take your time to eat.

166
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,280
I'll go upstairs.
