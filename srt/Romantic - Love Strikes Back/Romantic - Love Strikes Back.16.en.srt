[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 16]

2
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,640
Don't tell me

3
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
that you actually have feelings
for Lin Yan?

4
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,240
Don't forget who you are.

5
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
We've never been friends
with the Lin Corporation.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
Waiter!

7
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,880
Another glass, please.

8
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,760
I'm sorry, ma'am.

9
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,560
If your previous bill isn't settled,

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,880
you can't continue ordering.

11
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,160
What do you mean?

12
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
I told you to pour, so pour.

13
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
Let me pay for the drink.

14
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,840
I'll handle the bill
for this lady tonight.

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,920
What are you doing here?

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,680
I come to see you.

17
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,320
Did you come to see
how miserable my life is now?

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
I've lost everything.

19
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,560
So?

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Are you happy now?

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
I just want to know

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,360
why you treated me like that

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
when I treated you so well?

24
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Lin Yan,

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,880
you're the heiress.

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
You have everything.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
No matter how hard I try,

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,280
I can't be compared with you.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
What can you do?

30
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,000
You were born with a silver spoon, huh?

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,760
I hate you.

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,280
I've never considered you as my sister.

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,320
Why are you like this now?

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
Enough, Lin Yan.

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,920
You just want evidence

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,000
to incriminate Ma Chengjun, right?

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,320
I do have the evidence.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,920
But I'll never give it to you.

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
Just keep dreaming.

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,200
I didn't come here
to ask you for evidence.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
But

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,600
I hope you can start over.

43
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,600
Don't ruin your life

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,640
for a scum.

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,120
Lin Yan.

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,440
I'll give you the evidence you want.

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,000
Wen Lili

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
just handed over the evidence to you?

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,120
Whenever Ma Chengjun
shifted company funds,

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,680
he always asked Wen Lili to do it.

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,360
They used to have a good relationship,

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,680
so it was hard to turn Wen Lili.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,840
But, now they've completely fallen out.

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,920
Of course, I have to seize
this opportunity.

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,160
I feel like things aren't that simple.

56
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,640
But you're letting her
off the hook just like that.

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,440
Have you gone soft?

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
That's just conciliation

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
to win her trust.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Or, how could I get the evidence?

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,280
I think you're clearly soft-hearted.

62
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,560
You're in denial.

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,840
I wonder if Wen Lili

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
is worth giving her another chance.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,480
The evidence provided by Wen Lili

66
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,200
has been organized

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
on this USB drive.

68
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,760
Notify the Board of Directors to come
for an important meeting tomorrow.

69
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
We're going to defeat Ma Chengjun

70
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,240
in one fell swoop.

71
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,960
Directors,

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
today, I have something to announce.

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
There are witness
and evidence indicating

74
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
that the former acting chairman,
Ma Chengjun

75
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
in the past three years

76
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,240
has repeatedly transferred
company assets,

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,640
causing significant losses
to Lin Corporation.

78
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
Mr. Ma,

79
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,320
do you have anything to say about this?

80
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,600
The witness you mentioned

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,280
is not her, is it?

82
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Ma Chengjun,

83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
Lin Yan came to see me.

84
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,280
I have a conversation record
with Lin Yan here.

85
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,200
Do you want it?

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
If you want it, come
to meet me with money.

87
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,360
Lin Yan, don't think
that your pretentious act

88
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,560
could move me.

89
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
Neither you nor Ma Chengjun
are good people.

90
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,840
I just hope to see
both of you fighting each other.

91
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,200
It will be best
if you both end up worse for wear.

92
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
(This is the greatest present for me)

93
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,680
(to start a new life.)

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,720
It's because
of Mr. Ma's previous affair.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,560
Lin Yan resents him.

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
So, she came to see me

97
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
and asked me to provide
a false testimony.

98
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,240
She claimed that Mr. Ma secretly
transferred company assets.

99
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
The evidence is fabricated.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,320
Everything was orchestrated by Lin Yan.

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Wen Lili,

102
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
I was going to give you one last chance.

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,280
I didn't expect you
to be so stubborn and unapologetic.

104
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,040
Even though the evidence
you provided was problematic,

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
within these half-truths
and half-lies,

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,120
I found genuine proof

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,480
of Ma Chengjun's asset transfers.

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,720
Here, all the transaction records

109
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,680
show that Ma Chengjun
used other companies

110
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,360
for fraudulent transactions.

111
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,840
On the surface,

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,360
it looks like Lin Corporation
was buying their services.

113
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,520
But in reality, they provided nothing.

114
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Ma Chengjun used this method

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
to siphon off
our company's substantial assets.

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,840
And every signature
on these transaction contracts

117
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,400
belongs to you,
Ma Chengjun.

118
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Lin Yan,

119
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,800
you were in a coma for three years.

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,320
For those three years,
I stood by you firmly.

121
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,760
For Lin Corporation,
I gave my all during those three years.

122
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,360
Even if you don't love me anymore,

123
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,480
and even if you fell for someone else,

124
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
how could you frame
and betray me like this?

125
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
Directors, please take a look.

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,760
Pay attention to all the signature dates
on each contract.

127
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,600
During that time,
I was abroad for an inspection tour.

128
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
It was impossible for me to sign those.

129
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,840
(Wait until you return
and sign these documents,)

130
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
(then we can transfer
the money to them.)

131
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,440
From now on, you'll sign
these contracts on my behalf.

132
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
Is that okay?

133
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,920
Of course.

134
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,680
You're the person I trust the most.

135
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,800
What's mine is yours.

136
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,080
In the future, the money will be ours.

137
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,160
Alright, I understand.

138
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,040
I have surveillance evidence to prove

139
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,760
that the one who forged signatures
and transferred assets

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,960
is Wen Lili.

141
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,080
We should report her
and have her arrested.

142
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,760
Ma Chengjun, you've played me.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,720
How could you do this to me?

144
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,720
Security!

145
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,560
Drag her out.

146
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,760
You must admit your mistake.

147
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,920
Ma Chengjun!

148
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
You just wait!
