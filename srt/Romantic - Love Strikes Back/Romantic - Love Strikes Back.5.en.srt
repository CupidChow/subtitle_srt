[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 5]

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,480
What are you doing?

3
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,520
Are you…

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,800
tired of living?

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,280
Who are you?

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,120
If you want to die, do it far away.

7
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,400
Isn't he Xiao…

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,920
Xiao what?

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,400
Just punch him.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
There is around one hundred
thousand yuan in this card.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,080
No password.

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,400
He is quite sensible.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,280
He starts begging

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,080
even before we start.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,000
Bro, it hurts.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,120
Those one hundred thousand yuan

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
are for medical expenses.

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Did you send people to bother Lin Yan?

19
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,360
Who are you?

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,960
What do you want?

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
You've already hurt her many times.

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
Are you tired of living?

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,200
What is your relationship with Lin Yan?

24
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,280
You don't need to know who I am.

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
You just need to know

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,000
that you should stay away from her.

27
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,800
I…

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
I did not do anything.

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Lin Yan is my best friend.

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
Really?

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,720
I warn you.

32
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,480
If you dare to bother Lin Yan again,

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,760
you will pay for that.

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,960
We have to be extra careful
when doing our mission.

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
No question when you
are not supposed to ask.

36
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
No words when you
are not supposed to say.

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,640
No eavesdropping when you
are not supposed to listen.

38
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,120
Do you understand?

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

40
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,480
Close your eyes.

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,760
Li!

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
What are you doing?

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
Let me down.

44
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,760
Who is that girl?

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,960
There was only a crazy female celebrity

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,440
who was pursuing Mr. Xiao.

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
You also said that

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
it was a one-sided love.

49
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,840
Mr. Xiao never paid her any attention.

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,640
I think

51
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
she is our real sister-in-law.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Yes.

53
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,080
Let me down.

54
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,040
What are you doing?

55
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,960
Let me go.

56
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,120
Do you want to repay
kindness with hatred?

57
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,640
I saved you last night.

58
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,440
Do you remember now?

59
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
Put on your slippers. The floor is cold.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,640
Who asked you to bring me here?

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
You were pretty drunk last night.

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,760
I could not send you home.

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
Or should I take you to a hotel?

64
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,400
You…

65
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,400
Never mind.

66
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
I've already forgiven you.

67
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,520
Aren't you curious

68
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,760
about how you changed your clothes?

69
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
I don't want to know.

70
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,400
Is this your company?

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,240
Yes, this is my company.

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,040
You guys aren't from the mafia, are you?

73
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,560
Your imagination is too wild.

74
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,800
This is an international
security consulting company.

75
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
A legitimate business.

76
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,240
What happened yesterday
was not an accident.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,120
Since I woke up, I've been feeling like

78
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
someone had been trying to harm me.

79
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,240
So, I need somebody to help me.

80
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
But now, there is no one I can trust

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,240
inside the company.

82
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,160
Do you want me to help you?

83
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,960
Yes.

84
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,280
You trust me now?

85
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,240
You've saved me twice,

86
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,880
so I assume you don't have
any ill intentions.

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm willing to take a chance.

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,520
Let's renegotiate the deal

89
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,280
we discussed earlier.

90
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm all ears.

91
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,360
At this moment,
I cannot offer you anything

92
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,320
as a chairwoman with no power.

93
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,760
But

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
I can give you

95
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,480
15% shares of Lin Corporation
once all done.

96
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
What makes you think
I'd agree to that?

97
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
It's so different
from what I thought before.

98
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,160
This is the best I can offer.

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,760
I still have one condition.

100
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,440
How you helped my dad before,

101
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,040
do the same for me now.

102
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,080
I was Mr. Lin's assistant
and personal bodyguard.

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,360
So, what you're saying

104
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
is you also want me

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,360
to be your 24/7 personal bodyguard?

106
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,120
Is that so?

107
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
Mr. Xiao, that female celebrity
came to see you again.

108
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,560
Xiao Mo, why didn't you answer my call?

109
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,400
Who is this woman?

110
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,000
Why is she wearing your shirt?

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Xiao Mo,

112
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,760
when are you going to agree

113
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,400
to be my personal bodyguard?

114
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,800
If you agree,

115
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,480
all the assets under my name,

116
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,400
including the company shares
will be yours.

117
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,360
Look,

118
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
I've brought
the equity transfer agreement.

119
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,880
Just sign it.

120
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,960
What I want is very simple.

121
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,400
I just want you
to be by my side every day

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,240
and take care of me personally.

123
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,760
Guess who's winning,
the female celebrity

124
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,240
or our sister-in-law?

125
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
Stupid, we've already
called her sister-in-law.

126
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,640
No need to guess anymore.

127
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,160
Just listen.

128
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,440
Miss Lin,

129
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,640
you also heard it.

130
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,400
How does it compare

131
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,680
to the conditions we discussed earlier?

132
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,400
Whatever she offered you,

133
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,120
I'll double it.

134
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,840
I will go with you
if you can promise me one thing

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
after everything's settled.

136
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,960
What is that?

137
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,240
I haven't thought about it yet.

138
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,840
Do you dare to promise me?

139
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes.

140
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Then you have to do me
one more small favor.

141
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,040
Okay.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Xiao Mo, what do you mean by this?

143
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,760
Sorry.

144
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,840
I just want to be
my sweetheart's bodyguard.

145
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,360
So romantic.

146
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,880
So cheesy.

147
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
(Even though I don't like Lin Yan,)

148
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,240
(I won't allow other men to cuckold me.)
