[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 6]

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
Stupid bodyguard.

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
How dare you hit me?

4
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,960
Stop it.

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,320
Stay away from me.

6
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,960
What are you doing?

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,560
Stop there.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,560
Stop.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm warning you.

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
It's lethal.

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,280
Stop it.

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,080
Does it hurt so much?

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,680
Do you want to go to the hospital?

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,680
No need.

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,880
Yan,

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
how come you are with Xiao Mo?

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,440
Chengjun,

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,080
I think you've changed.

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,880
You used to fully trust me.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,120
Now you don't even ask me,

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,840
but just directly blame me.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
You don't know who Xiao Mo is.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He's a murderer
who has killed people before.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,480
How dangerous it is for you
to keep him around.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,880
Do you know

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,200
that he saved me

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,640
when I encountered thugs before?

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,080
Is that true?

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
So every time I go out,

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,160
I always feel unsafe.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
Why didn't you tell me?

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,520
You're busy.

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't want you to worry about me.

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
I can help you find a bodyguard.

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,640
Then you won't need
that Xiao Mo anymore.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
He has ulterior motives for you.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,240
Do you have no trust in me

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,880
or in you?

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,240
I trust you.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,600
I don't trust him.

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,480
I think the most important thing
between a couple is trust.

42
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,040
Just like you and Lili.

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,240
You two spend the whole day together.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Have I ever suspected it?

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,480
That's different.

46
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,520
There is nothing going on between us.

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,160
I swear.

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
No need to swear.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,520
Of course, I believe you two.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,200
By the way,

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
how did you know we're here?

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,640
It's just

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,440
a coincidence.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,200
It's all your fault.

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,760
If you hadn't been causing trouble,

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
Lin Yan wouldn't have brought
Xiao Mo back.

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,800
You did more damage

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,880
than good.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,120
The relationship between Lin Yan
and Xiao Mo is definitely not simple.

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,480
Of course, I know it.

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,360
Who exactly is Xiao Mo?

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
He used to be Lin Yan's father's
special assistant and bodyguard.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,080
He looks like a decent person.

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,680
Graduated from a prestigious
university abroad.

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
In reality, he's just a thug.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
He's cruel and aggressive.

67
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,560
They said he joined
a mercenary army abroad

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,800
and slaughtered an entire village
in the Middle East.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
His hands were covered in blood.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,040
He's that frightening?

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,240
I don't know where he has been
in the past two years.

72
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,280
The problem is, he's always
been obsessed with Lin Yan.

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,040
It was not easy
to get him fired by Lin Yan.

74
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,200
But you've made it futile.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,600
Who knows what trouble

76
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,800
Xiao Mo would cause?

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,080
So annoying.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,280
Xiao Mo,

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
for Lin Yan's sake,

80
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,480
I can give you a chance.

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Welcome to Lin Corporation.

82
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,680
I'll have to bother Mr. Ma
to take care of me again.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Yan,

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,120
the directors are already
in the conference room.

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,440
Let's go.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,040
Sure.

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
You're just a bodyguard.

88
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
This is a high-level meeting.

89
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,040
You're not qualified to participate.

90
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
I'll be waiting for you at the door.

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,200
For this deal,

92
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,840
the amount of funds involved is huge.

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,960
It will seriously affect the future
of our Lin Corporation.

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,800
If Ms. Lin

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,240
can not reach an agreement
with Tengfei Company,

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
then I will act in the best interest
of the company.

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
I will represent the Board of Directors

98
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,320
and ask Ms. Lin

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
to step back from her position.

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Uncle,

101
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

102
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,840
Today's board meeting was called

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,280
because Tengfei Company had agreed

104
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,640
to sell the land to Lin Corporation.

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,480
But I refused it.

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,040
Because I found

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,680
something wrong with that piece of land.

108
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,000
There is a shrine
in the middle of that land.

109
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
The villagers firmly refused
to demolish it.

110
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,680
If we buy that land,

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,040
we won't be able
to build anything on it.

112
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,920
It's like throwing
Lin Corporation's billions

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,160
into the ocean.

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,120
This land has serious problems
and cannot be purchased.

115
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,240
Besides, I've always been curious

116
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,000
why does Tengfei Company
value Ma Chengjun so much?

117
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
After investigation,

118
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,640
I found that Tengfei's holding company
is a foreign company.

119
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,760
Behind this foreign company,

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,840
there is also
an offshore holding company.

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,480
The owner of this holding company is...

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
Ma Chengjun?

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,560
He bought a piece of waste land
at an extremely low price.

124
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,600
Then, he sold it to Lin Corporation
at a high price.

125
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,160
He pocketed the money for himself.

126
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,360
If you buy it,

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,080
you're giving your money away to him.

128
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
If you don't buy it,

129
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,440
he will find a reason to kick you
out of the Board.

130
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,640
This bastard.

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,520
Uncle,

132
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,760
didn't you notice

133
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,840
such a serious problem?

134
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,000
I...

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,480
I...

136
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,200
As the executive director
of the company,

137
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
you've made such a grave mistake.

138
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,960
According to the company's regulations,

139
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
you should be dismissed.

140
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,680
I...

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm not the one handling this deal.

142
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,080
Mr. Ma handled it.

143
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,800
My future nephew-in-law,

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,120
how could you be so careless?

145
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
Look at my niece.

146
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,400
She is so observant

147
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,560
with sharp eyes.

148
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,560
She spotted the problem in time.

149
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,280
Otherwise,

150
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,240
Lin Corporation will have to
handle the hot potato.

151
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,240
Is that right?

152
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,280
Forget it.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,960
After all, it didn't
cause any real losses.

154
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,800
But someone must be responsible

155
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
for this matter.

156
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,920
Dismiss me?

157
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,480
As Lin Yan said,

158
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,720
the Tengfei Company project
was introduced by you.

159
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,000
We need to fire you

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,920
so we can explain it
to the Board of Directors.

161
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,080
I did everything as you asked.

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,840
Yes, nothing was wrong.

163
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,760
But for the sake of our big plan,

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,560
you have to endure it.

165
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,320
Sometimes, you have to put up
with small things for a greater purpose.

166
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,960
Didn't you say

167
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,640
that you were working very hard
during this period?

168
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,920
Just take this opportunity

169
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,160
to take a long vacation for yourself.

170
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,960
Alright.

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Good girl.

172
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,240
You've disappointed me!

173
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
Chengjun!

174
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,440
How could you do this to Lili?

175
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
If it weren't for Yan this time,

176
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200
I wouldn't have spared you.

177
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,640
Lili,

178
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
is your face okay?

179
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,080
Lili,

180
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,320
don't be too angry with Chengjun.

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,440
It was all my decision.

182
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,480
Yan,

183
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
we are best friends.

184
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Can you reconsider it?

185
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,720
I know you're doing it
for the good of the company.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,640
But it was such a big mistake.

187
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,760
I can't explain it
to the Board of Directors.

188
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,720
Also,

189
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,840
because we are best friends,

190
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
I can't show any favoritism.

191
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,880
But I know

192
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,040
you're a good girl.

193
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,480
You won't be angry with me.

194
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,280
Is that right?

195
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,760
Feel free to contact me

196
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,680
if there's any problem in the future.

197
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,400
I'll have a meeting today.

198
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,680
I can't give you a ride.

199
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Chengjun,

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,560
don't be too angry with Lili anymore.

201
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
Help her pack up and drive her home.

202
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,160
Okay.

203
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
Get ready.

204
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,480
Starting today,

205
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
we officially welcome
our chairwoman, Lin Yan

206
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
back to Lin Corporation.

207
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,080
(Dad, have you seen it?)

208
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,440
(This is my first step in returning
to Lin Corporation)

209
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,840
(One day, I'll fully reclaim
Lin Corporation)

210
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,480
(and take back everything
that belongs to us.)
