[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 7]

2
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,200
Chengjun,

3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,160
Lin Yan is deliberately picking on me.

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,760
Why didn't you help me out?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,520
How did she find out the problem there?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,120
Chengjun,

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
can you just listen to me?

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,560
No, there was something wrong.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,040
Did she find out something?

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,160
What could she find out?

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
No.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,760
I need to marry her immediately

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
before she knows anything.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,760
Marry her?

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,560
Yeah.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,160
This way, I can at least
get half of the shares.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,600
More than I actually planned.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,560
How about me if you marry her?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,800
Lili,

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,800
do you know what I liked most
about you before?

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,720
It was you know your place.

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Three years ago,
you were just a receptionist.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
I personally promoted you
to be the chairman's assistant.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,280
What's wrong?

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,040
Have I been too good to you
these three years?

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,400
Alright.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm marrying her.

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,800
Isn't it also for us to be together

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,600
and for our future?

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,480
How about this?

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,480
I'll find a place,
and you can take a two-day break.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm sure you'd like that hotel.
How about it?

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
No.

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,080
There's no way for you to marry her.

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,160
Hello?

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,120
Hello, Chengjun. Where are you?

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm working overtime.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
I've already guessed
that you'd be working late.

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,160
Tough night, huh?

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
No, it's my responsibility.

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,800
For the Lin Corporation.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,600
I brought late-night snacks for you.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm on my way.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Wait for me, okay?

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,480
What?

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,040
What's wrong, Chengjun?

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,960
I think I just heard a woman's voice.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
I just hit my leg against a table.

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,040
Alright, I'll be there soon.
Be good, okay?

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,880
Waiting for you.

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,600
Where are my clothes?

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,920
Where are you going?

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,680
To work.

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,480
But you're not wearing your underwear.

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,760
Ma Chengjun used to tell me
he was working overtime with Wen Lili.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,240
I never suspected anything.

57
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,480
I didn't expect both of them
to be working in bed.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,840
Ma Chengjun is a tricky guy.

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,960
There must be more trouble later.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,040
This is for you.

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,240
What's this?

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
I can't accept this.

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,400
It's not up to you.

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
You have to wear this alarm

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,880
on your hand 24/7.

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,320
An alarm?

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,040
What do you think it is?

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,240
I had this custom-made for you.

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,680
How to use it?

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,240
Press here.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,320
There's a microchip inside

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,440
with GPS tracking.

73
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,960
No matter where you are,

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,960
I'll show up immediately.

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,560
Got it.

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Thanks.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,920
I've told you not to rush your recovery.

78
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,560
But I have to recover
as soon as possible

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
so that I can regain control
over Lin Corporation.

80
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,080
It's just a minor sprain,
nothing serious.

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,840
But still, you need to be cautious.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,920
Have you

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,240
really been in a combat,

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
killing people?

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,000
What do you think?

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
How did you get those gunshot wounds?

87
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
Have you ever seen 007?

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,240
Yes, I have.

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm 009.

90
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Eat up.

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,000
What is this stuff?
Why does it taste so bad?

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
This is porridge
made from crushed grains.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,840
It's specially prepared
for your recovery.

94
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I won't eat it.

95
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,440
It tastes terrible

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,440
and has no flavor at all.

97
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
It's sweet now.

98
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,880
Eat it.

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
It's too sweet.

100
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
It should be better now.

101
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,720
Cooking isn't a part of your job.

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
You don't have to do that much for me.

103
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,560
Don't worry.

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,840
You don't need to pay extra for these.

105
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,520
It's a complimentary service.

106
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
If you don't recover well,

107
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,440
my investment will fail.

108
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
Xiao Mo,

109
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
I understand what you're thinking.

110
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,200
But, I think we should maintain a purely

111
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,760
professional relationship.

112
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,840
Am I not doing so

113
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
or are you no longer doing so?

114
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

115
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,120
Take your time eating.

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
(Did she catch on
that I've started to like her?)

117
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,600
(Was I that obvious?)

118
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,760
Lin Yan,

119
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,840
you can't trust any man again.

120
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,360
Yan, why haven't you come over yet?

121
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,080
Chengjun,

122
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
I suddenly don't feel well.
I won't come for now.

123
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,200
What?

124
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
Hey!

125
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,160
Ma Chengjun.

126
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm not going.

127
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
You have to go.

128
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,120
You got no choice.

129
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm not going.

130
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,360
Ma Chengjun, I won't go.

131
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,680
Sir, drive the car.

132
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,720
Ma Chengjun transferred
most of the company's assets.

133
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,160
It looks perfectly legal
with no visible flaws.

134
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,320
So we can't confront him just yet.

135
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,920
We need more time

136
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,960
to make him return
all the assets he took out.

137
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,840
There's one more thing.

138
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,960
He sent Wen Lili
to go on vacation yesterday.

139
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,920
Lin Yan,

140
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,360
I want to talk to you privately.

141
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Yan,

142
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,640
come here.

143
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,920
Have a seat.

144
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,640
Yan,

145
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,160
do you still remember this photo?

146
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Three years ago,

147
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,800
if it weren't because of your accident,

148
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,360
we might have children
calling us "Mom" and "Dad" by now.

149
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,280
Every time I look at this picture,

150
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,160
it makes me sad.

151
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,080
Also, I've disappeared from your memory.

152
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,920
It's time to get our lost time back.

153
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,720
Yan,

154
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
I've checked the Chinese calendar.

155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,640
The third day of next month
is an auspicious day.

156
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,520
Marry me.

157
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,920
Chengjun,

158
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
do you still love me?

159
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,720
Do you even need to ask?
Of course, I do.

160
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,600
But, I haven't felt
the same way as before.

161
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,240
After all, I've been in a coma
for so long

162
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
and waking up to all of these changes.

163
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
I think it's time for us...

164
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,840
To break up?

165
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,400
Yan, please don't do this.

166
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,920
Have I done anything wrong?

167
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,960
You can talk to me.

168
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
What are you thinking?

169
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,120
How could I bear to leave you?

170
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,520
Then, what do you mean?

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I think it's time for us
to go on a vacation

172
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
to rekindle the feelings between us.

173
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
Alright.

174
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,640
I completely agree.

175
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,040
Leave the arrangements to me.

176
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,000
No need.

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,160
I'll take care of it this time.

178
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,560
As you wish.

179
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,800
Trust me. I'll plan everything properly.

180
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,040
This time,

181
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,440
you just need

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
to enjoy yourself.

183
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,040
[Wen Lili]
(Chengjun, I'm already at the hotel.)

184
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,360
[Wen Lili]
(I listened to you this time.)

185
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,040
[Wen Lili]
(You must compensate me well.)

186
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
