1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,320
You saved me yesterday.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,400
Yeah.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,360
Why were you at the hospital last night?

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
I happened to pass by.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,960
Happened to?

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,720
What's your relationship
with Ma Chengjun?

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,720
Don't you remember?

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,160
Back then, it was Ma Chengjun
who made you fire me.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,040
So, after you left Lin Corporation,

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,320
where did you go?

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,120
It doesn't matter anymore.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,280
Drink this first.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,280
No, thanks.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,880
I want to go home.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,360
Given your current condition,

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,720
what do you think you could do?

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,240
I can go see my Uncle.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,160
I can look
for my dad's old associates.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Ma Chengjun is
a completely different person now.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,440
You can't mess with him.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,960
And now, everyone in the company

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,560
is on Ma Chengjun's side.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,640
In reality, you're already homeless.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,720
Ma Chengjun and Wen Lili

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,960
are living in your house,

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,640
and spending your money.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Even if you regain control
of the company,

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,640
it won't matter.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,560
Ma Chengjun has already transferred
most of the company's assets.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,440
Lin Corporation is just an empty shell.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,880
Maybe I can help you.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,320
No need.

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,240
Just take me back to Lin Corporation.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,920
Why did you ask me here?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
You saw Ma Chengjun steal from
the Lin Corporation with your own eyes.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,840
What's your take on this?

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,360
This is my business.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
It's none of your concern.

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to make a deal with you.

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,000
What kind of deal?

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,760
I can help you reclaim
the Lin Corporation.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
But I have one condition.

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
After it's done,

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,640
I want half of your shares.

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,880
Half?

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
What makes you think
you can propose such a condition?

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,680
Because in this world,

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,040
only I can help you,

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,760
and I can ensure your safety as well.

50
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,400
Why should I trust you?

51
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,680
Where have you been all these years?

52
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,040
Why have you suddenly returned?

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
What's your agenda?

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160
Are you afraid?

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,440
If you want to know, I can tell you.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm not interested.

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,440
If you're simply after money,

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
considering you helped me last time,
I can provide that.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,520
What do you want with
the Lin Corporation's shares?

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,280
You don't need to worry
about these things.

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,440
You're not trying to seek revenge

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,280
because I fired you back then, are you?

63
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
If your father were still alive,

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Don't bring up my father.

66
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,560
You're no longer his special assistant.

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,880
I don't need your help.

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,560
I can handle it myself.

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,760
What are you doing?

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,800
Are you…

71
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,080
tired of living?

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
Who are you?

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,400
If you want to die, do it far away.

74
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,680
Isn't he Xiao…

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,200
Xiao what?

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,680
Just finish him.

77
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
There is around one hundred
thousand yuan in this card.

78
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,360
No password.

79
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
He is quite interesting.

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,560
He starts begging even before

81
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,360
the beating starts.

82
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,280
Bro, it hurts.

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,400
Those one hundred thousand yuan

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
are for medical expenses.

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Did you send people to bother Lin Yan?

86
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,640
Who are you?

87
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,240
What do you want to do?

88
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
You've already hurt her many times.

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,560
Are you tired of living?

90
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,480
What is your relationship with Lin Yan?

91
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,560
You don't need to know who I am.

92
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,040
You just need to know

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,280
that you cannot touch Lin Yan.

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,080
I…

95
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
I did not do anything.

96
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,960
Lin Yan is my best sister.

97
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,440
Really?

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,000
I warn you.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,760
If you dare to bother Lin Yan again,

100
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,040
it will not be as simple as today.

101
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,560
Close your eyes.

102
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
Li!

103
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
What are you doing?

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,240
Let me down.

105
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,840
Who is that girl?

106
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
There was only one crazy
female celebrity

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
who was pursuing Brother Xiao.

108
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,080
You also said that

109
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,000
it's one-sided love.

110
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,920
Brother Xiao never paid her
any attention.

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
I think

112
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
she is our real sister-in-law.

113
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,480
Yes.

114
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,160
Let me down.

115
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,120
What are you doing?

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,040
Let me go.

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,200
Do you want to repay
kindness with hatred?

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,720
I saved you last night.

119
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,520
Do you remember now?

120
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,440
Put on your slipper. The floor is cold.

121
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,720
Who asked you to bring me here?

122
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
You were pretty drunk last night.

123
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
I could not send you home.

124
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,800
Or would you rather
I take you to a hotel?

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,480
You…

126
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,480
Never mind.

127
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,680
I forgave you already.

128
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,600
Aren't you curious about

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,840
how you changed your clothes?

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
I don't want to know.

131
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,480
Is this your company?

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,320
Yes, this is my company.

133
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,120
You guys aren't from
the mafia, aren't you?

134
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,640
Your imagination is too wild.

135
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,880
This is an international security
advisors company.

136
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,560
A legitimate business.

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,320
What happened yesterday
was not an accident.

138
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,200
Since I woke up, I feel

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
like someone has been trying to hurt me.

140
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
So, I need somebody to help me.

141
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,640
But now, there is no one I can trust

142
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,320
inside the company.

143
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,240
Do you want me to help you?

144
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes.

145
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,360
You trust me now?

146
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,320
You've saved me twice,

147
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,960
so I assume you don't have
any ill intentions.

148
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,520
I'm willing to take a chance.

149
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,600
Let's renegotiate the deal

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,360
we discussed earlier.

151
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,080
How do you want to negotiate?

152
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
At this moment,
I cannot offer you anything

153
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
as I'm only an empty shell chairwoman.

154
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,840
But,

155
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,680
I can give you

156
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,560
15% shares of Lin's Corporation
once all done.

157
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,680
What makes you think
I'd agree to that?

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,640
This is so different
from what I thought before.

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,240
This is the biggest offer I can make.

160
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,840
I still have one condition.

161
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,520
How you helped my Dad before,

162
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
that's how you should help me now.

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,160
I was President Lin's assistant
and personal bodyguard.

164
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,440
So, what you're saying is

165
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,520
you also want me to be

166
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
your 24/7 personal bodyguard?

167
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Is that so?

168
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,880
Xiao Mo,

169
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,960
for Lin Yan's sake,

170
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,080
I can give you a chance.

171
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,840
Welcome to Lin Corporation.

172
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,360
What are you doing here?

173
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
Protecting you.

174
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,920
Am I not your personal bodyguard?

175
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,960
From now on,

176
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,360
I won't let anyone
enter your room casually.

177
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,560
Forcing you

178
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,840
or harm you.

179
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,200
What about you?

180
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,520
This afternoon...

181
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
I went against your wishes.

183
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,320
But...

184
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
But what?

185
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,440
I will wait until the day
you are willing to.

186
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,840
I have something important
to talk to you about.

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,760
What is it?

188
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,600
Ma Chengjun has been pushing

When I was young,

351
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,640
my dad gave me a book
called "Stray Birds" by Tagore.

352
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
There is a sentence in it
that I really like.

353
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,040
"Stray birds of summer

354
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,240
come to my window to sing

355
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,760
and fly away.

356
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
And yellow leaves of autumn,

357
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,360
which have no songs,

358
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,920
flutter and fall there with a sign."

359
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,320
I really regret it.

360
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
When Dad was still alive,

361
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,360
I always made him angry,

362
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,200
didn't spend enough time with him,

363
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
didn't cherish him.

364
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,360
But the beauty of the world
is like this shooting star,

365
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,520
gone in an instant,

366
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,200
and never going back.

367
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,560
Tagore also said

368
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,560
"If you shed tears
when you miss the sun,

369
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,640
you also miss the stars".

370
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,560
He won't blame you.

371
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,160
He'll watch over you

372
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,760
like the stars in the sky.

373
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,640
He just changed his approach.

374
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,080
If you miss your dad,

375
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
just look up at the stars.

376
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,600
He definitely wants you to be happy.

377
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
Are there any shooting stars?

378
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,960
I have a lot of things to say to my dad.

379
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,160
Do you want to watch a meteor shower?

380
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,280
I'll take you there.

381
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,360
Why are you bringing me here?

382
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,800
You'll know in a moment.

383
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,760
Gather.

384
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,040
Standing at attention.

385
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,440
- Hi, Mr. Xiao.
- Hi, Mr. Xiao.

386
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,600
- Hi, Sister-in-law.
- Hi, Sister-in-law.

387
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,800
Mr. Xiao,

388
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,640
everything is ready.

389
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,360
Let's get started.

390
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,120
Standing at attention.

391
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,440
Turn back.

392
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,600
Is this the meteor shower
you're talking about?

393
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,400
Do you like it?

394
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,160
Yes.

395
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,680
As long as it's what you want,

396
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,320
no matter what it is,

397
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
I will try my best to do it.

398
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,600
Dad.

399
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
I will work hard to be happy

400
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,760
and take good care of myself.

401
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,520
Dad, I will always miss you.

402
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Lin Yan.

403
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,400
I have some particularly important things
to tell you.

404
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,480
Why are you suddenly so serious?

405
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,240
Xiao Mo,

406
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,600
28 years old this year.

407
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Joining the military after graduating
from a foreign university.

408
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,800
After retiring from the special forces,
he joined the merceries army.

409
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,520
After returning home,
he became a special assistant

410
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,400
of Chairman Lin by mistake.

411
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,920
From then on,

412
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,600
he had a new goal in his life.

413
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
Because from the moment
he entered the company,

414
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,960
he was deeply fascinated by a girl.

415
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
At first, she turned a blind eye to him.

416
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,400
Until one day,

417
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,520
he had the opportunity
to stand in front of her again.

418
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,960
This girl...

419
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,200
Look at here.

420
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,080

518
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,360
You're not dead yet?

519

Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.
Finally, you get Sister-in-law.

520
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,560
Congratulations.

521
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,720
Are you lying to me too?

522
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,320
I see, Xiao Mo.

523
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,240
Do you know how much I worry about you?

524
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
I'll be dead for real if you hit me again.

525
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,560
Sorry.

526
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,880
Are you okay?

527
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,840
It's just the rear-end collision.
The doctor said it's a minor injury.

528
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,520
I'm fine.

529
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,320
Then,

530
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,160
what did you sign just now?

531
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,280
Just now?

532
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,280
It was the signing
for Mr. Xiao's discharge from the hospital.

533
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,360
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

534
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Mr. Xiao is in good health.

535
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,760
Since you are in such good health,
I'll leave.

536
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,080
Where are you going?

537
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,800
I heard everything you've just said.

538
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,560
I just...

539
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,560
What did I say?

540
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,880
You said you love me.

541
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,880
I also love you.

542
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,840
Don't be stressed.

543
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,520
This is not a proposal.

544
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,680
It just means

545
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,240
that you are booked by me.

546
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,160
From now on,

547
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,720
you are Xiao Mo's woman.

548
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,600
Mr. Xiao, it turns out
that you are so good at dating.

549
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,520
Go.

550
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,920
Booked? So, it means

551
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,800
I can still change my mind?

552
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,880
I've stamped it.

553
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,080
Now, you don't have a chance
to change your mind.

554
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,880
It's shivering.

555
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,240
I can't see. I might get a stye tomorrow.

556
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,760
We'll go, Mr. Xiao.

557
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,280
Be gentle.

558
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,240
Close the door.

559
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,880
Yes.

560
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,320
Promise me.

561
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,680
No matter what difficulties
we encounter in the future,

562
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,880
let me stay by your side.

563
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,520
We'll face it together,

564
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,880
okay?

565
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Tell me.

566
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,880
Who are you really?

567
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,400
What's your purpose at Lin Corporation?

568
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,120
And what's your connection to Mingde?

569
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,520
I can't explain

570
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,360
all of these to you right now.

571
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,440
Did you know that Mingde supported

572
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,560
Ma Chengjun's acquisition
of Lin Corporation?

573
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,600
Why didn't you tell me?

574
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,760
I do have some connection with Mingde,

575
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,120
but I'd never do anything

576
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,200
to harm you or Lin Corporation.

577
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,840
And what's the reason
you stay close to me

578
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,160
and want Lin Corporation's shares?

579
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,440
That was just an excuse
I used to stay by your side.

580
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,560
What I've always wanted

581
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,160
is just you.

582
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,960
Ever since I was hurt
by Ma Chengjun and Wen Lili,

583
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,560
I stopped trusting anyone.

584
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,440
It was your presence that changed me.

585
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,480
You were the only person

586
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,040
I believed in in this world.

587
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,040
But now, I've realized

588
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,360
that you've been lying to me.

589
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,680
Lin Yan,

590
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,480
I know

591
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,280
that Lin Corporation means a lot to you.

592
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,280
I can't explain
this situation right now,

593
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,080
but I promise I will
when the time is right.

594
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,760
What do you mean by the right time?

595
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Maybe

596
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,960
I shouldn't have made you
my bodyguard in the first place.

597
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,080
I want to make a deal with you.

598
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,320
I can help you
reclaim the Lin Corporation.

599
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,720
(After it's done,)

600
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,640
I want half of your shares.

601
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,280
Why should I trust you?

602
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,000
Because in this world,

603
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,040
only I can help you,

604
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,120
(Where have you been all these years?)

605
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,560
(Why have you suddenly returned?)

606
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,360
(What's your purpose?)

607
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,360
(What do you want
Lin Corporation's shares for?)

608
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,760
(You don't need to worry about that.)

609
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,080
(After everything is settled,)

610
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,840
(I can give you)

611
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,320
(15% of Lin Corporation's shares.)

612
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,400
That's quite different
from what I had in mind before.

613
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,640
How you helped my dad before,

614
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,160
that's how you should help me now.

615
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,680
(I was Mr. Lin's assistant
and personal bodyguard.)

616
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,920
(So, are you meaning)

617
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,080
(that you also want me to be)

618
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,920
(your all day personal bodyguard?)

619
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,360
(We are only
in a professional relationship.)

620
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,800
(You're just my bodyguard.)

621
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,360
(You should know where you stand.)

622
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,000
(The shares I promised you,
you don't want them anymore?)

623
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,880
What I truly want has never been shares.

624
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,480
(I want to be your man,)

625
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,320
(to protect you.)

626
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,560
I've never said this to anyone before,

627
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,120
(and I won't say it)

628
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,720
(to another woman in my lifetime.)

629
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,280
(Lin Yan,)

630
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,920
(I like you.)

631
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,920
Leave.

632
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,360
Let's never see each other again.

633
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,840
Jun,

634
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,760
he has come.

635
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,240
Xiao Mo, you are the best.

636
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,120
Dare to come alone.

637
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,520
Where is Lin Yan?

638
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,720
Don't worry.

639
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,440
She's fine.

640
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,480
I have already transferred the money

641
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,600
you want to your account

642
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,840
according to your request.

643
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,800
I have also completed the procedures
for going abroad.

644
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,520
Indeed you are Mr. Xiao.

645
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,240
The efficiency
of handling affairs is high.

646
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,960
Where is Lin Yan?

647
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,680
In my heart.

648
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,640
I'm asking you where she is!

649
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,240
I just want to see you in panic.

650
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,400
I know you care about her

651
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,480
and can't let her go.

652
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,960
When I think of my woman

653
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,640
being with scumbags like you,

654
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,560
I can't bear it for a moment.

655
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,800
No need to endure it.

656
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,960
Go.

657
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,040
Fight him.

658
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,160
Xiao Mo!

659
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,960
Xiao Mo!

660
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,240
Ma Chengjun, you bastard.

661
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,080
Shut up.

662
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,840
Ma Chengjun.

663
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,840
Don't move.

664
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,800
Stay at your place, don't move.

665
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,440
Let go of her.

666
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,560
Let go of her?

667
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,720
That depends on how you behave.

668
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,160
What do you want?

669
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,760
I need so many things.

670
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,000
It all depends on what you're willing

671
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,640
to do for her.

672
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,400
I can give you everything you want.

673
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,640
Everything?

674
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,560
I want you to kneel down now.

675
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,360
Don't.

676
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,040
Don't listen to him.

677
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,200
Don't.

678
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,600
Xiao Mo, don't listen to him.

679
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,440
Don't listen to him.

680
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,520
Kneel down.

681
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,640
- Kneel.
- Hurry up, kneel down.

682
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
Xiao Mo, don't listen to him.

683
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,440
Kneel.

684
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,480
- Crawl.
-Hurry, crawl.

685
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,120
What are you doing?

686
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,400
Kneel and crawl over here.

687
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,600
Are you crazy?

688
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,880
I will let her go.

689
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,400
- Crawl.
-Hurry, crawl.

690
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,000
Don't listen to him, Xiao Mo.

691
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,440
No, don't listen to him.

692
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,720
Xiao Mo!

693
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,200
No!

694
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,120
Quick.

695
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,240
Ma Chengjun, you bastard!

696
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,760
No, Xiao Mo.

697
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,560
Come here.

698
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,480
You better keep your word.

699
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,680
Sure, I simply want to gauge how far

700
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,600
you're willing to go

701
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,040
for this woman.

702
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,120
Xiao Mo!

703
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,920
Xiao Mo, don't listen to him!

704
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,920
No!

705
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,840
Crawl here.

706
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,120
Can you let her go now?

707
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,720
Hit him.

708
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,360
Fight back!

709
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,920
Xiao Mo, you have to fight back!

710
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,640
Stop!

711
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,920
Look at him.

712
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,440
Look at your hero.

713
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,280
Look at him.

714
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,880
Look at him, this is your Xiao Mo.

715
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,680
Your great hero.

716
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,360
How's it?

717
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,680
I'm begging you.

718
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,320
I beg you.

719
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,200
I promise to do everything you say.

720
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,720
Ask them to stop.

721
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,040
I'm begging you.

722
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,920
Please.

723
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,720
Tell them to stop now.

724
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,880
Ma Chengjun.

725
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,760
Aren't you very good at fighting?

726
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,800
Look at you now.

727
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,280
Get up.

728
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,040
Get up.

729
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,160
Trash will always be trash.

730
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,200
Is that all you got?

731
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,840
Lin Yan!

732
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,680
Lin Yan!

733
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,040
Lin Yan.

734
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,480
Lin Yan!

735
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,480
- Mr. Xiao.
- Mr. Xiao.

736
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,200
Come.

737
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,000
Stop him.

738
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,880
Fight them!

739
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,680
Lin Yan!

740
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,320
Xiao Mo,

741
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,560
I was wrong about you.

742
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,600
I'm sorry.

743
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,000
Lin Yan.

744
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,280
Lin Yan!

745
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,200
I've already helped you
regain control of the Lin Corporation

746
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,840
and I've fulfilled Mr. Lin's wishes.

747
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,640
I should return to Mingde

748
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,400
and fulfill my duties.

749
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:17,840
So,

750
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,040
you're leaving me?

751
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,080
Is that so?

752
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,120
Mingde and Lin Corporation
are competitors.

753
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
Besides, I've promised my father

754
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,840
that I won't interfere
with Lin Corporation anymore.

755
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,280
Take care of yourself.

756
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,760
Xiao Mo.

757
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:49,960
Xiao Mo.

758
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,040
Xiao Mo.

759
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,920
Can you please don't leave me?

760
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,120
Can we go back
to how things were before?

761
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,800
I really miss the time
we spent together.

762
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,600
Xiao Mo.

763
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,400
Xiao Mo.

764
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,760
I'm no longer
the same Xiao Mo as before.

765
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,680
Xiao Mo.

766
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,800
To the groom, do you want to take
this girl as your wife

767
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,320
and be together for eternity.

768
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,040
I disagree.

769
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,120
I don't agree.

770
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,000
You're not allowed to marry anyone else.

771
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Xiao Mo,

772
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,520
I'm sorry.

773
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,120
I was wrong.

774
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,520
I shouldn't have misunderstood you

775
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,040
and driven you away.

776
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,080
Every day you've been away,

777
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,160
I've been thinking about you.

778
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,080
Every time I faced difficulties,

779
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,000
you were there by my side.

780
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,120
You're my guardian angel.
I can't be without you.

781
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,880
From now on,

782
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,880
you're my top priority.

783
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,960
No matter what happens in the future,

784
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,920
I'll always choose you.

785
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,360
Believe me.

786
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,520
I love you.

787
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,920
Will you marry me?

788
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,080
If you're not willing now, it's okay.

789
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
I'll wait for you.

790
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,640
You used to wait for me, protect me.

791
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,920
Now, it's my turn to wait for you.

792
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,320
I'll wait

793
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,600
until the day you want to marry me.

Back then, you asked me for help.

I said that if all settled down,
