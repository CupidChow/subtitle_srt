[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 4]

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,280
Turns out, you're the one who caused
that accident three years ago.

3
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
You hit me because of Lin Yan?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,120
Lin Yan is the heiress
of Lin Corporation.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
You, Wen Lili, are a nobody!

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,920
A few years ago,

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,120
did you plan to dump me

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,600
after marrying Lin Yan?

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,480
Have you lost your mind?

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,320
Even today,
you're still asking for trouble,

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,200
making Lin Yan remember that day.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,600
Won't we both be screwed?

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,280
Lin Yan is definitely pretending.

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,560
She has never lost her memory.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't care
if she lost her memory or not.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,960
I warn you.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
Don't ever cause trouble for me again.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Lin Yan, I'm not finished with you.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,720
Mr. Xiao, at six o'clock tonight,

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,440
you'll have a business dinner

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,760
at the Global Financial Tower
invited by Director Li from Fanya Group.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,160
A video conference with Blackwater
International Security Advisors

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,040
from the United States at eight.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,440
And a private dinner
with Director Jin at ten.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,120
Don't forget.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,560
Li,

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,560
where's my motorcycle?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,240
Cancel all the plans for tonight.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,160
I need to go out.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,760
Is our boss dating someone?

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,160
Impossible, absolutely impossible.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,280
What do you mean by that?

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
He doesn't seem to be interested
in women at all.

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,080
You know nothing.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,240
Why did you ask me here?

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,040
You saw Ma Chengjun
take the Lin Corporation from you.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,160
What's your take on this?

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,680
This is my business.

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,320
It's none of your concern.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,320
I want to make a deal with you.

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
What kind of deal?

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
I can help you reclaim
the Lin Corporation.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,680
But I have one condition.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
After it's done,

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,960
I want half of your shares.

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Half?

47
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,160
What makes you think
you can propose such a condition?

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,000
Because in this world,

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,360
only I can help you.

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,080
I can ensure your safety as well.

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,720
Why should I trust you?

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
Where have you been all these years?

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
Why have you suddenly returned?

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,800
What's your agenda?

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,480
Are you afraid?

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
If you want to know, I can tell you.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm not interested.

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,760
If you're just after money,

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,680
considering you helped me last time,
I can provide that.

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,840
What do you want
with the Lin Corporation's shares?

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,600
You don't need to worry
about these things.

62
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,760
You're not trying to seek revenge

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,600
because I fired you back then, are you?

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,080
If your father were still alive,

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,320
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

66
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,600
Don't bring up my father.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,880
You're no longer his special assistant.

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,200
I don't need your help.

69
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
I can handle it myself.

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,200
(The first step of the plan is to regain
the position of chairwoman.)

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,280
Surprise!

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,040
This is for my dear Yan.

73
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
Thank you.

74
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,800
Yan, you look very beautiful today.

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,680
Quite different from before.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Why is that?

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
After all, I was in a coma for so long.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
I should check on the company.

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
You haven't fully recovered yet.

80
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,360
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,640
Besides, the company has me.

82
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,720
But I really want to work

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,600
and leave work with you every day.

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,720
If you truly want that,

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll rush back to be with you

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,480
as soon as I finish work every day.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,720
Alright?

88
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,080
By the way,

89
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
I was worried you couldn't
take care of yourself,

90
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,760
so I found a caregiver for you.

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,360
Can you guess who it is?

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Auntie!

93
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,240
I'm coming. Miss Lin, hello.

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,160
I'm the carer who took care
of you at the hospital.

95
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,680
The IV has to run slow,
or the body won't handle it.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,600
Don't worry.

97
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,240
I'll take good care of her.

98
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,080
With this slow drip,

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
how can I play mahjong at night?

100
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,600
It's all your fault!

101
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,600
Lin Corporation's heiress,
what's the big deal?

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,080
You're just trying to make a living
under my supervision.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,920
Such a fair face.

104
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,360
Today, I'll make it more rosy.

105
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,280
It's Lili's aunt.

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
Quite a coincidence, isn't it?

107
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
Auntie is very honest.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Yes.

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,640
If you need anything,

110
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
just let me know.

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,760
Alright.

112
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,280
It's almost nine
and I'll have a meeting.

113
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,520
I can't stay with you.

114
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,240
Rest well at home.

115
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Miss Lin,

116
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
would you like me
to give you a leg massage?

117
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,640
Sure.

118
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,440
Auntie, come here.

119
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Let me explain the rules
of the Lin family to you.

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Please, I can hear you from here.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
Come closer.

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,480
Are you hitting me?

123
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,040
I'll tell Mr. Ma!

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Are you crazy?

125
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,280
Stop it!

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,680
Help!

127
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,440
As a servant in Lin's family,

128
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,720
your face can't be too fair,

129
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
so I'm making it more rosy.

130
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,320
It had nothing to do with me.

131
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,160
It was Wen Lili who told me to do it.

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,480
Wen Lili?

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
She's my best friend.

134
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,440
Why would she let you bully me?

135
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
It was true.

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,360
Wen Lili told me to hit you.

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
She's my niece.

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
She has been having an affair
with Mr. Ma,

139
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,680
so she asked me to hit you.

140
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,840
She also asked me to be your caregiver,

141
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
just to keep an eye on you.

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,440
It really has nothing to do with me.

143
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,680
Would you dare to say these things
in front of Ma Chengjun?

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,080
My job

145
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,240
and my son's job

146
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,360
were all arranged by Lili.

147
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,120
I can do that too.

148
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,360
Here's a million.

149
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,680
Don't forget.

150
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm the true heiress
of the Lin Corporation.

151
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,760
Alright.

152
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll tell you.

153
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
I'll tell you everything.

154
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,520
Yan.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,400
What's wrong? Is something going on?

156
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,840
Chengjun,

157
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,040
Auntie said you
and Wen Lili are involved.

158
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,040
What?

159
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,000
I...

160
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm... I'm with Wen Lili?

161
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,840
Impossible!

162
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
You... You mustn't believe it.

163
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,360
It's absolutely impossible.

164
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,400
But I thought...

165
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,040
you've been so good to me.

166
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,680
And Lili is my best friend.

167
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
How could I believe her?

168
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,320
Right.

169
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,600
There's no way that I could
be involved with Wen Lili.

170
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,520
Don't care

171
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,600
about her nonsense.

172
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
And you!

173
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,000
Isn't she the caregiver you found?

174
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,360
Isn't she your aunt?

175
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
What nonsense was she talking about?

176
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,440
How dare you, Lin Yan!

177
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,760
You dared to play tricks on me.

178
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,080
Despicable troublemaker!

179
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,600
Lili!

180
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm your auntie. You hit me?

181
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,680
Hit me, huh?

182
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,080
Try this!

183
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's talk it out.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't use violence!

185
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,320
God, please stop fighting!

186
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
What's gotten into you?

187
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,920
Can't you stop fighting?

188
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,160
So, that's what it is.

189
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
This auntie

190
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,880
wanted money from me,
so she stirred up trouble.

191
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,920
That's right, Yan.

192
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,160
It was my bad.

193
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,680
I chose the wrong person.

194
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,160
If you want to blame me,

195
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,840
I'll accept it.

196
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,160
Silly Lili.

197
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,480
How could I let the words
of a malicious person

198
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,160
affect our relationship?

199
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,600
That's good to hear.

200
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,520
But during the three years
when I was in the hospital,

201
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,000
you and Chengjun were always together.

202
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
It's natural for people
at the company to gossip.

203
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,520
Tomorrow, I'll issue an order
at the company.

204
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,920
Anyone who spreads rumors

205
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,080
will be immediately fired.

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
I want to go back to the company.

207
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Alright.

208
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
If I go back

209
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,400
and they see us together all the time,

210
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,000
maybe the rumors about you and Lili

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,480
can be dispelled.

212
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
You haven't fully recovered yet.

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
You should rest first.

214
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Chengjun.

215
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,400
Yeah.

216
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
You can go back to the company.

217
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
But I have one request.

218
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
What request?

219
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,120
Since you're going back,

220
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
you'll be the real chairwoman.

221
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,680
All company decisions

222
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
should be made by you.

223
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
Are you crazy?

224
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Passing her the power to make decisions?

225
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,080
Lin Yan was the nominal chairwoman
of the company to begin with.

226
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
In all fairness,

227
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,920
I can't stop her
from returning to the company.

228
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,040
You let her become the chairwoman.

229
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,160
But the Tengfei project will begin soon.

230
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,440
What if she discovers
any issues in it...

231
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,920
Why are you so naive?

232
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,720
You think I'm stupid?

233
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,600
Do you think things are that simple?

234
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Just wait and see what will happen.

235
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,640
(Dad, I'm back.)

236
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,560
(Lin Corporation meant
the world to you.)

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,600
(I will take it back no matter what.)

238
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,040
Yan.

239
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,840
My dear niece is back.

240
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm so happy, even happier
than buying ten limit-up stocks.

241
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,880
Uncle,

242
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
this is my first time attending
a board meeting since I woke up.

243
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
If any directors give me
a hard time on purpose,

244
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,040
you must help me.

245
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,760
Of course, we're all family here.

246
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,960
Your dad took such good care
of me back then.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,640
It's only right for me
to take care of you.

248
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,560
Don't worry. The board members

249
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,760
are all decent and cultured.

250
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,840
What nonsense!

251
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,080
Is Tengfei's team brain-dead?

252
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,640
This land should have been sold to us
from the beginning.

253
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
How can they break their words?

254
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,040
Is this even logical?

255
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
This is infuriating!

256
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,320
The people
from Tengfei Real Estate said

257
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,520
that we have changed the chairman.

258
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,160
They don't trust us anymore

259
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,080
and don't want to cooperate with us.

260
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,560
Isn't that nonsense?

261
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,360
(No wonder that Ma Chengjun was so kind)

262
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,200
(to let me take full control
of the company.)

263
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,040
(Turns out he has set a big trap here.)

264
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,280
This business is crucial

265
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,600
to our corporation's future.

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
So, we must find a way

267
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,520
to bring Ma Chengjun back

268
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,240
since Tengfei only wants Mr. Ma.

269
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,920
Your words are just nonsense.

270
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,160
You...

271
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
You what?

272
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
You can't just cooperate because
of a person and ignore the project.

273
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,560
So, what you're saying

274
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,960
is my niece should resign

275
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,160
on her first day?

276
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,320
That would be humiliating.

277
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,120
My niece, listen to me.

278
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
It's just one project.

279
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,640
Just a piece of land.

280
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,360
Just a loss of over a billion.

281
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
I'll stand by you.

282
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,960
Your uncle stands by you 100%.

283
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,880
How can you
make impulsive decisions in business?

284
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,960
What do you mean by that?

285
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,480
You all dare not take responsibility!

286
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,560
You're all cowards!

287
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
What are you saying?

288
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,280
Am I wrong?

289
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Say it again if you dare!

290
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,400
Nonsense! You're just nonsense!

291
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,680
What do you want?

292
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,560
Why are you acting like a fool?

293
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,000
Useless.

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
You are crazy!

295
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,680
-A lunatic!
-Useless!

296
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,320
Sleazing. That's all you're good at.

297
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,920
You're full of crap!

298
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,560
You piece of trash!

299
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
Don't stop me.

300
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,760
Don't stop me! Let me tell you...

301
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,240
Sleazing. That's all you're good at.

302
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,480
You're full of crap!

303
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,760
You bunch of ungrateful people!

304
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,760
Betraying Dad,
betraying Lin Corporation!

305
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,520
Jerks!

306
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
All of you!

307
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
Miss Wen told us

308
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,320
to make sure
this woman's reputation is ruined.

309
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,840
I'll go up first.
