[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 22]

2
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,320
Where is Ma Chengjun?

3
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,760
Did they catch him?

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,600
Ma Chengjun got hit
in the head by Wen Lili's car.

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,320
Maybe he'll never wake up.

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
There's solid evidence
that Wen Lili deliberately hurt him.

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,920
She's probably going to prison.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,640
The police have already
started investigating.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
But right now, she's mentally unstable

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,840
and still in the hospital.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,360
These two deserve what they got.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,040
Xiao Mo, I have a question for you.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,440
Did Mingde withdraw funding
from Ma Chengjun

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,760
because of you?

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,120
Well,

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,240
why did you change your name
and identity then?

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,040
He was really awful to my mom.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,000
From the time she got sick
until she passed away,

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,400
he never once visited her
in the hospital.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
He remarried right after my mom's death,

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,520
so I don't like him.

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,600
I don't want to see him

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
or let him know where I am.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,080
You must have had a tough time

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,560
when you were young.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,240
Thankfully, I met Mr. Lin.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,960
He took good care of me.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,360
I had a dream just now,

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,000
and my dad entrusted me to you.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,520
He asked you to take good care of me.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,560
Xiao Mo,

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
I know everything.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
The person who has been with me
for these three years

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,160
was you.

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
Mr. Lin did ask me

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
to take care of you

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
before he passed away.

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
But everything I've done

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,120
is simply to repay Mr. Lin's kindness.

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,840
What about your feelings for me?

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,200
Take a good rest now.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,160
I'm leaving.

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,720
Where are you going?

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,920
(Don't you need to fulfill)

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
(your promise?)

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,160
Come back and take over Mingde.

47
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,400
I won't break my promise to you.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,920
I've already helped you
regain control of the Lin Corporation

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,560
and I've fulfilled Mr. Lin's wishes.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
I should return to Mingde

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,120
and fulfill my duties.

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,560
So,

53
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,760
you're leaving me?

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
Is that so?

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,840
Mingde and Lin Corporation
are competitors.

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Besides, I've promised my father

57
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,560
that I won't interfere
with Lin Corporation anymore.

58
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
Take care of yourself.

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,480
Xiao Mo.

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Xiao Mo.

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,760
Xiao Mo.

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,640
Can you please don't leave me?

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,840
Can we go back
to the way we were before?

64
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,520
I really miss the time
we spent together.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
Xiao Mo.

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
Xiao Mo.

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm no longer
the same Xiao Mo as before.

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Xiao Mo.

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Calm down.

70
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,760
(How you helped my dad before,)

71
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,360
(do the same for me now.)

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
(You also want me to be)

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,160
(your all day personal bodyguard?)

74
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Wherever you are,

75
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll show up in an instant.

76
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,040
(You asked me
to put on an act with you?)

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
(Fine.)

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
(Since it's an act,)

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
(then let's make it more convincing.)

80
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
(You'd better not regret it later.)

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,400
(From now on,)

82
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,680
(I'm formally pursuing you.)

83
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,520
(Is your heart made of stone?)

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
(I don't love you.)

85
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,720
(Leave now.)

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
(The best things come)

87
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,480
(when you least expect them to.)

88
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
(Never frown,)

89
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,280
(even when you are sad,)

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,080
(because you never know)

91
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
(who is falling in love
with your smile.)

92
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,680
(To the world,)

93
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,640
(you may be one person.)

94
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,920
(But to one person,)

95
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,480
(you may be the world.)

96
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,440
Yan,

97
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,720
why are you still here?

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
What's wrong?

99
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Don't you know?

100
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
The news online is going crazy.

101
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,960
Xiao Mo, the heir of Mingde Corporation,

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,520
and Miss Yang of Yang Corporation
will have a marriage of convenience.

103
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,840
The wedding is today.

104
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,720
Now, let's welcome the groom.

105
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,640
Mr. Xiao, do you want
to take this girl as your wife

106
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,160
and be together for eternity?

107
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I disagree.

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,960
I don't agree.

109
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
You're not allowed to marry anyone else.

110
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Xiao Mo,

111
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,960
I was wrong.

113
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,360
I shouldn't have misunderstood you

114
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,880
and driven you away.

115
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,920
Every day you've been away,

116
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
I've been thinking about you.

117
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
Every time I faced difficulties,

118
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,840
you were there by my side.

119
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,960
You're my guardian angel.
I can't be without you.

120
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,720
From now on,

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
you're my top priority.

122
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
No matter what will happen
in the future,

123
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
I'll always choose you.

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Believe me.

125
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I love you.

126
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
Will you marry me?

127
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,920
If you're not willing now, it's okay.

128
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
I'll wait for you.

129
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,480
You used to wait for me, protect me.

130
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
Now, it's my turn to wait for you.

131
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,160
I'll wait

132
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,440
until the day you want to marry me.
