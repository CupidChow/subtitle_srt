[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 8]

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,320
Yan,

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,720
we can't stay in this hotel.

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,040
Its design is not reasonable
at all, right?

5
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,760
The distance between the room
and the restaurant is too far.

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,240
It will be tiring to walk.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,600
Chengjun, what do you
really want to say?

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,640
I want to say

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,720
that we should change to another hotel.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,400
Isn't this your favorite hotel?

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,880
I remembered the last time

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,920
you booked this hotel

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,000
for the honeymoon after our marriage.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,520
I thought you remembered.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,960
I never thought you would forget it all.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,520
What are you doing?

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,120
I think this hotel is good too.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,720
Look at this umbrella in the lobby.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,080
The workmanship is awesome

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,400
and exquisite.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,160
I think we can stay here.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,880
You're not listening at all.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,200
How could I forget?

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,600
I still remember the first time we met.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,120
You were at the library's front door,

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,800
holding a red umbrella.

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,600
That was so lovely.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,880
I've finished the room reservation.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll take you there.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,840
Okay.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,320
Why is he here?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,520
Xiao Mo is my personal bodyguard.

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,000
Of course, he has to
protect me 24 hours.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,600
Don't worry.

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
We will have

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,960
a very memorable holiday.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,000
(Lin Yan and I also came
to this hotel for vacation.)

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,160
[Wen Lili]
(You have to leave immediately.)

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,280
[Wen Lili]
(Don't let her see you.)

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
Chengjun,

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
be quick.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
This is your room.

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm next door.

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
Just call me anytime
if you need something.

45
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,760
Okay.

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
You brat did it on purpose, right?

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,120
Mr. Ma,

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,200
your room is over there.

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
You brat did it on purpose, right?

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,560
I…

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
I'll deal with you later.

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,960
Ma Chengjun, what do you mean by this?

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
Why did you bring Lin Yan here?

54
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,800
I don't have time
to explain all of this now.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,080
Anyway, you have to leave immediately.

56
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,920
I will explain it to you later.

57
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,720
Ma Chengjun.

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,520
Ma…

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
Why did you agree
to go on vacation with Ma Chengjun?

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Is it because you still
have feelings for him?

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,520
How could I possibly
still have feelings for him?

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,760
I don't really have amnesia.

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,960
So, what is your purpose?

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,680
Wen Lili is also in this hotel.

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,800
So, I think as long as Wen Lili is here,

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,520
Ma Chengjun will not

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,560
keep forcing me to marry him.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
We need to find something for him to do.

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,240
This way, we'll have more time
to discover more of his flaws.

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Isn't that correct?

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
[Ma Chengjun]
(Yan, I've prepared a surprise for you.)

72
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,480
(I guarantee you will like it.)

73
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,760
(Meet me downstairs later.)

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,760

This is for my beloved princess, Yan.

87

I'm really surprised and overwhelmed.

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
Don't be too surprised and overwhelmed.

89
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,080
I have a more important gift for you.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Jun, a prince who loves you forever.

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
Wait.

92
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,720
Yan,

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,680
you haven't been willing
to get close to me since you woke up.

94
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
How could it be possible?

95
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,400
I'm just thinking
as you carefully designed these,

96
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,360
I need to figure out a way
to keep a memento.

97
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,600
Let's take a picture.

98
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,440
Yes.

99
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,400
Three, two…

100
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,900
[Lin Yan: It's another beautiful day.]

101
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,800
Stupid Ma Chengjun.

102
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,040
You want to dump me

103
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,000
and be lovey-dovey
with Lin Yan, don't you?

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Don't ever think about it.

105
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,120
Yan, how about the wedding date
that I mentioned last time?

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,800
[Wen Lili]
(Honey, I want to meet you.)

107
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,600
[Wen Lili]
(I'm in the dress you like the most.)

108
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,560
You look very busy.
Who is looking for you?

109
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,400
My subordinate, Li.

110
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,280
All are business-related matters.
No need to worry.

111
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,280
[Wen Lili]
(I am now at your room's front door.)

112
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,200
(I'll go for you if you are not
showing up in five minutes.)

113
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
I need to make a phone call.

114
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,960
Enjoy the meal.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,400
I will be back soon.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Wait for me.

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,680
Why is Lin Yan also at this hotel?

118
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you deliberately want me to leave?

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
This is just a coincidence.

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,240
I also don't know

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
why Lin Yan booked this hotel.

122
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
There are not that many coincidences
in this world.

123
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Ma Chengjun, do you really
fall in love with Lin Yan?

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
Could you please stop
making trouble for no reason?

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,320
Anyway, quickly change to another hotel.

126
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,800
We will be doomed if Lin Yan sees us.

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,360
No.

128
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,600
Come on, stop it.

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Don't you usually like it when I act up?

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,080
It's different now, okay?

131
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,600
Could you please stop undressing me?

132
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
Could you please listen?

133
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,400
Chengjun, have you
finished talking to Li?

134
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,000
The steak won't taste good
as it gets cold.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,640
I will be back soon.

136
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,520
Get off.

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
Pack your things and leave quickly.

138
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,920
What took you so long?

139
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
Business is too complicated.

140
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Dig in.

141
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
Let me feed you.

143
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
Delicious, right?

144
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,320
Yes.

145
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,440
The steak will be perfect with red wine.

146
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Cheers.

147
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,600
Cheers.

148
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,560
Finish it.

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Okay.

150
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,680
Are you okay?

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,560
[Wen Lili]
(I'm in your room. Come right away.)

152
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,520
(If not, I will send this to Lin Yan.)

153
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,240
Is it Li again?

154
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,600
Why is he so annoying today?

155
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,000
I will come back soon.

156
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,600
Wen Lili,

157
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,040
are you deliberately messing with me?

158
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll deal with you after vomitting.

159
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,000
I...

160
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
Chengjun, it's me.

161
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,800
You're here, right?

162
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,360
Chengjun, I know you are inside.
Why didn't you open the door?

163
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
Did something happen?

164
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
What are you doing?
I'm not afraid of her.

165
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,680
Keep your voice down.

166
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,400
Hide quietly in the washroom,
don't make any sound.

167
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,920
If Lin Yan sees you today,

168
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,120
I'll cut ties with you.

169
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll do what I said.

170
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,280
Did something happen?

171
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,360
Chengjun.

172
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,400
Yan, why are you coming here?

173
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,280
Chengjun, I'm worried about you.

174
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
Why did you back here
as the meal was not finished?

175
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,800
I'm back here…

176
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,960
It's because I felt uncomfortable
with my stomach.

177
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,360
I just came out of the toilet.

178
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,120
Now, it's done.

179
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,120
Let's go back to eat.

180
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,240
Yes.

181
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,560
Wait, I found your room

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,120
much better than mine.

183
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,800
Isn't the layout the same?

184
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,520
The angle is good.

185
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,000
There's plenty of natural light.

186
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,760
This…

187
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
What's good about it?

188
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,640
Let's go back to eat, please.

189
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,400
I see that the furniture here
is newer than that in my room.

190
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,120
Yan.

191
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,080
So, your toilet must be better too.

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,160
I would like to see it.

193
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,840
Yan,

194
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,280
I just used the toilet.

195
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,440
So, it must be smelly there.

196
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,160
It's no problem for me.

197
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,200
It looks like the toilet
is about the same as mine.

198
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
What's interesting about a restroom?

199
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,200
Let's get back.

200
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,400
Wait, I want to wash my hands first.

201
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,760
Okay.

202
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Yan, don't you think
that the steak is getting cold?

203
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
Let's go back to the restaurant quickly.

204
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,480
No need to rush.

205
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,440
Done.

206
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,880
Yes, let's go back.

207
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,840
Actually, I'm already full.

208
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,000
I was just teasing you earlier.

209
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,360
Take a rest earlier today,
I'll go to bed now.

210
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay.

211
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,080
Have a good rest.

212
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,480
Lili, are you okay?

213
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,920
Sir, please take her
to the hospital quickly.

214
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,880
Since you're like this,
don't talk anymore.

215
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,280
I cannot accompany you.

216
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,440
I cannot leave,
you have to go by yourself.

217
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,040
Be good.

218
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,840
Drive.

219
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,280
What's the matter with you?

220
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,880
What are you doing?

221
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Let me go.

222
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,040
What are you doing?

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,360
What are you doing?

224
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,240
You let him kiss you.

225
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
It's just part of the plan.

226
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,200
Do you really want to take a revenge

227
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,520
or do you still like Ma Chengjun?

228
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,880
It's just a kiss on the cheek,

229
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,160
it doesn't mean anything.

230
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
So, it doesn't matter
if anyone kisses you?

231
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,680
Yes, it doesn't matter.
