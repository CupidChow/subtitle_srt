[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 17]

2
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,560
Yan,

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,760
do you still remember
the freshmen dance party?

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,720
You were in a white dress.

5
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,560
I fell for you at first sight.

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,040
At that time, I swore
I would make you fall for me.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,440
Then, I would love and take care of you
for the rest of my life.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,760
The way you love me,

9
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,240
is it just to watch me
fall from the rooftop?

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Since you started this topic,

11
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
I won't hide it anymore.

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,520
Do you really think I believe
you have lost your memory?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
Life is like a drama,

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,240
it all depends on acting skills.

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
Aren't you pretending
to have amnesia in front of me

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,280
just to force me to return
the money I've taken?

17
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,840
You've prepared everything,

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,240
but you'll never expect

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,400
that I could find someone
as naive as Wen Lili

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
to use as a scapegoat.

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,560
So, the current situation

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,560
is not that I'm begging you,

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,840
but that you're begging me.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
I will resign
from Lin Corporation tomorrow

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
and settle abroad.

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,560
I will also promptly
announce to the media

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,360
that Wen Lili forged signatures
to transfer assets.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,560
At that time, Lin Corporation's
stock value will plummet

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
and it will be completely over then.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,240
I can't spend all the money
your father earned in my lifetime.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,520
If Mr. Lin were still alive,

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
he could see with his own eyes

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,600
how the Lin Corporation
he had worked hard his entire life for

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
would be destroyed by me step by step.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,120
Ma Chengjun!

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't shout at me!

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,680
Fortunately, I have a habit.

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
I can still give a chance

39
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
to those who are in desperation.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,600
Moreover, it's you.

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,040
I can stay,

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,840
but Xiao Mo has to leave.

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,640
Do you want me to leave?

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,920
This is all I can do now.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,920
I just can't watch Lin Corporation

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520
destroyed by Ma Chengjun.

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,920
Is it true

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,760
that in your heart, Lin Corporation
will always be the first?

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,880
Lin Corporation is my dad's hard work.

50
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,080
I have to protect it no matter what.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
As long as you're willing,

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,560
I can deal with him now.

53
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
What do you want to do?

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
I am not allowing you
to do anything dangerous.

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,840
But, I definitely won't allow you
to be with him.

56
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
Xiao Mo,

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
you're fired.

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,840
From now on,

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
you aren't my bodyguard anymore.

60
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,640
Anything about me
has nothing to do with you anymore.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,720
What about our feelings?

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,920
Listen.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,200
I've never loved you.

64
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
All of these were just
your wishful thinking.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Say that again.

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I don't love you.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,400
Just leave now.

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
Wherever you are,

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,440
I will appear immediately.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,160
Mrs. Xiao, something happened.

71
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Something happened to Mr. Xiao.

72
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,940
[Operating]

73
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Where is Xiao Mo?

74
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,320
Mrs. Xiao.

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,120
Mr. Xiao, he...

76
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
Patient's family, please sign here.

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,000
Xiao Mo, wake up.

78
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,040
Xiao mo, wake up quickly.

79
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,200
Xiao Mo.

80
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,800
I haven't said yes to you yet.

81
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,680
I haven't told you how much I like you.

82
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,920
You cannot die.

83
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,240
I've liked you for a long time.

84
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,120
Everything I told you was a lie.

85
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,640
As long as you wake up now,

86
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,560
Lin Corporation and other things
are not important.

87
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,160
You are the most important one.

88
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,520
Xiao Mo, wake up. Xiao Mo.

89
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
I love you.

90
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,280
I love you.

91
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,120
Wake up.

92
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,160
Is everything you said true?

93
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,880
You're not dead?

94
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,720
Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.
Finally, you won Mrs. Xiao's heart.

95
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,080
Congratulations.

96
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,240
Are you lying to me too?

97
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,840
I see, Xiao Mo.

98
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,760
Do you know how much
I was worried about you?

99
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,320
I'll be dead for real
if you hit me again.

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,080
Sorry.

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,400
Are you okay?

102
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,360
It's just a rear-end collision.
The doctor said it was a minor injury.

103
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm fine.

104
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,840
Then,

105
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,680
what did you sign just now?

106
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,800
Just now?

107
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,800
It was the signing
for Mr. Xiao's discharge.

108
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,880
Mrs. Xiao, don't worry.

109
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Mr. Xiao is in good health.

110
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,280
Since you are in good health,
I'll leave.

111
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Where are you going?

112
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,320
I heard everything you've just said.

113
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
I just...

114
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
What did I say?

115
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
You said you love me.

116
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,400
I also love you.

117
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't be stressed.

118
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
This is not a proposal.

119
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
It just means

120
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,760
that you are booked by me.

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,680
From now on,

122
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
you are Xiao Mo's girl.

123
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,120
Mr. Xiao, it turns out
that you are so good at this.

124
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,040
Go.

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,440
Booked? So, it means

126
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
I can still change my mind?

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
I've stamped it.

128
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Now, you don't have a chance
to change your mind.

129
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,400
It's shivering.

130
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,760
I can't stand it. My eyes.

131
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,280
We'll go, Mr. Xiao.

132
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,800
Be gentle.

133
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,760
Close the door.

134
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,400
Yes.

135
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,840
Promise me.

136
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,200
No matter what difficulties
you encounter in the future,

137
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,400
let me stay by your side.

138
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,040
We'll face it together,

139
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,400
