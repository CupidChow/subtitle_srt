00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,980
[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 2]

2
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you crazy?

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,160
Yan,

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,720
don't be scared. Hold tight.

5
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,120
Chengjun, she knew about us.

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,560
She won't let us off easily.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Ma Chengjun!

8
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,160
We'll be screwed if she doesn't die.

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,400
Help me.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,280
Please help me.

11
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,160
Don't blame me.

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
(Lin Yan, Chairwoman of Lin Corporation,
recently fell from a building.)

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,800
(According to reports,)

14
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
(the accident occurred when Lin Yan
and her fiance, Ma Chengjun,)

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,880
(were taking selfies on the rooftop
on their wedding day.)

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,760
(Lin Yan suffered severe head trauma
and may be in a permanent coma.)

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,680
(Lin Corporation is currently)

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
(under the full leadership)

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,440
(of her fiance, former CEO Ma Chengjun.)

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Everyone, starting today,

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,200
we'll have a new chairman
at Lin Corporation,

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,520
Mr. Ma Chengjun.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Yan,

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,640
didn't you want me to find happiness?

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,680
You can relax now.

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
Chengjun and I

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,320
are definitely going to be happy.

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,680
(Once the press conference
goes smoothly tomorrow,)

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,560
(we can transfer all
of Lin Corporation's remaining assets.)

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,400
[Three years later]
(The plan will be completed.)

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
(Then,)

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,680
(we can be together openly.)

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,240
(But the timing isn't right just yet.)

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,120
(Lin Yan is still alive.)

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,120
(Even though she might
be in a vegetative state forever,)

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,040
(for now,
I'm still her fiance on paper.)

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,440
So, you mean

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,560
while Lin Yan lies there
in a coma day after day,

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,600
we can only sneak around

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,120
and can't be out in the open?

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,440
You've even moved
into the Lin family's house,

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,760
how much more "out in the open"
can we be?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,720
Announcing it to the world
with a megaphone or something?

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,320
I was just thinking...

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
Thinking what?

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Such a mood killer.

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,440
Starting today,

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,040
I don't want to hear anything
about Lin Yan.

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,720
Do you know what to do now?

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,960
Understand.

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,120
You saved me yesterday.

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,200
Yeah.

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
Why were you at the hospital last night?

54
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
I happened to pass by.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,760
Happened to?

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,520
What's your relationship
with Ma Chengjun?

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,520
Don't you remember?

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Back then, it was Ma Chengjun
who asked you to fire me.

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,840
So, after you left Lin Corporation,

60
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,120
where did you go?

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,920
It doesn't matter anymore.

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,080
Drink it.

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,080
No, thanks.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
I want to go home.

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,160
Given your current condition,

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,520
what do you think you could do?

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,040
I can go to see my uncle.

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
I can look for my dad's old associates.

69
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Ma Chengjun is a completely
different person now.

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,240
You can't mess with him.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
Now, everyone in the company

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
is on Ma Chengjun's side.

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
In reality, you're already homeless.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,520
Ma Chengjun and Wen Lili

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,760
are living in your house

76
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,440
and spending your money.

77
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Even if you regain control
of the company,

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,440
it won't matter.

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,360
Ma Chengjun has already transferred
most of the company's assets.

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,240
Lin Corporation is just an empty shell.

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
Maybe I can help you.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
No need.

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,040
Just take me back to Lin Corporation.

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,080
[News Conference]
distinguished guests,

86
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,560
the real estate project
of Lin Corporation and Tengfei Company

87
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,760
is about to begin.

88
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760

in welcoming our chairman,
Mr. Ma Chengjun, for his speech.

90
