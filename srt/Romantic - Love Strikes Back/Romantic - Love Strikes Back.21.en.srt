[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 21]

2
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,920
Mr. Xiao, Mrs. Xiao may be in danger.

3
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,400
Looking for Lin Yan, right?

4
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,440
What did you do to Lin Yan?

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Prepare the money I need.

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,560
Then arrange for me to go abroad.

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,440
Do you want Lin Yan?

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,240
Come here alone.

9
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,920
If you dare to call the police,

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,760
I cannot guarantee
the safety of Lin Yan.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,240
Mr. Xiao, is it about Mrs. Xiao?

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,520
I will go gather our people.

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,360
All of you stay here.

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
I'll go alone.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,360
Jun,

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,280
he has come.

17
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,760
Xiao Mo, not bad.

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,640
Dare to come alone.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
Where is Lin Yan?

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
Don't worry.

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
She's fine.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,000
I've already transferred

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
the money you want to your account

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,360
according to your request.

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
The procedures for going abroad
are also done.

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Only you could do that, Mr. Xiao.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,760
Such high efficiency.

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,480
Where is Lin Yan?

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,200
In my heart.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,160
I'm asking you where she is!

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,760
I love to see you in a panic.

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,920
I know you care about her

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,000
and can't let her go.

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,480
When I think of my woman

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,160
being with scums like you,

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
I can't bear it for a moment.

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,320
No need to endure it.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,480
Go.

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,560
Punch him.

40
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,680
Xiao Mo!

41
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,480
Xiao Mo!

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,760
Ma Chengjun, you bastard.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Shut up.

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,360
Ma Chengjun.

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't move.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,320
Stay there, don't move.

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,960
Let go of her.

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,080
Let go of her?

49
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
That depends on how you behave.

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,680
What do you want?

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,280
I need so many things.

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,520
It all depends on what you're willing

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,160
to do for her.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,920
I can give you everything you want.

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,160
Everything?

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,080
I want you to kneel down now.

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Don't.

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Don't listen to him.

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,720
Don't.

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,120
Xiao Mo, don't listen to him.

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,960
Don't listen to him.

62
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,040
Kneel down.

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,160
- Kneel.
- Hurry up, kneel down.

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,080
Xiao Mo, don't listen to him.

65
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:34,960
Kneel.

66
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,980
- Crawl.
-Hurry, crawl.

67
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,640
What are you doing?

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Kneel and crawl over here.

69
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,120
Are you crazy?

70
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,400
I will let her go.

71
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,920
- Crawl.
-Hurry, crawl.

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
Don't listen to him, Xiao Mo.

73
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,960
No, don't listen to him.

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,240
Xiao Mo!

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,720
No!

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,640
Quick.

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,760
Ma Chengjun, you bastard!

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
No, Xiao Mo.

79
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,080
Come here.

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
You'd better keep your word.

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,200
Sure, I simply want to see how far

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,120
you're willing to go

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
for this woman.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,640
Xiao Mo!

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,440
Xiao Mo, don't listen to him!

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,440
No!

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,360
Crawl here.

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,640
Can you let her go now?

89
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,240
Hit him.

90
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Fight back!

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
Xiao Mo, you have to fight back!

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,160
Stop!

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
Look at him.

94
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,960
Look at your hero.

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,800
Look at him.

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,400
Look at him, this is your Xiao Mo.

97
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Your great hero.

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,880
How's it?

99
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,200
I'm begging you.

100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,840
I beg you.

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,720
I promise to do everything you say.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,240
Ask them to stop.

103
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm begging you.

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,440
Please.

105
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,240
Tell them to stop now.

106
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,400
Ma Chengjun.

107
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,280
Aren't you very good at fighting?

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,320
Look at you now.

109
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,800
Get up.

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
Get up.

111
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,680
Trash will always be trash.

112
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Is that all you got?

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Lin Yan!

114
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Lin Yan!

115
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,560
Lin Yan.

116
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,000
Lin Yan!

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
- Mr. Xiao.
- Mr. Xiao.

118
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,720
Come.

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
Stop him.

120
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,400
Fight them!

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,200
Lin Yan!

122
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,840
Xiao Mo,

123
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,080
I was wrong about you.

124
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,520
Lin Yan.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Lin Yan!

127
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Mr. Xiao.

128
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,920
Mr. Xiao.

129
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
You don't let me live in peace,

130
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,480
and I won't let you either.

131
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,320
Ma Chengjun.

132
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
It's over.

133
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Dad.

134
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Yan.

135
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
Take good care of my daughter.

136
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Xiao Mo.

137
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
Xiao Mo, are you okay?

138
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,640
