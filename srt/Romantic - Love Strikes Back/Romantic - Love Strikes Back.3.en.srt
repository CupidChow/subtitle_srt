[Episode 3]

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Chengjun,

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,520
I suddenly woke up today

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,280
and realized

5
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,400
I don't remember anything.

6
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,720
You

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,080
don't remember anything?

8
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,320
That's right, I don't remember anything.

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,920
What happened?

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,120
Great! This is wonderful!

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,080
Everyone, God must be moved
by my sincere feelings for Yan.

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,120
My fiancee, Lin Yan,

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
who had been in a coma for three years

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,720
after an accident,

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
miraculously

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,240
woke up today!

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,480
Yan,

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,320
this is amazing.

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,240
Chengjun, take me home, please.

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,040
Home?

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Really?

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Yan, I've missed you so much.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,440
Give me a hug.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Okay,

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
I'll take you home soon.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,800
I'll take you home soon.

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
Why did you turn right just now?

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,520
I thought we had to
turn left to go home.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,040
I think we should
go back to the hospital

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,520
for a thorough check-up.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
I'm fine, really.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,440
I just want to go home now.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,960
Yan,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,120
nobody has lived there
in the past three years.

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,320
It's musty inside.

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,440
I will have someone
to clean it up tomorrow.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
Once all are set,

38
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,680
we can move back in.

39
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,160
Chengjun,

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
you've been urging me
not to go home the whole way.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,960
You really don't want me
to go home, huh?

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
hiding another woman
at home or something?

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,960
How could that be?

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,320
You women are...

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,160
Just kidding, I know you won't.

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,600
In that case, let's go home.

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
We can clean it up together.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,320
Sounds good.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,920
Chengjun,

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,000
has no one lived here
in the past three years?

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,920
Of course not.

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,640
I was afraid it would remind me of you.

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,600
I didn't dare to come here.

56
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,560
But it looks so clean,

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,320
just like someone has been living here.

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
You found out.

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,560
I had a cleaning lady take care of it

60
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,160
because I knew this house

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
meant a lot to you.

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,840
What's this?

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
It's the cleaning lady's rag.

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,600
She just scattered things
all over the place.

65
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,240
It's highly absorbent.

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,920
I think I've smelled something.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,840
What is it?

68
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
It's kind of

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,800
a familiar woman's fragrance.

70
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,800
How is that possible?

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,120
There can't be another woman
in this house.

72
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
But if there is,

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,600
it must be the cleaning lady.

74
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,440
Oh, I see.

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
I missed this place so much.

76
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,920
I want to go upstairs and take a look.

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,400
Sure,

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
let's take a look around.

79
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,560
Chengjun.

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
Chengjun, where's Lili?

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
Lili?

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,280
Lili?

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I saw her car parked
in the yard from upstairs.

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,640
The car I gave her.

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,200
(Oh, that stupid Lili.)

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,520
Really?

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,520
Lili.

88
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
You're here.

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
I...

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
I couldn't help but worry about you,

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,840
so I came to check on you.

92
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,320
With such a great friend like you,

93
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,920
I feel so blessed.

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,680
It's the least I could do.

95
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,280
You're not wearing shoes?

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,600
I...

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,520
I came to see Mr. Ma
for some urgent matters at the company.

98
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,160
I was in such a hurry

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,120
that I forgot my shoes.
Where are my shoes?

100
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
Where are my shoes?

101
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
Chengjun,

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,000
the company needs you.

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,520
You all can go ahead first.

104
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,040
Sure.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,560
Get off.

106
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I'll drive.

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,680
I gave you everything!

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Why did you betray me?

109
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
There's nothing between Chengjun and me.

110
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,520
Give it back!

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,680
Are you crazy?

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,400
(Ma Chengjun!)

113
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,800
(We'll be screwed if she doesn't die.)

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,120
Help me.

115
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,760
Please help me.

116
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,640
Yan, don't blame me.

117
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,680
(Dad, I was wrong.)

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,120
(Lin Corporation
meant the world to you.)

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
(I won't let Ma Chengjun
destroy what you've built.)

120
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,640
(I will find evidence of their crimes)

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
(and make them give back
what they stole.)

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,320
(I will definitely
reclaim Lin Corporation.)

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,240
(Ma Chengjun,)

124
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,440
(Wen Lili,)

125
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,600
(I'm back.)

126
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,960
(I'll make both of you pay tenfold
for all the pain I've endured.)

127
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,560
The chance for a person
in a vegetative state

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,760
to wake up is very low,

129
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,000
but there's still a chance.

130
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
But if one wants to wake up
like Miss Lin,

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,280
he or she must be very lucky.

132
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
But why

133
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,320
did she only forget
what had happened that day?

134
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,280
Such a situation

135
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,480
is called selective amnesia
in medical science.

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,960
Certain memories
can make patients painful,

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,840
so the brain selectively
erases those memories.

138
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
Patients, when subjected
to certain stimuli,

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,360
can exhibit post-traumatic
stress behaviors

140
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,120
and can make some extreme reactions,

141
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,440
which might help them
recover their memories.

142
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,660
[You received a WeChat message]

143
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,880
Lili, what brings you here?

144
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,480
I want to take you out today

145
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,160
to get some fresh air,

146
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,080
which could be good for your recovery.

147
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,880
Where are we going?

148
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,840
You'll find out soon. Let's go.

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,960
Yan,

150
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,160
do you remember this place?

151
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,800
On the day of your wedding,

152
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,440
I prepared a gift for you here.

153
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
Do you remember what the gift was?

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,640
Why did you end up
on the rooftop that day?

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,240
(Did you fall on your own,)

156
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,880
(or did someone push you?)

157
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,920
Do you not remember any of these?

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Yan.

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,720
Yan, what are you doing?

160
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,520
What are you two doing?

161
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,440
What happened?

162
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,520
Chengjun,

163
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
how did I end up here?

164
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,160
What happened?

165
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,280
That's what I wanted to ask you both.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Lili, why are you all wet?

167
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't touch me!

168
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Chengjun,

169
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,040
Lili brought me here earlier,

170
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,680
saying she wanted me
to remember things from the past.

171
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,480
I remember that day,

172
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
she gave me a room key,

173
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,720
saying

174
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,800
there was a gift for me in the room,

175
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,480
so I went there.

176
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,720
Why was I on the rooftop?

177
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,920
Yan.

178
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,280
Why did I fall?

179
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,920
My head hurts so much, Chengjun.

180
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,400
Yan.

181
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:30,920
My head hurts!

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,240
Stop thinking about it.

183
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,880
Stop trying to remember
if your head hurts.

184
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,040
Stop trying to remember.

185
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,840
Don't think about it.

186
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,880
I'm here.

187
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,560
Stop thinking about it.
