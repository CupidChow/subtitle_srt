[Love Strikes Back]
[Episode 19]

2
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,840
So, what you are saying

3
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,200
is you used someone else's identity
to work at Lin Corporation

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
because your own identity is special.

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,560
What's so special about it?

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,400
If there weren't any issues
with your identity,

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,080
why bother borrowing someone else's?

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,880
I don't need to explain myself to you.

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,600
People who come out of prison
can't find jobs,

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,240
so they fake their identities.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,400
Then, why did you fake yours?

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,400
Murder or arson?

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,160
I have my own reasons.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,320
Please trust me.

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,080
He couldn't come up
with a better excuse than that.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,520
Who would believe you?

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,320
I believe you.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,520
I didn't want to embarrass you

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,720
in front of Ma Chengjun earlier.

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
Now he's gone.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Tell me.

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,240
Who are you actually?

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,760
What's your purpose at Lin Corporation?

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,480
And what's your relationship
with Mingde?

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,880
I can't explain

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,720
all of these to you right now.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,800
Did you know that Mingde supported

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,920
Ma Chengjun's acquisition
of Lin Corporation?

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,960
Why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm related to Mingde,

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,480
but I'd never do anything

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,560
to harm you or Lin Corporation.

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,200
What was the reason
for you to approach me

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,520
and want Lin Corporation's shares?

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,800
That was just an excuse
I used to stay by your side.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,920
What I've always wanted

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,520
is just you.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,320
Ever since I was hurt
by Ma Chengjun and Wen Lili,

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,920
I stopped trusting anyone.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,800
It was your presence that changed me.

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,840
You were the only person

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,400
I believed in this world.

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,400
But now, I've realized

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
that you've been lying to me.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,040
Lin Yan,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
I know

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,640
that Lin Corporation means a lot to you.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,640
I can't explain
this situation right now,

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,440
but when the time is right, I will…

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
What do you mean by the right time?

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Maybe

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,320
I shouldn't have made you
my bodyguard at first.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,440
I want to make a deal with you.

54
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,680
I can help you
reclaim the Lin Corporation.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,080
(After it's done,)

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,000
I want half of your shares.

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
Why should I trust you?

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
Because in this world,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
only I can help you.

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,480
(Where have you been all these years?)

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
(Why have you suddenly returned?)

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,720
(What's your purpose?)

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,720
(What do you want
Lin Corporation's shares for?)

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
(You don't need to worry about that.)

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,440
(After everything is settled,)

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,200
(I can give you)

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,680
(15% of Lin Corporation's shares.)

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,760
That's quite different
from what I had in mind before.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,000
How you helped my dad before,

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,520
do the same for me now.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,040
(I was Mr. Lin's assistant
and personal bodyguard.)

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
(So, are you meaning)

73
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,440
(that you also want me)

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,280
(to be your all day personal bodyguard?)

75
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,720
(We are only
in a professional relationship.)

76
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,160
(You're just my bodyguard.)

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,720
(You should know where you stand.)

78
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,360
(The shares I promised you,
you don't want them anymore?)

79
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
What I truly want
has never been shares.

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,840
(I want to be your man)

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,680
(to protect you.)

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I've never said this to anyone before,

83
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,480
(and I won't say it)

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,080
(to another woman in my lifetime.)

85
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,640
(Lin Yan,)

86
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
(I like you.)

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,280
Leave.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
Let's never see each other again.

89
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,720
(Don't cry.)

90
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,600
(You can only rely on yourself.)

91
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,080
Change the door to one
made of zinc alloy.

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,840
This one doesn't soundproof well.

93
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,320
Let's upgrade my desk to walnut wood.

94
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,240
It should be classy.

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,520
Add a massage chair.

96
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
From now on,
I'll be handling a lot of work.

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,000
Ma Chengjun,

98
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm satisfied with my office already.

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,720
You don't need to go through
all of this trouble.

100
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,240
Lin Yan, you've misunderstood.

101
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm not redecorating your office.

102
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm redecorating mine.

103
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,160
What do you mean?

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,040
You don't know?

105
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,920
Let me share some good news with you.

106
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,040
I've acquired

107
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,440
55% of Lin Corporation's shares.

108
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,280
Now, I'm the largest shareholder

109
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,280
and in absolute control.

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,760
There won't be a Chairwoman Lin

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,520
[Chairwoman Lin Yan]
in Lin Corporation, just Chairman Ma.

112
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,720
Chairman Ma of Lin Corporation?

113
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,040
Don't you find that humiliating?

114
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,200
That's a good suggestion.

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,440
We should change the name.

116
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,600
Instead of Lin Corporation,

117
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,520
let's call it Ma Corporation.

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,440
Lin Corporation has been emptied out
by you.

119
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,720
It's just an empty shell.

120
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,840
What's the use of buying it?

121
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,000
Because back in the day,

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
your father always looked down on me.

123
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
He always thought I'm useless.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,360
I just want him to see
from the afterlife

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,960
how his beloved Lin Corporation ended up

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,040
in the hands of the person
he despised the most, me!

127
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,840
Ma Chengjun!

128
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,920
Scared me for a moment here.

129
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
But I know

130
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,080
you won't stand by

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,120
and watch Lin Corporation collapse.

132
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
What do you want actually?

133
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
I want you.

134
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
As long as you can be mine,

135
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
I'll spare Lin Corporation.

136
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,480
You're really disgusting, you know that?

137
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
You insult me.

138
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,520
But I've never liked to force anyone.

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Whether to make this deal or not,

140
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
it's up to you.

141
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,400
(No matter where you are,)

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,240
(I'll be there in an instant.)

143
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Help!

144
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,320
Because in this world,

145
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,520
only I can help you.

146
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,690
♪Time, slow it down♪

147
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,660
♪Time, slow it down♪

148
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,920

149

♪Don't let me forget♪

151
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,640
Playing the victim all alone?

152
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,120
What are you up to?

153
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I heard Xiao Mo dumped you.

154
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
I told you before,

155
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,600
that guy's no good.

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,920
With his pretty-boy looks,

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,480
he's probably surrounded by girls.

158
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,320
You had the chance to be Mrs. Ma,

159
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,600
but you chose to be his mistress.

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,640
Are you that shameless?

161
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,480
Get out.

162
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm here today

163
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
to give you one more chance.

164
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
As long as you're willing
to come back to me

165
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
and be my woman,

166
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,840
who knows,

167
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,880
I might just let you be Mrs. Ma again.

168
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,920
Get out!

169
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Or I'll call the cops!

170
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,880
Call them now.

171
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,320
Tomorrow, I'll make sure
Lin Corporation is finished!

172
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,000
You...

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Come.

174
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,480
Give your husband a nice foot massage.

175
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
Did you hear me?

176
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,720
Do you want to do it the hard way?

177
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,840
Let me go!

178
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,840
Don't move.

179
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,240
I'm telling you,

180
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,680
you're a shameless woman.

181
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,560
I'm such an outstanding man
who loves you,

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
but you don't cherish me.

183
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,640
You insist on being
with a lousy bodyguard.

184
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Why hasn't he saved you?

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,560
