2
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,000
We've

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,120
already kidnapped her.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Just do as I said before.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,680
Who sent all of you?

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,320
Listen to me.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
No matter who they are,

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,880
and no matter how much
they're paying you,

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I'll pay you ten times.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,600
Ten times?

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,960
I'll pay you twenty times.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,880
Just let me go.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,880
As long as you let me go,

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,120
I won't hold you responsible.

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,960
Brothers,

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,200
get to work.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,880
What are you doing?

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,240
Don't touch me!

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,960
Don't touch me!

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,720
Are you okay?

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,080
You idiot!

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Keep going.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,360
You bunch of short-sighted fools

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,080
even dare to harm Mr. Xiao's girl.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,800
(Lin Yan.)

26
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,000
(Finish them off.)

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,920
Have a good sleep.

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Don't go.

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
I promise

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,400
I won't let any harm
come to you again in the future.

What are you doing?

54
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,920
Morning.

55
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,080
Do you want to run away?

56
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
Me?

57
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
No.

58
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
You don't want to take responsibility

59
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,560
after having your way
with me last night?

60
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,320
Please, isn't it a woman's loss
in such a situation?

61
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
A man saying these things,
have you no shame?

62
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
Why are you laughing?

63
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,840
You...

64
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
Stop laughing right away.

65
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Last night,

66
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,000
you were quite enthusiastic.

67
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,160
You shut up.

68
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,960
Shut up.

69
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Let me think.

70
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
Who made the first move

71
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
last night?

72
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,000
That's because...

73
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,000
you seduced me.

74
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,360
I prefer the Yan from last night.

75
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,480
I said stop talking about it.

76
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,000
What's the matter?
I haven't gotten out of bed yet.

77
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,000
Where are you going?

78
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,280
Mr. Xiao, who's in your room?

79
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,640
Who are you talking to?

80
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,520
My...

81
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,080
pet.

82
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
Who is your pet?

83
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,200
You.

84
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,240
I heard it.

85
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,120
My sister-in-law.

86
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,120
Mr. Xiao,

87
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,720
when did you two get together?

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Who is his sister-in-law?

89
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
You'd better hang up.

90
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
Did you hear that?

91
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,640
Your sister-in-law is upset.

92
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,680
I have to cheer her up.

93
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,080
Xiao Mo, stop your nonsense!

94
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm not talking nonsense.

95
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm stating the facts.

96
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,080
Just wait.

97
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,680
You should rest at home for a few days.

98
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
Wen Lili wants to take nude photos of me

99
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,160
for blackmail.

100
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
Using such a low trick

101
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
means that she's really desperate.

102
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
Next,

103
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,800
it's time for me to take action.

104
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,040
I declare that

105
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,400
a month from now,

106
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,560
Lin Yan and I will hold the wedding

107
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,120
we should have had a long time ago.

108
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,400
Yan,

109
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,400
marry me.
