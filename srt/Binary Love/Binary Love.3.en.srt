It's the shorthand for 'relax'.

Many people use this method to relax.

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,539
any special meaning?

MMP Bar.

00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:44,955
Tonight?

34
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,550
What are you doing?

35
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,400
Who asked you out for a drink?

36
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,950
None of your business.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,075
Yes. Yes.

38
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,970
MMP?

39
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,820
That's the most famous bar downtown.

40
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,125
Why are you so sensitive
to that kind of information?

41
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,280
Don't ask about

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,159
a Goddess's life.

43
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,180
But you've really grown up.

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,525
You're even going to MMP.

45
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,859
I entered a design competition
on the forum.

46
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:17,979
They will announce the result there.

47
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:20,774
Why would a bar

48
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,735
organize some design competition?

49
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:23,695
I don't know.

50
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:25,614
Anyway, they called me over
to talk about design.

51
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,639
Go to a bar and talk about design.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,039
Boring!

53
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:38,789
I'm leaving.

54
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,789
I'm gonna talk about design.

56

Boss, are you going to the bar?

57
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:03,044
Take me with you.

58
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,044
Not today.

59
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,125
I have something important to do today.

60
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:08,245
What is it?

61
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,960
You even got the hangover cure ready.

62
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,454
Just in case.

63
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:20,374
In case?

64
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:22,374
In case of what?

65
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:26,254
I'm leaving.

66
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,460
That's not right.

67
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,325
Yunjiang Road.

68
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,575
Hello, are you Mr. Xiao?

69

Please.

73
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,100
- Hello, Sir.
- Thank you.

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,059
Do you have a reservation?

75
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:33,619
No.

76
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,580
Well, you can sit...

77
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:36,460
I'll just sit here.

78
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,500
Here is the menu.
What would you like to drink?

79
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:40,839
Your signature drink will be fine.

80
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,075
Okay.

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
(Who is that?)

82
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,279
(Why would Linlin know him?)

83
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:50,805
Today,

84
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,240
I want to talk to you about your design.

85
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,680
I'm very interested in it.

86
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,550
I hope we can cooperate

87
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,160
and put the cup you designed
into production.

88
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,550
Really?

89
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,375
Your drinks, sir.

90
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:12,675
I only ordered one glass.

91
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:14,034
It's two for one today.

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,350
Thanks.

93
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,975
But I only got the third place
in the competition.

94
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
I really like your design.

95
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,879
Alessi Juice.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,959
That juicer

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,525
is the 25th-anniversary limited edition.

98
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,959
I like the designer a lot.

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,419
- Philippe Starck.
- Philippe Starck.

100
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,920
What are they talking about?
They are so happy.

101
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,970
Stark said it was called Salif.

102
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,170
But I don't think

103
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,769
that's where all his inspiration
came from.

104
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,569
I watched a documentary earlier.

105
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,689
There is this little insect

106
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,000
that comes out in the morning
to drink water,

107
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,129
and it needs to raise its legs

108
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,649
so that the water can run down
from the butt to the mouth.

109
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,454
Imagine what aliens would look like

110
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:00,975
through an insect,

111
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:02,814
that is indeed Starck's style.

112
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:03,364
Yeah.

113
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,680
I didn't expect you
to run the bar so well

114
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,950
and know so much about design.

115
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,150
Just a little bit.

116
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,399
However, meeting someone
who I can connect with

117
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,639
is something to be happy about.

118
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,000
I specially prepared two drinks,

119
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,519
one regular

120
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,625
and one non-alcoholic.

121
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,959
Which one do you want?

122
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,399
(You don't know Linlin.)

123
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,279
(Linlin never drinks alcohol.)

124
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,240
Um.

125
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,275
It tastes great.

126
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,519
(Since when did Linlin start drinking?)

127
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,039
Hello.

128
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:02,686
Can I help you?

129
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,259
Do you remember me?

130
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,379
The lab is off-limits.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
Give me back my headband.

132
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,475
Sir.

133
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,360
This is my classmate.
I asked her over for help.

134
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,375
Ye Ruting, from the Department
of Industrial Design.

135
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,550
I didn't ask you.

136
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:58,870
It's your first visit, right?

137
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,521
Let Xie Duanxi show you around.

138
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,200
Okay.

139
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,750
Sir!

140
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,925
Sir.

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
She's a pretty girl.

142
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,960
Take your chance.

143
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,475
No, Sir. You've misunderstood.

144
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,675
It's not what you think it is.

145
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,875
I've been there before.

146
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,300
I got it. I got it.

147
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,259
Sir, it's not like that.

148
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:21,899
I got it. I got it.

149
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,909
Botanist.

150
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,909
Come help me.

151
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,350
Done.

152
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,529
Tie up my hair for me.

153
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,150
Done.

154
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:22,965
You are skilled.

155
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,205
Do you have a girlfriend?

156
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,575
I've only tied plants before.

157
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,600
I see.

158
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
Just don't make a fast knot next time.

159
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,805
You can't go in here!

160
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,205
I'll wait for your results.

161
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:18,830
Okay.

162
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:21,100
Don't put limits on yourself.

163
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,700
Sir.

164
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,580
It's from Starck.

165
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:24,404
- Rest assured. Wait for my good news.
- Are you all right, sir?

166
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,600
- Okay. I'll wait for the good news.
- Sir.

167
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,200
Fang Yuke?

168
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,244
What are you doing here?

169
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,935
Why are you so drunk?

170
