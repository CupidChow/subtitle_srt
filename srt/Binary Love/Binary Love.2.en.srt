00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,470
(First prize of National English Competition)
First prize for English.

335
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,075
(First prize of National Physics Competition)
First prize for Physics.

336
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,559
First prize for Chemistry.

337
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,075
Must they be put up, too?

338
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,119
No, no.

339
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,675
My mother packed them by mistake,
I guess.

340
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,440
I hate to see such certificates.

341
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,359
I thought I was a student
of competitions.

342
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,700
But I was only
a municipal top scorer in NCEE.

343
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:06,825
Municipal top scorer?

344
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,250
Let me introduce you.

345
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,095
This is Wang Jie, our roommate.

346
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:13,294
She's awesome.

347
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:15,175
She's a provincial top scorer
of science.

348
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:16,575
Nice to meet you.

349
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:19,945
The girl opposite me is
a municipal top scorer.

350
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,544
The girl next to her is
a provincial top scorer.

351
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,984
I'm Zhou Linlin who came here by luck.

352
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,350
The last girl hasn't come yet, right?

353
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,400
Ye Ruting in Class 2
of Industrial Design.

354
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,279
But I don't think she'll live here.

355
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,625
She's a native, after all.

356
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,039
She's quite a great girl.

357
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,975
I've heard about her.

358
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,440
She won many English competitions.

359
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,559
I also heard from some seniors

360
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,640
that she was voted the Prettiest Girl
of our department by all students

361
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,450
within five minutes
after she registered.

362
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,275
I use the same notebook.

363
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,960
This notebook is

364
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,550
of good quality.

365
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,600
I...

366
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,100
I'll use it to write plans
for my college life.

367
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:03,759
What about you guys?

368
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,450
Any plans for the next four years?

369
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,075
I plan to pass the IELTS

370
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:08,115
and take further courses
at ENSBA in Paris.

371
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,269
Paris?

372
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,229
I've even got a French name for myself.

373
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,550
Juliette.

374
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:16,530
I plan

375
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,675
to get a doctor's degree before I'm 29.

376
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,050
If possible,

377
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,799
(Ten-year Plans)
I hope I can get married

378
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,675
when I write the doctoral dissertation.

379
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,525
Before you're 29?

380
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:30,805
What about you, Linlin?

381
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:31,964
Me?

382
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:34,005
I haven't got any plans yet.

383
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:35,325
Besides learning industrial design,

384
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:36,525
I only want to find someone.

385
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,920
Someone?

386
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,125
Who?

387
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:46,444
Come on, Ding,

388
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,924
Focus on teamwork, will you?

389
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:48,805
We can barely hang in there.

390
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:50,045
Do something!

391
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,124
What are you waiting for?

392
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:52,725
I'm waiting for Fang Yuke.

393
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,525
He's said to be a genius
of computer science

394
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,805
and the top scorer of science
of Yaodong Province.

395
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,355
Who isn't a top scorer?

396
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,625
I'm not.

397
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:01,344
Everybody but you.

398
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,404
You know what?

399
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:04,204
The second place

400
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:05,275
knows that someone is better than him.

401
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,684
But the first place doesn't.

402
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:07,964
Maybe Fang Yuke is the one

403
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,025
who does better than you.

404
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:16,425
There you are, Genius Fang.

405
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,064
I'm Ding. He's Big Mouth.

406
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:20,465
We'll be a family.

407
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,820
INSEC Battle?
[*INSEC: Information Security]

408
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,000
Right.

409
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:36,740
It's the tradition of our department.

410
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:37,980
Those sophomores

411
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,139
blocked our access to the Internet.

412
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,650
Unless we unblock it,

413
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:42,824
we won't be accepted
by the Department of Computer Science.

414
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,185
How is this possible?

415
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,824
No generation of freshmen
have ever succeeded.

416
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,325
(I can't hold it anymore.)

417
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:54,285
(My computer is about to explode.)

418
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:55,724
(They're operating so fast.)

419
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:57,575
(They're exactly showing off.)

420
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,244
I couldn't hold it a long time ago.

421
00:25:59,244 --> 00:26:00,250
Oh, no, no, no.

422
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,164
Blue screen errors.

423
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,250
Genius, help us, please.

424
00:26:16,694 --> 00:26:17,415
What is the login password?

425
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,014
54088KUIT.

426
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:41,400
It's back to normal.

427
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,279
Who is he?

428
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,775
Genius Fang, my roommate.

429
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:57,975
Look.

430
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,600
He got back our rights.
We have access now.

431
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,440
Yes, we do.

432
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,200
Terrific.

433
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,125
We have access now.

434
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,960
Can our laptops function, too?

435
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,925
- Go check it out.
- Yeah.

436
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:10,160
- Go check it out.
- Go, go, go.

437
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,599
Hurry. Hurry.

438
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,600
Remember. He's Genius Fang in our dorm.

439
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,279
Genius,

440
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:17,039
throughout history,

441
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,359
this is the first time
that a freshman unblocked it

442
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,079
and got back access to the Internet.

443
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,175
I... I even witnessed that.

444
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:26,846
What do you think, top scorer?

445
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,096
Genius,

446
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,440
you'll be our boss.

447
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,519
If I could do everything,

448
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,120
why would I still learn
computer science?

449
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:43,005
Hello, I'm Wang Yu.

450
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:44,605
You can also call me Big Mouth.

451
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:55,325
Nice to meet you.

452
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:57,075
I'm Fang Yuke.

453
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,615
So,

454
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:02,175
all clues are gone?

455
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:03,476
Yes.

456
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:04,774
I have to try something else.

457
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:10,064
You can't have more clues
unless you stay.

458
00:28:10,504 --> 00:28:12,544
If you can't pass the replacement test,

459
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:14,304
you'll lose all clues.

460
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,465
Replacement test?

461
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:18,225
Mm.

462
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:19,784
A tradition of Southern University.

463
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:20,744
A replacement test

464
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,705
to clear out those who came by luck.

465
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,125
Don't you even know that?

466
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:26,945
I didn't take that into account.

467
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:36,905
Failing proportionately?

468
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:39,665
10% of the freshmen will fail?

469
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,225
Don't worry.

470
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:43,064
If you fail one exam, you'll only
be transferred to another department.

471
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:44,264
You won't be thrown out
unless you fail two exams.

472
00:28:44,744 --> 00:28:45,504
Don't worry?

473
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:47,145
This test will just clear out

474
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:48,900
the poorest students like me.

475
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:53,705
Shall we study together
in the library tomorrow?

476
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:54,945
Good idea.

477
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:04,959
Quickly.

478
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,450
We have only three minutes left!

479
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,200
A poor student like me
has to make an early start.

480
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,559
Otherwise, I would be cleared out.

481
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,239
Come on,

482
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,840
I haven't washed my face yet.

483
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,700
Run!

484
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,239
Where shall I start?

485
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,479
Here it is.

486
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,039
I consulted a senior.

487
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,319
She said the test wouldn't be difficult.

488
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,959
All we need to do is

489
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,239
work out all the previous questions.

490
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,680
Over twenty questions in total.

491
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,850
Come on.

492
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,375
(Do Not Disturb)

493
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:52,800
Oh, I see.

494
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:57,865
You can't work it out by looking.

495
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,725
I'm studying.

496
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:02,225
Could you stay away?

497
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:03,544
I'm helping you.

498
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:08,325
Stop talking in the self-study room.
