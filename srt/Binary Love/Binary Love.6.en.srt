I am Genius Yu.

(12 hours ago)

22
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,080
I just like the bossy CEO style.

23
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,719
Yeah.

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,599
Bossy CEO.

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
What is he doing here?

26
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,919
Having the class with you, obviously.

27
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,000
Where are you going? Aren't you curious?

28
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm never curious
about my friend's admirer.

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,400
We should at least help him. Go.

30
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,520
Move in. Move in. Go.

31
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,599
We need two seats.

32
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,919
Don't you take your own classes?

33
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,199
I'm interested in design classes, too.

34
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,960
Hello, class.

35
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,360
This is your first specialized course.

36
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,360
(Southern University)
I'm your teacher for this course.

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,600
(Southern University)
My name is Gu Xijue.

38
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,280
You can call me Mr. Gu.

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
Before starting today's class,

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120
I have a question for you.

41
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,319
What do you think is
the essence of design?

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,759
Here you go.

43
00:03:57,675 --> 00:03:58,439
As defined

44
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,919
by ICSID, [*ICSID: International Center
for Settlement of Investment Disputes]

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,080
industrial design aims
to establish various qualities

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,199
for articles, processes, services,

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,439
and the systems built

48
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,319
during their life cycles.

49
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,375
Sit down, please.

50
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,199
Good.

51
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,960
A standard answer.

52
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,199
But it's not what I expected.

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,120
Anyone else?

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,480
No one? Then I'll pick someone.

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,400
Let's have Zhou Linlin,

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,120
the most famous student
of our department,

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,680
answer this question.

58
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,240
Mr. Gu, I...

59
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,480
If you don't like this question,

60
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
how about another one?

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,000
Tell me.

62
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,959
What sort of man is Fang Yuke?

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,439
Thanks, Mr. Gu,

64
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,959
but I prefer the first question.

65
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,959
Convenience, optimization,

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,839
and people-oriented nature are
the essence of our major.

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920
But I think

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,519
we can do more than the design.

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,120
The products we design

70
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,680
can also be friends of users.

71
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,279
They will accompany the users,

72
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,439
listen to their feelings,

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
offer help, and make things easier

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
when necessary.

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,000
They can also show people

76
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,839
that life can be

77
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,879
more interesting.

78
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,439
Good point. Be seated, please.

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
Who is your favorite designer?

80
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,279
Philippe Starck.

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
Starck...

82
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,279
He has a master class
in Paris this year.

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,839
If you're interested,

84
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,680
try signing up for it.

85
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,360
Okay.

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,800
Sorry, sir, I'm late.

87
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,079
Come on in.

88
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,480
This is getting good.

89
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
Excuse me.

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,639
Is this seat occupied?

91
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,279
Are you blind?

92
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,120
Do me a favor, please.

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
Come on.

94
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,399
It's not occupied.

95
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,399
He's Linlin's admirer.

96
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,680
We should at least help him.

97
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,519
You just said that.

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,319
Fine.

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,170
Mm.

100
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,160
This seat isn't occupied.

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,240
Thank you.

102
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,639
Let me help you.

103
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,680
Where are you going?

104
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,439
Sitting here will disturb my study.

105
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,920
(Design Basics)

106
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,680
The boy who just came in, waste no time.

107
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,650
Get a seat.

108
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
Linlin, long time no see.

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,360
Didn't you just see me last night?

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,759
I did?

111
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,759
But I feel that I haven't seen you
for a long time.

112
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,480
It's a class of our major.

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,519
Why are you guys here?

114
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm here to accompany you.

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,720
It's my new elective course.

116
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,439
What about him? What is he doing here?

117
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,279
It's the class for my second degree.

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,519
Aren't I supposed to be here?

119
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,879
This is the course of Design Basics.

120
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,920
But today, I want you

121
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,879
to experience

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,800
what fast design is.

123
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,040
What do you think it is?

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,319
Here you go.

125
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
Fast design means

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,480
expressing ideas and intentions

127
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,079
by drawing

128
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,279
in a very short time

129
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
and making a design

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,279
that reflects the design philosophy

131
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,639
and concept.

132
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,639
Sit down, please.

133
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,959
In plain words,

134
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,600
based on the given theme,

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,079
you offer as many possible proposals

136
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,079
as you can in a set time.

137
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,639
Today, the theme is the cup,

138
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,639
the most common object in daily life.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,319
Do the sketch in whatever way you want,

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,360
as long as you can express your ideas.

141
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,639
In this way, I can

142
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,040
have a basic understanding

143
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
of your design thinking,
basics, and ideas

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,199
for grouping you later.

145
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,120
Thank you.

146
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,920
Linlin, lend me
a piece of paper, please.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
Be creative.

148
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,079
You have 30 minutes.

149
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,439
Get started. Make haste.

150
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,319
Due to the high temperature

151
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
and lack of water,

152
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,959
we'll adjust these two seedlings later.

153
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,650
Mr. Zhu.

154
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,120
Aren't you on duty today?

155
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,000
What did you come here for?

156
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,320
I guess my hosta flowers
are about to bloom today.

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,399
I came to check on them.

158
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,550
Okay.

159
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,600
This one looks good.

160
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,639
Zhou Linlin.

161
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,279
She designed six different cups

162
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,240
within only 30 minutes.

163
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,240
Details are marked for each cup, too.

164
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,039
It can be one of the best designs

165
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,320
even of the whole department.

166
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,519
No wonder they two
want to sit beside you.

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,559
Class, learn from Zhou Linlin.

168
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,679
Here's an interesting design
from another student.

169
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,879
Fang Yuke.

170
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,080
Tell us about your design.

171
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,080
Mr. Gu,

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
I can't draw, actually.

173
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,519
But I'm familiar with UI design.
[*UI: User interface]

174
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
Especially on smartphones,

175
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,080
UI design must give full consideration

176
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,679
to its usability and user experience.

177
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,600
It perfectly coincides

178
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,320
with the people-oriented demand
of industrial design.

179
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
So, after permuting three basic figures,

180
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,279
I designed the cups
as if they were icons.

181
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,600
That's how I designed the cups.

182
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,679
Sit down, please.

183
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,080
Looks like a student from another major

184
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,200
can also offer

185
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,879
totally different ideas.

186
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,000
Here are some negative examples, too.

187
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,600
For example, Wen Tao.

188
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,475
Here.

189
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,440
You had quite an abstract design.

190
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,840
Mr. Gu, my design is in the folds.

191
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,700
I thought I just didn't get your point.

192
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,279
This?

193
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,750
Right.

194
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,759
It's too small to be seen clearly.

195
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,320
Mr. Gu, I really can't draw.

196
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,600
But I can learn.

197
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,000
Fine. Now that you can't draw at all,

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
team up with Zhou Linlin.

199
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:39,600
Ah?

200
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay. Okay.

201
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,559
A good student will team up
with a poor student.

202
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,279
See? A straight-A student
can't always get what he wants.

203
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,750
Sometimes, you should learn
to be vulnerable.

204
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,120
You don't need to learn.

205
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,925
You're indeed vulnerable.

206
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,759
You watered the flowers
four or five times.

207
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,150
If you continue,
the flowers will be drowned.

208
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,360
Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Zhu.

209
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,879
Go water the flowers in there.

210
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,759
But I watered them yesterday.

211
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,750
If you go in there,
you can't see the gate.

212
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,919
Fine. I'm out of here. You carry on.

Linlin, eat more.

Linlin doesn't eat carrots.

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,120
Carrots are nutritious.

They're good for health.

261

Zhou Linlin can eat whatever she wants.

Excuse me, but may I decide

what I eat?

Am I a PE student?

Was I born yesterday?

270
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,279
You don't mean to discuss the topic.

271
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,320
I gotta go.

272
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,679
Neither of you shall follow me.

273
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,175
Linlin.

274
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,240
Linlin, I'm sorry.

275
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,700
I shouldn't have annoyed you at lunch.

276
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,720
I quite agree.

277
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,039
He's the kind of man

278
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,600
who just likes controlling others.

279
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm to blame, too.

280
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,919
I shouldn't have argued with him.

281
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,399
I'm not annoyed.

282
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,480
I just want you not to quarrel.

283
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,679
You didn't eat much at lunch.

284
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,120
I bought some porridge.

285
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,759
Don't eat the bread. Have some porridge.

286
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,279
Why must she have porridge?
She isn't sick.

287
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,325
Linlin,

288
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,840
I bought some fried chicken
at the school gate.

289
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,919
It tastes great.

290
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,480
I don't want it. I'm full already.

291
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,440
Put the food away.

now that you're not annoyed,

294
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,720
shall we go play the escape room?

295
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,480
There's a new horror
escape room downtown.

296
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,360
It's highly praised
without any negative feedback.

Mr. Gu assigned this morning.

300
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,799
When I was reading here,

301
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,519
I made several proposals

302
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,480
for our design of this semester.

303
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:01,960
Check them out.

304
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:04,640
Linlin,

305
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,240
a little question

306
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,640
just hit me.

307
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,240
What is Starck's master class

308
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,480
that your classmates talked about?

309
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,960
Starck is a French industrial designer.

310
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,200
If you're really interested
in industrial design,

311
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,319
spend some more time on it.

312
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,519
Linlin, do you want to visit France?

313
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,480
I don't want to visit France.

314
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,480
I just want to take his master class.

315
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,279
But it's hard to be admitted.

316
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,519
His class is way too popular.

317
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,920
I can't reach it even if I tiptoe.

318
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,279
If you can't,

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,759
They...

337
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,920
These proposals aren't important.

338
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,799
The direction is seriously flawed.

339
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,680
I got it wrong before.

340
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,599
Anyway, nothing

341
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,640
should be continued

342
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,440
towards the wrong direction.

343
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
We can't make it right

344
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,200
unless we admit our errors
before it's too late.

345
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
What do you think, Fang Yuke?

346
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,519
Linlin is right.

347
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,000
But before changing the direction,

348
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,279
we need some new inspirations.

349
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,519
Linlin,

350
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,400
why not go to the escape room?

351
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,559
She said she didn't want to go.

352
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,240
When did I say that?

353
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,079
I'll go. Right today.

354
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,839
That's great, Linlin. I'll go with you.

355
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,300
I'll go, too.

356
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,960
Why are we going
to the escape room in such a hurry?

357
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,559
I've got a study plan
for this afternoon.

358
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,480
After you knew he was Genius Yu,

359
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,400
why didn't you expose him to his face?

360
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,440
He knows I've been looking for Genius Yu

361
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,599
and he just doesn't admit it.

362
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,319
He indeed helped me.

363
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
But I really don't understand

364
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,175
why he couldn't tell me the truth.

365
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,079
He deceived me and I won't let him go.

366
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,559
But isn't it a problem
between you and him?

367
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,720
What does it have to do with Wen Tao?

368
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,640
During our group discussion,

369
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,720
Wen Tao suggested the game.

370
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,000
I couldn't stop him from going.

371
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,799
Wen Tao is a good man, I assume.

372
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,440
He's among the best men
of my data analysis.

373
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,920
Stop, stop.

374
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Let's get back to the point, okay?

375
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,119
You said you wanted to punish Fang Yuke?

376
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,119
No problem. Why don't we

377
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:01,880
just play tough?

378
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,880
How will you punish him
in the escape room?

379
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
He's awesome in all aspects.

380
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,480
But he has a weakness.
He's afraid of ghosts.

381
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,350
Hey.

382
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,480
What are you doing?
You freaked me out!

383
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,480
Boss, you're way too timid.

384
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,640
What...

385
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,900
What are you watching?

386
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,625
Linlin invited me to the escape room.

387
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,240
I'm doing some homework.

388
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,720
Escape...

389
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,200
Escape room?

390
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,960
When a timid man like you
goes to the escape room,

391
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,640
Zhou Linlin has to protect you instead.

392
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
Come on.

393
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,960
Linlin invited me.

394
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,119
I won't turn her down.

395
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,000
When she wants to play,
I'll go with her.

396
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,880
As long as I get to know

397
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,079
about the design of the game,

398
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,799
I won't be that scared.

399
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,559
What's worse,

400
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,079
Wen Tao will go, too.

401
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,920
Who?

402
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,440
Wen Tao.

403
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,200
The man with abs? He...

404
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,550
Boss, let me go with you.

405
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,119
This semester didn't begin
a long time ago,

406
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,759
but I've been quite familiar

407
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,200
with pleasure-seeking.

408
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,799
I know a lot about the escape room.

409
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,759
Instead of watching the videos,

410
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,319
listening to a player like you

411
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,160
would enlighten me faster.

412
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,319
That's right.

413
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,160
Good job, Ding.

414
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,960
Let me explain to you. First...

415
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,160
What are you talking so happily about?

416
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,640
Why not share the happiness with me?

417
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,255
(Ying Room, Immersive Theater)

418
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,079
Let's assign our missions.

419
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:38,960
What missions?

420
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,519
Do you really think

421
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,039
we're here to play the game only?

422
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,650
You know what?

423
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,480
We must create opportunities

424
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,079
to make Boss and Zhou Linlin stay alone.

425
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,160
Then we'll catch Wen Tao.

426
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,975
Mm.

427
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,359
Where are you going?

428
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:58,720
To catch Wen Tao.

429
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,480
Are you silly, boy?

430
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,079
When we enter the room,
we shall get a chance

431
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,319
to trap Wen Tao.

432
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,865
Mm.

433
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,160
Is Fang Yuke really that timid?

434
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,440
He doesn't appear to be timid.

435
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,799
Let's find out.

436
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:21,839
Have you brought that thing?

437
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:25,319
Yes.

438
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,400
Hello. Tickets for seven.

439
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,250
Thank you.

440
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,519
Here are your keys.

441
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,319
Thank you.

442
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,799
Linlin, don't worry.

443
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,200
I'll protect you.

444
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,625
Are you scared?

445
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,519
If you are scared, just quit.

446
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm here for her, anyway.

447
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,559
I'm not scared.

448
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
Fine, then. No one shall escape today.

449
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,079
Come and get your tickets.

450
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,759
Okay.

451
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,720
Who?

452
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,799
Who's there?

453
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:24,581
This way. This way.

454
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,200
Hurry, bro.

455
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,480
What did you scream for? Cowards.

456
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,150
Calm down. I'm Zhu Li.
Can't you recognize me?

457
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,720
Run!

458
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
Zhu Li, what happened?

459
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,279
Don't move. Don't move.

460
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,759
Linlin, run!

461
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,119
I'm here with you. Don't be scared.

462
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,525
Let go of me.

463
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,640
There you are.

464
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,050
Are you the director of this part?

465
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,160
I...

466
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,640
I have something to feed back.

467
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,000
We have to identify the patterns, right?

468
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,000
But the third sound and the fifth sound

469
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,279
are actually different.

470
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,440
What are you talking about?

471
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,440
Are you questioning me?

472
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,559
Come on. Be seated.

473
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,720
Today,

474
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,119
I must get this straight.

475
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,799
MC, standing for Morse Code,

476
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,240
consists of binary numbers.

477
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,880
(Map of the second floor)
It was created in 1837.

478
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,119
Linlin, are you all right?

479
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,039
Why did you tag along?

480
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,240
Dude, are you a sports guy?

481
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,000
Where's Linlin?

482
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,700
Who's Linlin?

483
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
How shall we get back?

484
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,559
I feel a little bit dizzy now.

485
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,720
Don't talk to me.

486
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,225
I don't know where we are, either.

487
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,825
Don't be scared.

488
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:49,079
It's okay. It's okay.

489
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,039
I think he left.

490
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,319
Stay right here.

491
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,119
I'll go check if he has left.

492
00:28:57,675 --> 00:28:58,400
Linlin.

493
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,079
Linlin.

494
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,440
He left.

495
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,079
Linlin?

496
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,559
You deceived me for years.

497
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,039
Taking revenge once isn't out of line.

498
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
Why did you come back?

499
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,750
There's a ghost in the room.

500
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,275
Then why are you back?

501
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,640
In case you're scared.

502
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,000
What are you waiting for? Go.

503
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,119
Put me down!

504
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,160
Harder, Ding.

505
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,025
She's stuck. I'm so worn out.

506
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,200
What were you doing?

507
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,640
What are you laughing at?

508
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,039
What are you laughing at?

509
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Oh, no! Her voice deafened me.

510
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,440
I can't hear anything.

511
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,799
She said she liked you!

512
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,200
I can't count on you.

513
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,319
What did she say?

514
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,720
I can't hear anything at all!

515
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,119
My makeup is messed up!

516
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:41,575
I spent three hours on that!

517
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,839
That is a simple question.

518
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,440
Don't make the same mistake again.

519
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,079
We're terribly sorry.

520
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,559
Some free tickets for you.

521
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,279
Welcome again to find out the bugs.

522
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:19,799
Are you all right?

523
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,559
I am.

524
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,640
I have something to tell you.

525
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,279
Fine. At half past nine tonight,

526
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,279
see you on the rooftop
of Building No. 7.

527
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,300
Okay.

528
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,240
I'll be waiting for you there.

529
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,275
Mm.

530
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,519
Well, I...

531
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,100
Linlin.

532
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,875
Boss.

533
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:13,839
What took you so long?

534
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,960
Back in there,

535
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,000
I made friends with someone.

536
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,599
I should go.

537
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,240
Linlin,

538
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,640
I have some confusion
about the class this morning.

539
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,240
Could you teach me later?

540
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,480
But I've got something to do tonight.

541
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,880
With whom?

542
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,950
Alone.

543
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,150
Come on. Let's go.

544
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,400
Go.

545
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,825
It's okay.

546
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:37,900
Don't look in the mirror.

547
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,400
Wang Jie, where is Linlin going tonight?

548
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,900
The rooftop of Building No. 7.

549
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,440
Thanks a lot.

550
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,920
Why is she going to the rooftop so late?

551
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,559
And alone?

552
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,599
Wait a minute.

553
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,150
Alone?

554
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
She'll go alone?

555
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,000
I didn't expect the escape room
to be so exciting.

556
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,440
Are you sure?

557
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,079
I nearly shouted myself hoarse.

558
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,440
But you think it's exciting?

559
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,240
And I'm walking in the rain now.
It sucks.

560
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,160
By the way,

561
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,680
what about Fang Yuke?

562
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,599
Did you scare him?

563
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,750
Yes, kind of.

564
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,640
What does that mean?

565
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,519
I did scare him

566
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,799
and he ran away.

567
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,000
But he returned

568
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,759
in case I felt scared.

569
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,100
Then I didn't have the heart
to continue.

570
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,799
Good for you, girl.

571
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,400
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

572
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,319
What? Have you cooled down?

573
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,599
I haven't, of course.

574
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,279
Fang Yuke is so annoying.

575
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,000
No trick can work on him.

576
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,800
It's okay.

577
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,159
I have some free tickets.

578
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,320
We can go there again.

579
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,300
No, thanks.

580
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,199
He has something to tell me tonight.

581
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,440
I'll first hear him out

582
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,239
before I make a new decision.

583
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,480
But it's already raining.

584
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,360
How will you go to the rooftop?

585
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,440
It's just raining.

586
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,519
Even if it snowed, I would also go.

587
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,440
Go.

588
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,760
Leave the umbrella to me, please.

589
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,199
Be careful how you answer.

590
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,280
I...

591
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,840
Tomorrow, reply to me
in the greenhouse.

592
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,675
(Phone & WeChat: 15867512729)

593
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,360
I'm worn out.

594
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,719
Ruting is coming back soon.

595
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,679
Shall we wait for her to watch
The Romance of Tiger and Rose?

596
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,800
Then we can get closer.

597
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,320
I won't watch it with you.

598
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,639
I've got some business. Gotta go.

599
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:22,450
Mm.

600
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,600
Let's watch it alone.

601
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,225
Okay.

602
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,960
Hello.

603
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,639
Ruting, you're back?

604
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,599
Yeah.

605
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,079
It's my first time to meet you
in the dorm after school started.

606
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,119
Some presents for you.

607
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,400
What are they?

608
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,159
This is for you.

609
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:39,800
Thank you.

610
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,700
- Here.
- Thank you.

611
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,199
- Thank you.
- I didn't know you too much.

612
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,880
You're quite generous.

613
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
It's not too late to know about me now.

614
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,199
When we have time, let's talk more

615
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,679
and know more about each other.

616
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,320
For example,

617
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,199
Zhou Linlin,

618
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,920
what's your relationship
with Xie Duanxi?

619
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,960
We're in no relationship.

620
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,880
At the ball,

621
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,280
you stuck to Xie Duanxi.

622
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,360
What did you try to ask?

623
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:09,920
Oh, I see.

624
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,599
You don't want to know more about me,

625
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,639
but Xie Duanxi.

626
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,250
You like him, right?

627
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,875
Yes, I like him.

628
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,000
Let me make it clear.

629
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,440
You don't have to
feel competitive with me.

630
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,920
I'm not interested in him at all.

631
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm glad that we can make this clear.

632
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,559
I appreciate your frankness.

633
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:32,000
I made the right decision
to return to the dorm.

634
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,199
Ruting, you want to chase Xie Duanxi?

635
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,519
Let me teach you something.

636
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,239
To chase a man...

637
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,325
Ruting doesn't need
your instructions, okay?

638
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:42,159
Zhou Linlin,

639
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,280
you're smarter than I imagined.

640
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,079
Welcome back.

641
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,199
From this day on, we're roommates.

642
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:50,075
Mm.

643
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,225
(Xie Duanxi: Are you coming
to the greenhouse tonight?)

644
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:55,705
(Are you coming
to the greenhouse tonight?)

645
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,679
All right. I've got business.
I gotta go.

646
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,079
This weekend, I'll treat you
to a big dinner.

647
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:04,000
Mm.

648
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,559
Okay.

649
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,400
- I'm leaving.
- Fine.

650
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,599
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

651
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,159
- I'm leaving, too. Bye.
- Mm.

652
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,599
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

653
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,475
Shall we continue?

654
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,400
You're quite optimistic.

655
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,750
Fine. Let's start
with the fourth episode.

656
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,325
Mm.

657
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,800
Could you do something?

658
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,519
Wait a second.
I'm watching the critical scene.

659
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,760
What critical scene?

660
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
You even knew the ending, didn't you?

661
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
Even time I watch it,
I have new feelings.

662
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,360
And I still can't believe

663
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,639
that such a romantic thing

664
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,480
will happen to Tao.

665
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,920
It will happen to Tao.

666
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,960
What does that have to do with you?

667
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,679
Guys, could you stop?

668
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,880
Come and check if anything is missing.

669
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,000
You've checked it many times, Tao.

670
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,280
Stop for a rest.

671
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,440
No way.

672
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,159
This is the first official date

673
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,519
for Linlin and me.

674
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,199
Everything must be perfect.

675
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,320
Tao made sense.

676
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,920
As in romantic dramas,

677
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,480
the first date between the couple

678
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,840
must be magnificent.

679
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,320
The more magnificent it is,

680
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,480
the stronger the chemistry grows.

681
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:12,960
So, in my opinion,

682
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
everything is ready, but the admirer.

683

Tao,

684
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,119
he and I will take care of this place.

685
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,075
Why don't you go get prepared?

686
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,599
You sound quite experienced.

687
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,960
I'll go take a bath, then.

688
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,320
After you light all the candles,
leave early.

689
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:25,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

690
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm leaving.

691
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,119
Move it.

Yes, he's out.

Oh.

Hello, sir.

721
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,750
This semester, I take your course
on The principle of Microcomputer.

722
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:55,840
Any problem?

723
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,679
May I not attend the classes?

724
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,519
But what will you do instead?

725

I'll take classes for the second degree.

Oh.

727
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,880
The principle of Microcomputer is
a basic course.

But many students fail it.

According to the course arrangement

Don't worry, sir.
