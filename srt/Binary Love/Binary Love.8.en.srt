Zhou Linlin's birthday.

171
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,919
We took a taxi first, and then a bus,

172
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,080
and then a train,

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,600
following them all the way here.

174
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,425
Do you mean they are here
to help Wen Tao?

175
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:40,650
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,679
Is Wen Tao also here?

177
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,000
Well...

178
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,025
I think so.

179
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,559
I think he is here.

180
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,720
Are you the one

181
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,960
who was staring at me on the train?

182
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,600
My friend, how do you know
my surname is Ding?

183
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,879
Who said I know that?

184
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,799
I knew it.

185
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,120
These two people
have been thievish-looking

186
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,679
the whole way.

187
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,039
No, you...

188
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,720
Stop it.

189
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,240
They are Fang Yuke's men.

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,559
It's normal for them to do such things.

191
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:31,919
You...

192
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,720
Isn't this one great?

193
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,000
It's too dark.

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,639
Yeah?

195
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,519
Linlin.

196
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,279
Why are you all here?

197
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:37,919
I'm back.

198
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,159
Didn't you go fishing with my dad?

199
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,080
Where is my dad?

200
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,286
Uncle went home first.

201
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
How do you know we are here?

202
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,075
Let me deposit your suitcase
over there first.

203
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,525
Give it to me!

204
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:54,919
Give it to me!

205
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,440
Linlin!

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,775
It's the Golden Week.
Tents can be sold out easily.

207
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,175
Let's go over there first.

208
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,600
Let's go.

209
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:03,625
- Let's go, Linlin.
- Let's go.

210
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,600
Our suitcases.

211
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,279
We'll take yours!

212
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,720
Let's go.

213
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,879
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

214
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,000
Botanist.

215
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,960
I've booked an RV. It's over there.

216
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,325
Where are your roommates?

217
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,159
They...

218
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,159
They'll be here tomorrow.

219
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,960
Aren't they your roommates?

220
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,399
Yeah.

221
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,120
They arrived early.

222
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,650
Oh.

223
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,440
Why don't you
put your luggage in the RV first?

224
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm gonna go there and say hi to them.

225
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,559
I'll go with you.

226
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,450
Okay.

227
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,450
How to do this?

228
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm so tired.

229
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,875
Why do we have to
set up the tent on our own?

230
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:52,639
Linlin.

231
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,240
I wish we could
stay in that RV over there.

232
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,519
Okay.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
8,000 for one night.

234
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,159
8,000?

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,919
That's unbelievable.

236
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,639
Who would live there?

237
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,519
Linlin!

238
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:11,750
Hey.

239
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,000
I think someone is calling you.

240
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,120
Ruting?

241
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,250
Isn't she supposed to be
in the greenhouse with Xie Duanxi?

242
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,250
Sisters!

243
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,039
How did you get here early?

244
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,175
Well...

245
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:28,400
I miss you guys so much!

246
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,399
We got here on time.

247
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,480
How did you get here early

248
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,039
without telling me?

249
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,919
That's not what friends would do.

250
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
Well, you didn't tell us, either.

251
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,759
Did you get the time wrong?

252
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,875
That's why you're here now?

253
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,480
Yes.

254
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,039
Well,

255
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,480
to commemorate our first trip together,

256
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,080
let's take a picture.

257
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

258
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,879
Did you lie to Xie Duanxi

259
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,120
and need us to act with you?

260
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,480
I can't explain it in a short time.

261
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,279
Pull this off for me
if you're my good sisters.

262
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,720
Okay, I'm born to act.

263
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,720
Are you gonna live with us?

264
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,759
I'll live in the RV over there.

265
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,559
What?

266
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,400
Go away.

267
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,120
I'll invite you to live in an RV

268
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,679
with me next time.

269
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,759
Sure! What took you so long?

270
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,320
We've been waiting for you!
I miss you so much!

271
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,525
Yeah, my good sister.

272
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,759
What

273
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,159
are you doing here?

274
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,825
I'm on a field trip to the forest base.

275
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,320
Ruting is here

276
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,360
to spend the vacation with Linlin.

277
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,200
White legs, even whiter than mine.

278
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,879
You're Zhu... Zhu...

279
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,480
Zhu Li!

280
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,800
Wang Jie!

281
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,279
We're going to take pictures over there.

282
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:22,919
You wanna join us?

283
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,759
Sure. Of course.

284
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

285
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,240
Okay. Let's do it.

286
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,519
Do you want to play volleyball?

287
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,159
No volleyball. We said

288
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,600
we are going to take pictures.

289
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,840
It's been a busy morning.

290
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
I haven't introduced myself yet.

291
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,750
Hi, I'm Goddess Julie.

292
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,919
Hello, I'm Wang Jie,
Zhou Linlin's roommate.

293
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm Lin Ze, Tao's roommate.

294
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,320
I'm also Tao's roommate.
My name is Chen Chen.

295
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,639
Are you going to play volleyball?

296
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,039
Can you count us in?

297
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,675
We can teach you if you want.

298
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,279
How do you...?

299
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
You don't have to teach us.

300
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,919
We just want to see you play.

301
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,519
That's not what you said.

302
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,200
We are supposed to take pictures.

303
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,639
I can keep score for you.

304
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,360
I'll go get my notebook right now.

305
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,875
Of course.

306
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,950
Do you like it here?

307
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,125
Yes.

308
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,359
I don't even remember

309
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,525
the last time I went to see the sea.

310
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,680
The beach over there is beautiful.

311
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,640
You can see the rocks line up

312
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,000
on the sea.

313
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,599
Do you want to check it out?

314
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Right now?

315
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,240
Linlin!

316
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,119
Have you ever
ridden a water scooter before?

317
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,240
Let me take you to ride it.

318
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,119
It's really exciting.

319
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,640
We have made an appointment

320
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
to take a walk on the beach over there.

321
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,799
What would you walk on the beach?

322
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,400
Riding a water scooter is more fun.

323
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,640
It's interesting and exciting.

324
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,279
I invited her first.
Can you show some respect?

325
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,119
No.

326
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,319
Can't we just do one thing at a time?

327
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,950
(Professor Chen)

328
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,680
Your teacher's call is more important.

329
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,200
Why don't you answer it first?

330
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,175
Linlin, you never played it before?

331
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,079
Professor Chen.

332
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,480
- (Hello, Yuke.)
- It's super fun.

333
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,000
- Drift on water.
- (I've read the declaration)

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,119
you sent me earlier.

335
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,775
I've emailed you some suggestions.

336
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
Hurry up and revise it.

337
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,960
Send it to me as soon as possible.

338
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,375
Can I revise it tonight?

339
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,240
I'm afraid

340
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,200
it will be a little late.

341
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,599
Okay, I see.

342
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,225
Linlin.

343
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,480
Sorry.

344
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Professor Chen has some work
for me to do.

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,960
I have to go back.

346
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,759
It's okay. Go ahead.

347
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,039
I'll stay here with Linlin.

348
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,720
It'll take an hour at the longest.

349
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,759
I promise I'll come back to you.

350
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,375
Linlin, please.

351
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,839
Botanist.

352
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,440
Welcome to my world.

353
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:11,759
I thought

354
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,599
you're going to live in the tent
with your roommates.

355
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,400
I never lived in a tent before.

356
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,000
I think I might not get used to it.

357
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,920
It's more comfortable here.

358
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
It is more comfortable here
than in a tent.

359
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,425
We're on vacation.

360
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,825
We should have fun.

361
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,799
All right,
since you got everything planned out,

362
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,839
I'll just head back.

363
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,480
Have a good time with your roommates.

364
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:40,720
Don't go.

365
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,400
Aren't you going to the base tomorrow?

366
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,079
I can go with you tomorrow.

367
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,920
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

368
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,759
I'll just go back tonight.

369
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,400
It's pretty close to the base.

370
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,680
Wouldn't it be more convenient
for you to leave from here?

371
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,775
My home is nearby.

372
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,440
Okay.

373
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:04,875
I can book a car right now.

374
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,400
I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
Aren't you here to spend the vacation
with your roommates?

376
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,150
Why do you want
to go to the base with me suddenly?

377
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,839
This place is just a staging post.

378
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,000
My goal is clear.

379
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,960
I want to stay with you.

380
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,359
I want you to be my boyfriend.

381
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,600
Ruting.

382
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,800
Have you ever heard such a story?

383
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
Once upon a time, there was a big tree

384
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,200
living happily on the bank of the river.

385
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,839
One day,

386
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
it was attracted
to the view across the river.

387
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
So it decided

388
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,680
to live across the river.

389
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
It endured the pain

390
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,359
of uprooting itself

391
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,880
and finally reached
the other side of the river,

392
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,000
only to find out

393
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,375
everything here

394
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,279
was not as perfect as it imagined.

395
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,725
The tree regretted it a lot,

396
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,400
but it didn't have the strength

397
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,960
to go back to where it came from.

398
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,960
Ruting.

399
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,319
Every plant should grow

400
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,440
in the suitable growing environment
and climate.

401
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,800
I don't want it to be hard for you.

402
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,700
What do you mean by saying that?

403
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,600
I'm sorry, Ruting.

404
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,480
I should go back.

405
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,150
Come on!

406
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,319
Come on!

407
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,600
I'll go down first,
and I'll help you down.

408
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,359
Come on, Linlin.

409
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,640
Slowly.

410
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:17,400
Linlin.

411
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,250
Come on, Linlin. Slowly.

412
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,200
Are you finished?

413
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Let's go.

414
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:23,920
Okay.

415
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,599
- Linlin!
- Linlin!

416
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,759
Where have you been?

417
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:28,880
I haven't seen you guys for a while.

418
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,559
We went for a motorboat ride.

419
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,240
Now we're going to the beach over there.

420
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,200
Do you want to join us?

421
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,240
The beach is far away.

422
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,039
Are you sure you can walk that far?

423
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,599
I don't want to go.

424
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,119
Okay. Linlin, just the two of us then.

425
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,400
Well, maybe we could rent a yacht.

426
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,720
- Let's have fun on the sea.
- Yeah.

427
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,000
We can dive and snorkel. Right?

428
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,480
We can also take pictures.
Kill multiple birds with one stone.

429
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,240
Perfect.

430
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,920
It's beautiful.
We can even see the sunset there.

431
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,519
Right?

432
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,400
Let's do it together.

433
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,839
Yeah, and I did the math.

434
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,200
With Ding, Big Mouth,
Lin Ze and Chen Chen

435
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,039
sharing the bill,

436
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,039
the price is affordable.

437
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,475
I think it's great, too.

438
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,920
When you come to the beach,
you should play in the sea.

439
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,480
What's the fun of going for a walk
on the beach?

440
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,175
Come on, Fang Yuke. Join us.

441
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,150
Okay.

442
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,039
Goodbye! Blue Rose Man!

443
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,559
The new life is coming!

444
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:22,960
- Let's get in the water!
- Let's go.

445
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,519
Let's go.

446
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,325
Come on. Let's get in the water.

447
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:28,950
Wait for me!

448
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Do you want to get in the water
and play for a while?

449
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,319
You can use a lifebuoy.

450
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,720
I'll wait for you here.

451
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,225
Linlin, I will wait for you
in the water.

452
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,680
- Okay.
- Some of these are great.

453
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,650
Come on!

454
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,119
I'm going.

455
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:57,850
Stay safe.

456
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,250
Linlin!

457
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll jump!

458
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,750
Why do I feel
you're all splashing water at me?

459
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,325
Stop splashing water at me!

460
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,759
Stop splashing!

461
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,720
It's salty!

462
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,160
Stop splashing water at me!

463
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,839
- Splash water at me!
- Splash water at me!

464
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,075
Stop splashing!

465
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,559
Stop splashing!

466
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,400
It's salty!

467
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,839
Stop splashing water at me!

468
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,150
Where is Linlin?

469
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:10,900
Where is Linlin?

470
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,279
Didn't Linlin go up there?

471
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,319
She's been down for so long.

472
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,200
Is she going to be okay?

473
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,400
God forbid. Don't be a jinx.

474
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,300
Look for her now.

475
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,982
Boss!

476
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,200
Boss!

477
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,839
Hello!

478
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,720
Linlin.

479
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,900
You really scared us!
What were you doing?

480
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,799
I went scuba diving.

481
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,880
It's so much fun.

482
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,799
Where is Fang Yuke?

483
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,000
He thought you couldn't come up.

484
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,359
He just dived off to look for you.

485
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,880
Look for me?

486
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,625
He can't swim.

487
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,425
- Ah?
- Ah?

488
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,325
Wait here. I'll find him.

489
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:05,600
Boss!

490
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,575
Find him!

491
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,825
Fang Yuke!

492
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,850
Fang Yuke!

493
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,175
Fang Yuke! Wake up!

494
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,119
You're awake.

495
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,440
Are you really fine?

496
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,319
I'm fine.

497
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,880
You've asked me a million times.

498
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,720
I'll be all right
after I get some sleep.

499
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,400
Well, I'll go back then.

500
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,559

that was the worst birthday
I had ever had.

of every girl I like?

815

Are you all ready?

817

I'll count down from three,
and we can release the lanterns together!

Why didn't you write down any wishes?

Instead of trusting God
to grant your wishes,

827
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,159
you might as well make your own plans
