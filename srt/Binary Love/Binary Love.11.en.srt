00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,319
Take your bag.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
Have you considered her feelings?

40
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,280
You want everyone to witness
your affection for her.

00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,319
I didn't consider your feelings.

I know what you're gonna say.

62

It's just I can't accept you.

If you think

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,560
we shouldn't see each other anymore,

65
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,360

Are we still friends?

but they still follow me.

The next time you run into critters,

92
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,439
try not to talk to them.

93
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,720

No, the geese are funny.

I borrowed for you comfortable?

What could be the reason?

110
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,079
Could it be that Zhou Linlin
is not the right one for Tao?

111

112
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,680

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,319
I mean, you've been trying for so long,

119
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,079
why would she want
to be friends with you?

120
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,100
What did it mean?

121
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,679
What do you mean what it meant?

122
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,720
Just the literal meaning.

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
Aren't you in a hurry?

124
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,919
Why should I be in a hurry?

125
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,840
It's good to be friends.

126
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,200
At least Linlin won't hate me

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,080
because I confessed my feelings to here.

128

As long as I'm around her,

129
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,360
I'll still have a chance.

00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,639
We need a spare key.

173
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,919
Do you have the number
of the building manager?

174
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,500
Yes.

175
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,225
I didn't bring my phone.

176
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,720
I'll have to call the agent.

177
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,799
(Hello.)

178
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,840
Hello.

179
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,240
Sorry to bother you.

180
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,799
I'm living in 301, Building 19,
Xinyuan Residence.

181
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
We can't unlock the door suddenly.

182
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,039
Could you please contact the landlord

183
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,000
to open the door?

184
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,240
(It's late now.)

185
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,919
(I don't know
if I can reach the landlord.)

186
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,575
(I'll tell you later.)

187
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,039
Oh, okay.

188
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,320
Please hurry. Thank you.

189
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,799
Don't try it. It won't open.

190
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,080
He said it's too late now.

191
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,000
He can't get here
until he reaches the landlord.

192
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah.

193
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,519
Do you have a candle?

194
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,025
There's one at the workbench.

195
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,720
It's on the shelf.

196
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,450
The second layer. See if it's there.

197
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,240
I think there is one.

198
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,840
This layer?

199
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,600
No, behind the black one.

200
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:01,960
Is it there?

201
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,625
I...

202
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
It wasn't on purpose.

203
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,080
Thank you.

204
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,240
No, it's okay.

205
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,799
What's this?

206
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,440
My final project. It's semi-finished.

207
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,000
Can you tell what it is?

208
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,850
Sorry.

209
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,519
I can't tell.

210
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,759
Where are you
with your final project?

211
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,559
I'm stuck in the drawing stage.

212
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,400
You know my drawing skills.

213
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,400
Do you have any drawing skills?

214
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
Do you need your older sister
to give you some extra lessons?

215
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,799
Why are you the older sister?

216
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,950
Are you the older sister?

217
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm two months older than you.

218
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,480
Of course, I'm the older sister.

219
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,759
Well, bite me.

220
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,799
I'm done.

221
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,300
Let me take a look.

222
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,559
What is it? Big Mouth?

223
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,920
It's you.

224
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,599
I don't accept it!

225
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,880
It's Big Mouth!

226
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,039
It's your self-portrait!

227
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,750
It looks just like you!

228
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,279
Give it to me!

229
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:00,680
Give the notebook back to me!

230
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,240
Give...

231
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,160
Give it to me.

232
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,039
No. I won't.

233
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,960
Can you just give it to me?

234
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:29,775
Coming.

235
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,680
We can't open the door.

236
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,279
Can you open it?

237
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,375
Are you finished?

238
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,880
Okay.

239
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:54,680
Thank...

240
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,039
Linlin?

241
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,319
Why are you in my house?

242
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,300
Why are you also here?

243
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,000
You... You...

244
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:07,960
You two...

245
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,599
Last night...

246
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,960
Why are you here?

247
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,039
My mom asked me to open the door.

248
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,350
Did you two spend the night here?

249
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
The circuit breaker tripped yesterday.

250
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:18,839
He came to help,

251
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,839
and then we got locked in here.

252
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,440
Thank you
for taking care of Linlin for me.

253
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,960
Who are you to thank me?

254
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,119
The door is fixed.

255
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,599
The switch on the meter box
is also fixed.

256
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,640
Better not to use high-power
electrical appliances next time.

257
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,925
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

258
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,759
No problem.

259
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,039
Linlin.

260
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,640
Let me take you to eat something
and cam your nerves.

261
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,400
Okay, I'm also hungry.

262
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,039
Linlin, why did you move out?

263
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,480
The studio in school is broken.

264
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,480
I need to catch up on my homework.

265
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,960
But it's kind of a coincidence

266
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,880
that you're the landlord.

267
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,759
Yeah.

268
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,920
The agent told me

269
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,119
the tenant is a boy.

270
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,160
It turned out to be you
when I got there.

271
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,279
Maybe the agent made a mistake.

272
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,240
Let's not talk about this.

273
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,975
Linlin.

274
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,839
Do you still need anything in the house?

275
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,759
I got everything I need.

276
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,039
I'm very pleased with your house,

277
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,250
especially the workbench.

278
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,839
The workbench?

279
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,625
Yeah.

280
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,480
We're considerate of our tenants.

281
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,175
You don't have to pay your rent anymore.

282
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,799
No way.

283
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,480
We said it's 800, and I'll pay 800.

284
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,839
800?

285
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:34,875
Yeah.

286
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,759
I mean, you don't even have to pay 800.

287
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,825
I still have to pay my rent.

288
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,440
You can help me with my English.

289
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,480
That will be your rent.

290
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,200
I can help you anytime,

291
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,960
but I'll still pay the rent.

292
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,640
Don't you speak English when you
go abroad to compete in contests?

293
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,920
It's not a speech contest.

294
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,640
Hello, here are the stir-fried
vegetables, the seafood noodles,

295
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,599
and the stew you ordered.

296
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,920
You did order the dishes
for the occasion.

297
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:09,200
Come on, Linlin, have more.

298
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:13,839
What are you doing?

299
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,720
There are carrots.

300
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,799
Carrots are rich in nutrients...

301
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,519
Stop it.

302
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:18,960
Fang Yuke, are you done?

303
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,075
I didn't mean to.

304
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,880
As a student
majoring in Computer Science,

305
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,680
don't make any mistakes
when you type the code.

306
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:28,839
Why don't you
become a stand-up comedian

307
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,839
since you have such a smooth tongue?

308
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,680
You two keep eating.
I'll go to the bathroom.

309
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,650
Did you rent the house?

310
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,640
So touching.

311
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,079
Too bad you can't let Linlin know.

312
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,119
She doesn't need to know.

313
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,480
I'm very moved.

314
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,200
Although I'm moved,

315
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,125
you still have to pay the rent.

316
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
Don't you like being a nice guy?

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,439
The rent goes up 800 next month.

318
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:03,599
For the sake of Linlin,

319
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,359
I will pay you.

320
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,799
All right.

321
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,559
What are you guys doing?

322
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,720
Why aren't you eating?

323
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,400
I asked Fang to feel free to eat.

324
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,640
It's my treat today.

325
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,640
Linlin, when are you free?

326
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,700
I want you to teach me English.

327
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,200
I've been doing my homework here lately.

328
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,200
You can come this afternoon.

329
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,240
2 PM?

330
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,759
Okay.

331
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,680
Take a picture of me.

332
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
You can have the picture.

333
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,680
Remember to see me every day.

334
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,640
You follow me around every day.

335
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,920
Don't you need to go to classes?

336
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,960
I've done all my practical assignments.

337
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,519
As for the rest,
I'm going to do it online.

338
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,279
You can't spray this here.

339
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,079
Spray sunscreen contains
pressurized gas and alcohol

340
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,599
which will burn the young leaves.

341
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,920
I'm afraid to be in the sun, too.

342
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,880
What should I do?

343
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,625
Physical sunscreen.

344
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:31,079
Well, not bad.

345
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,079
What do you want to do?

346
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,799
I'm here to learn English from Linlin.

347
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,319
You always did well
in English competitions

348
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,480
in high school.

349
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:25,200
How do you know that?

350
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,100
It's your report card.

351
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm studious,

352
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:36,839
and Linlin is willing to teach me.

353
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,000
Just mind your own business.

354
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,079
Coming.

355
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,025
Miss Zhou.

356
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,279
I'm here to learn English.

357
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,319
What are you doing here?

358
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,480
To be our teacher?

359
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:55,920
Okay.

360
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:56,960
Didn't you just teach me

361
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,160
how to draw last night?

362
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,240
Well, since he's also here,

363
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,119
just let him teach you.

364
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,519
He taught me all my English before.

365
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,920
Mr. Fang is studying for two degrees.

366
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,759
I think he is too busy to have any time.

367
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,519
Even if I give him homework,
he won't do it.

368
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,119
Do you have time?

369
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:15,720
Yes.

370
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:17,960
Will you do your homework?

371
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,599
I will.

372
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,480
Well, then suit yourselves.

373

10,000?

378
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,279
You come prepared.

379
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:52,880
Are you trying to mess with me?

380
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,799
Just tell Linlin
if you don't want to do it.

381
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,880
That will save me the time to tell her.

382
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,759
These 10,000 questions

383
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,079
cover all of the knowledge
required by the exam.

384
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
As long as you finish

It's not like your style.

I teach students
according to their aptitude.

389
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,839
Fang Yuke is very experienced
in examinations.

390
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,279
You must do as he says.

391
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:20,519
Yeah.

392
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,839
Linlin, you're always right.

393
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,920
Okay, Mr. Fang.

394
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,160
I'll do it.

395
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,880
I'll do it right here.

396
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,160
Aren't you supposed
to go to classes right now?

397
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,319
I don't have any classes.

398
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,279

to answer your questions.

Okay.

401
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,880
Linlin, do you have a pen?

402
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,759
Fang Yuke has it at his place.

403
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,680
Why don't you both go over there?

Stop doing exercise.

00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,359
Here's a gift for you.

407
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,050
Tao, are you going
to transfer to English Department?

408
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,480
Aren't you worried
you're going to fail English?

409
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,319
Here are some exercises
for you to practice on.

410
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,960
I can do some exercises.

411
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,975
But that's a lot.

412
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,599
What do you know?

413
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,850
What is this called?

414
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,000
This is called
the Sea of Questions Tactic.

415
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,119
I think you're trying to drown me.

416
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,359
Do it if you don't
want to fail the test.

417
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,039
By the way,

418

Wang Jie said the School of Design
will have a swimming test tomorrow.

419
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,225
Zhou Linlin will be there, too.

420
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,519
Should we go there and take a look?

421
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,750
Of course.

422
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,720
Why not?

423
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,279
Wasn't our school

424
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,039
recruiting lifeguards a few days ago?

425
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,079
I see.

426
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,880
I know some people at the natatorium.

427
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,975
I'll ask someone about it.

428
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,175
Zhu Li.

429
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,839
Aren't you cold wearing like this?

430
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,000
What you do know?

431
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,839
I'm gorgeous now.

432
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,119
Are we meeting over there?

433
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,750
Yeah.

434
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,160
It's the test for girls.
What are you doing here?

435
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,640
I...

436
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,880
I'm here to warm up in advance.

437
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,920
Right.

438
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,519
You can barely pass the test
at your level.

439
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,825
You should prepare in advance.

440
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,750
That student, which class are you in?

441
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,950
It's a test for girls!
Boys are not allowed to be here!

442
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,200
Wen Tao?

443
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,119
Good afternoon, Linlin.

444
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,799
Good luck to you.

445
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,720
That student, stand back!

446
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Keep going.

447
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,279
Go on.

448
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,200
Right, stand right there.

449
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,600
- Is the teacher changed?
- Come on. Fall in.

450
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,039
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

451
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,039
Hurry.

452
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Okay. Hello, everyone.

453
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,240
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

454
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,880
Let me briefly introduce yourself.

455
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,279
I'm a basketball teacher
in the Athletic Department.

456
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,440
My last name is Zhang.

457
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,200
One of your swimming teachers

458
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,200
is pregnant,

459
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,640
and the other has been recruited
by the national team.

460
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,425
So the school decided

461
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,559
to appoint me to supervise the test.

462
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,759
I hope all of you can

463
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,160
achieve good results in this test.

464
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,440
There are 32 students
in the Department of Industrial Design.

465
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,799
Has the monitor called the roll?

466
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,880
Sir.

467
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,240
Ye Ruting of our class

468
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,900
has applied for a deferred test.

469
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,240
Okay.

470
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,950
Xie Duanxi is pretty good.

471
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,079
He's so charming.

472
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,400
When will she be back?

473
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,680
She said herself

474
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,960
that she has made up her mind

475
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,839
and finished the final design
in advance.

476
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,240
She's not coming back

477
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,200
before she gets him.

478
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,960
All right, everyone.

479
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,000
Let's warm up first.

480
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,039
Arms spread out in a line.

481
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,279
Roll your wrists and ankles.

482
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,039
Come on.

483
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,359
Look at Ruting.

484
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,319
Look at you.

485
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,519
They're both here now.

486
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,319
What are you thinking?

487
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,200
I've made it clear to Wen Tao.

488
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,559
We're just friends.

489
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,680
What about Fang Yuke?
Has he been promoted?

490
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,960
Don't talk about irrelevant things
during class time.

491
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:45,275
I also want to know.

492
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
The three of you back there,
do you have any questions?

493
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,225
No.

494
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,880
Behave yourselves!

495
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:58,900
Come on, open your chest!

496
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,440
That student.

497
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,839
Don't stand here
if you're not here to take classes.

498
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:26,800
Stand back.

499
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,759
Free activities now.

500
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,475
This student.

501
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,839
Only blow the whistle
when someone is in danger.

502
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,240
Why are you blowing the whistle now?

503
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,640
Sir, he can't swim.

504
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,850
I saved his life once before.

505
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,200
I just want to keep him from danger.

506
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,275
Keep him from danger.

507
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:58,920
Is he in the water now?

508
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm sorry.

509
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,640
Don't do that again.

510
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,550
Yes.

511
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,280
Lifeguard.

512
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,800
What will you do if I'm in danger?

513
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,840
You are not in my charge.

514
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,275
I'm only responsible to save her.

515
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,125
Well, who should we look for then?

516
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Those two on the other side.
Do you see them?

517
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,320
- Come on!
- Come on!

518
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,100
Come on, Zhou Linlin!

519
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,880
- Come on!
- Come on! Zhao!

520
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,280
Come on, Zhou Linlin!

521
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,725

522
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:54,025
Come on! Come on!

523
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,300
Come on!

524
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,000
Come on!

525
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
Zhou Linlin! Faster!

526
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,175
You're catching up!

527
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,079

528
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,280
Faster! Faster!

529
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,000

Come on!

531
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,650
Come on!

532
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,239
Hey, don't move.

533
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,519
- Come on, Linlin!
- Faster!

534
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,760
Stand back. Stand back.

535
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,325
Linlin, come on!

536
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,760
What are you doing?

537
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:40,925
What...?

538
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,360
- Here!
- Hurry!

539
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:31,599
Come on, give me a hand!

540
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,400
One, two, three.

541
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,159
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

542
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,480
- Move! Move!
- Move! Move!

543
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,239
Move! Move!

544
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,480
Move!

545
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,960
- Linlin!
- Linlin! Linlin!

546
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:41,719
Move!

547
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,639
Move! Move!

548
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:44,239
Come on.

549
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
Linlin, are you all right?

550
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:47,559
Doctor.

551
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,400
Where does it hurt?

552
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,475
Well, let me take a look.

553
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,360
Does it hurt?

554
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,079
Yes.

555
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,225
What's wrong with her, Doctor?

556
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,175
She has tenderness
on the lower right side of her abdomen.

557
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,679
I think it might be acute appendicitis.

558
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,639
We need to send her to the hospital now.

559
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,650
Call the ambulance.

560
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,800
- Call the ambulance.
- Call the ambulance!

561
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,119
- Okay. Get here as soon as you can.
- Call the ambulance!

562
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
I already made the call.

563
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
It'll take it 30 minutes to get here

564
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,719
because it's the rush hour.

565
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,375
30 minutes is too long!

566
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,239
Come on, let's go!

567
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:18,719
Be careful. Be careful.

568
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,000
One, two, let's go!

569
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,079
Hold on. Change her clothes first.

570
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:21,760
Or she will catch a cold.

571
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Right. Go now.

572
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,039
Hurry. Go.

573
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,280
Hurry.

574
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,079
You go first.

575
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,159
It's the rush hour now.

576
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,320
I'll get my motorbike just in case.

577
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,000
Don't worry. Go back to class.

578
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,119
I'll take care of Linlin.

579
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:39,775
- Okay.
- Okay.

580
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:49,850
Sir.

581
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,075
Can you take a detour?

582
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,100
There is a traffic jam everywhere
at this hour.

583
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,100
I got it. I'll talk to them.

584
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,840
Excuse me, sir.

585
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,159
My friend is sick.
She is in a hurry to go to the hospital.

586
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,760
Could you move your car, please?

587
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,760
Thank you. Thank you.

588
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,159

Sir, when will we get there?

604
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
It's not far away.

605
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,320
Only two blocks away.

606
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,480
Sir, you can drop us here.

607
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,400
