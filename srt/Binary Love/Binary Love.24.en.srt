Hello. I'm your wedding planner.

My name is Chen Fei.

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,639

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,520
why not try on the dresses immediately?

47
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,800
Now?

48
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,240
Now.

49
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,975
You're beautiful now.

50
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,919
New designs of Paris Haute Couture Week.

51

Each dress

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
was handpicked by your fiancé.

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,879
Try them on.

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,841
I believe you'll love them.

So confident?

57
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,025
Sure.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,080
I'll try them on.

59
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:11,879
Then let's do it.

60
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,399
What are you in a trance?

61
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,100
How do I look?

62
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,519
I'm thinking of the first time
I met you.

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,519
Among the crowd coming and going,

64
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,639
you were standing alone by the roadside.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,639
But you were shining like a star

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,360
and no one could dim your brilliance.

67
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,600
I've made my choice.

68
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,375
I'll take this one.

69
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,950
Won't you try on other dresses?

70
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,680
He'll try on others suits.

71
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,959
All the suits.

72
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,000
This is a punishment.

73
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,350
Don't come out until you try them all.

74
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,625
Aye, my dear wife.

75
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,100
Mm.

76
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,480
You look gorgeous.

77
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm too excited to say anything.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
You indeed need to calm down.

79
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,639
Lately, you've been too busy
to have enough sleep.

80
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,120
So, Xie Duanxi and I prepared this.

81
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:12,876
But when I saw you getting jealous

82
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,480
and feeling angry because of me,

83
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,226
I found you very lovely.

84
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,839
So, I didn't tell you until today.

85
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,680
Anyway,

86
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,079
I kept it a secret from you for so long.

87
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,050
Now, I'd like to say,

88
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,025
Zhou Linlin,

89
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,639
Isn't this sorry

91
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,759
spoiling the mood?

92
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,160
If you keep kissing me,

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,600
I can't help doing
something unspeakable.

94
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,399
I wish our wedding
would be held tomorrow.

95
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm done.

96
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:36,200
How do I look?

97
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,200
Show your collarbone
to no one but me alone.

98
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Go try on another one.

99
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,240
How many dresses do I have to try on?

100
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,519
You'll have to try on

101
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,039
all the dresses hanging there.

102
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,279
Dressing for the bride-fetching,
toasting to guests, holding the ceremony,

that you'll belong to me.

Without my permission,

113

you mustn't get close to any other girl.

114
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,279
I won't.

115
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:16,735
You can show your collarbone
to no one but me alone.

116
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,889
You must be bundled up even in summer

117
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,520
so that other girls won't be attracted.

118

include her medical expenses?

170
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,360
It's okay.

171
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,960
If you don't like any of them,

172
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,320
we can hold our wedding here.

173
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
Shall we hold it in our hometown?

174
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,120
What do you say?

175
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,625
Okay.

176
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,100
Shall we hold the wedding earlier?

177
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,799
What about in ten days?

178
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,525
So soon?

179
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
Do you know how many years

180
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,440
I've been waiting for this day?

181
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,890
(Wedding)

182
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,075
Come on.

183
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,600
You're back?

184
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,200
Mom.

185
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,000
Mrs. Fang.

186
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:01,125
Mm?

187
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,360
Mom.

188
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,218
Okay.

189
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,250
Ah?

190
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,799
Why are you surprised?

191
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,850
He should call me Mom.

192
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,679
There you are.

193
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,679
Come and have dinner.

194
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,279
Dad.

195
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:13,250
Ah?

196
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,039
What?

197
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,050
Shouldn't he call you Dad?

198
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,750
He should.

199
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,720
That's right.

200
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Come and have dinner.

201
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,559
Go cook the dishes.

202
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,450
We're hungry.

203
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
I'll go take the dishes out.

204
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,399
My son-in-law,

205
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,175
on the eve of the wedding,

206
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,650
you two can't see each other.

207
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,799
But I...

208
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,750
See you at the wedding.

209
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,120
But I drove for quite a few hours.

210
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,825
Bye-bye.

211
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:35,600
No, no, no.

212
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,519
All right. All right.

213
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,720
Go to bed early.

214
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,350
I...

215
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,325
Where's he?

216
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,825
He's gone back to his home.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,450
The couple can't see each other
on the eve of the wedding.

218
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,519
There's a reason for that.

219
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,039
What reason?

220
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,879
You're immersed in good luck.

221
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,799
If you meet him, good luck will be gone.

222
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,559
You two mustn't meet.

223
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,440
Come on.

224
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,480
You ground a young girl

225
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,759
before her wedding. Isn't it ridiculous?

226
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,600
You'll be living with him
for the rest of your life.

227
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
You may even get fed up.

228
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,720
Just this one night.

229
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,240
And your father said

230
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,159
he would make a special dinner

231
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,480
for his darling daughter.

232
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,840
Enjoy it.

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,039
What are you doing?

234
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,120
- Come on.
- Let's have dinner.

235
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,679
Come and enjoy it.

236
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,879
Let's have dinner.

237
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,639
You made all the dishes, Dad?

238
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,200
Yeah. Your favorite.

239
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,519
Let me have a taste.

240
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,200
To put on the wedding dress,

241
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
I've missed a lot of delicious food.

242
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,840
Dad.

243
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,950
Linlin,

244
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
do take good care of yourself.

245
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,000
Zhou Daming, why are you crying again?

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,480
You cry a thousand times a day.

247
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,720
What are you? A crying baby?

248
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,639
Your daughter will just live
across the street.

249
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,759
Why are you so sad?

250
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,679
Dad, I will be happy.

251
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,799
Don't worry.

252
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,775
Mm.

253
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,200
Come on. Enjoy the meal.

254
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,325
Eat this, Dad.

255
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,080
Stop crying.

256
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,799
Come on.

257
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,675
Eat the meat.

258
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,759
Linlin,

259
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,879
don't be influenced by him.

260
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,679
You mustn't cry.

261
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,960
Or you can hardly use
the false eyelashes

262
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
and you won't look beautiful.

263
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,039
It's all your fault.

264
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,825
Taste great. Have some.

265
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,639
Boss, look.

266
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,039
(Wedding)
Doesn't it look better when it vibrates?

267
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,650
A little bit up. Up.

268
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:58,519
It's good.

269
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,480
It looks great already.

270
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,875
When you enjoy the wedding night,

271
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,120
we'll come and shake it for you.

272
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,600
It looks great when it vibrates.

273
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,000
Fang Yuke,

274
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,240
your nephew went to the hospital
because of diarrhea.

275
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,000
He can't sleep in your bed tonight.

276
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,200
Sleep in my bed?

277
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,880
It... It doesn't matter.

278
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,875
Mrs. Fang, we can do that.

279
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,880
Don't.

280
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,519
On the eve of the wedding,

281
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,279
after the bed is made,

282
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,160
you can't

283
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,200
sleep in it alone
or leave it unoccupied.

284
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,400
Otherwise, you and your wife will not
be together forever.

285
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,880
You know?

286
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
That's easy.

287
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
I'll sleep in it
with Big Mouth and Ding.

288
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
- We can sleep together.
- No, no.

289
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,079
It's better

290
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,160
to be a man born in the year
of Dragon or Rabbit.

291
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,880
He should be single,

292
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,200
be unmarried,
and have no love experience.

293
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,000
You get my point, right?

294
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,680
Mrs. Fang,

295
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,920
it's okay. I'm single.

296
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,079
I've never had a girlfriend.

297
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,720
Right.

298
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,225
Fang Yuke,

299
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,279
any healthier or livelier guy?

300
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,960
Most importantly, a more handsome guy.

301
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,400
- Who's that?
- Who's knocking?

302
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Who?

303
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,960
It must be your aunt.

304
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,440
Wait a second.

305
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,480
- Who are you?
- Hello, Mrs. Fang.

306
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,450
Hello.

307
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,575
Congratulations on your marriage!

308
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,759
Thanks for coming.

309
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,160
At Linlin's wedding,

310
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,759
even if I can't be the groom,

311
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,575
I have to be the most dazzling guest.

312
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,450
Fang Yuke, is he your schoolmate?

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,900
What year of animal were you born?

314
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:33,425
Ah?

315
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,275
(Wedding)

316
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,000
You turned on the light
and got up again

317
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,675
If you keep doing this, I'll leave.

318
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,525
I'm nervous.

319
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,799
About what?

320
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,775
There'll be a lot of guests tomorrow.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,450
I fear I can't say even a single word

322
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,650
in front of so many people.

323
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,425
Umm...

324
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,839
Umm...

325
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,799
Then, I'll help you to rehearse it.

326
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,275
You?

327
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,800
The dress fits me perfectly.

328
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,125
Hurry. Untie me.

329
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,880
Untie me.

330
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,525
Is it tight?

331
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,880
I can't even breathe.

332
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,350
This dress is

333
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:33,755
too small for me.

334
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,920
You must try on the bridesmaid dresses

335
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,720
one week before my wedding.

336
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,775
Don't provoke us.

337
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,650
One of you is getting married tomorrow.

338
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,691
And the other will get married soon.

339
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,440
Only you and I have no love.

340
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,319
I have.

341
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,039
Who told you I didn't have love?

342
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,559
I'm already in love.

343
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,279
Why are you even taking revenge?

344
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,880
I'll buy a ticket and leave now.

345
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,759
Bye-bye.

346
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
What's your relationship
with Xiao Yi now?

347
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,119
You must be hungry, huh?

348
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,050
I'll go get you something to eat.

349
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,680
Here are biscuits.

350
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,375
- Here's something to eat.
- Don't dream to escape.

351
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,825
Come on. Have some beer.

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,680
Today, we'll get to the bottom
of your relationship with Xiao Yi.

353
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,675
You won't.

354
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,775
You can't drink the beer, bride.

355
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
Or you'll be bloated tomorrow.

356
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,125
Have some carrots.

357
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,319
Tomorrow,

358
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,275
shall I hold her right hand...

359
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,925
Or her left hand...

360
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,925
- What?
- Oh.

361
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,200
What are you doing?

362
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,559
What's wrong?

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,559
Can your hands only touch
tennis rackets?

364
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,279
None of your business.

365
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,039
It's just my first time
to hold someone's hands.

366
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,480
And I don't want that person to be you.

367
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,175
What an innocent boy!

368
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:52,759
Fang Yuke,

369
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm warning you.

370
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
If you can't make Linlin happy,

371
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,325
I'll take your place any time.

372
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,325
Aren't you done with movements?

373
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,799
Recite the vow quickly.

374
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,050
Then go to bed.

375
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,525
Look.

376
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,720
Tomorrow, none of us shall
steal Linlin's thunder.

377
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,350
Of course.

378
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,675
I won't.

379
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,125
Come on. Why are you staring at me?

380
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,119
Do I look like I'll steal her thunder?

381
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,125
You do.

382
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:35,725
Mm.

383
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,100
Drink the beer.

384
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,000
- How annoying!
- Cheers.

385
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,720
- Don't make it squirt.
- You'll get married.

386
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,759
Cheers.

387
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,079
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

388
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,720
Looks so beautiful.

389
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,680
Hello, hello.

390
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,400
Welcome.

391
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,039
Congratulations. Congratulations.

392
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,575
Your friends?

393
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:56,175
Yes.

394
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,599
I'm going to the lounge.

395
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,559
I'll be back to you later.

396
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,519
Okay.

397
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,680
I can then check

398
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,800
the flower decorations here.

399
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,559
Is that the bride?

400
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,799
They look like a perfect match.

401
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,519
Yeah.

402
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,925
Is she Mrs. Zhou's daughter?

403
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,359
Why does she look so different?

404
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,039
Is it really her in the wedding photo?

405
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,500
Such a handsome young man.

406
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,800
He also looks different in the photo.

407
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,300
Yeah.

408
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,600
(Our Wedding)

409
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,200
Sir, you look beautiful.

410
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,925
Just like the Floral Fairy.

411
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,519
Little girl, the Floral Fairy is a girl.

412
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,200
So, I am the Floral Fairy.

413
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,375
Is this your wedding?

414
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,950
No.

415
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,960
If it's not your wedding,

416
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,000
why are you dressed so beautifully?

417
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,225
Stealing the bride's thunder?

418
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,519
Stealing the bride's thunder?

419
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,275
Am I?

420
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,799
No.

421
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,359
Look at their fathers...

422
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,720
Hello.

423
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,319
Mrs. Zhou, as the bride's mother,

424
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,559
you should stand over here.

425
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,359
By the way,

426
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,319
I just checked.

427
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
The guest list is a little bit different

428
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,039
from the one we agreed.

429
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,079
Let's check it out later.

430
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,680
Mrs. Fang, relatives of the groom

431
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,160
should also take their seats asap.

432
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,039
Arrange the seats for them

433
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,279
and don't delay the ceremony.

434
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,559
Who are you?

435
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,279
Me?

436
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:40,525
It's me.

437
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm Wang Jie.

438
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,880
The couple has entrusted me

439
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,200
with the wedding.

440
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,640
I want to give Linlin a perfect wedding.

441
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,650
I don't want anything to go wrong.

442
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,359
All right.

443
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,279
Do what you have to do.

444
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,119
I'll get in first.

445
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,000
Bye-bye.

446
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,559
Wang Jie?

447
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,319
Who's that girl?

448
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,100
Linlin's classmate.

449
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,075
Zhu Li,

450
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,100
give me a cupcake.

451
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,575
No way. You can't eat anything.

452
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,925
Then I'll faint during the wedding.

453
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:29,960
Don't worry.

454
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,079
I've got this for you.

455
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,839
What's this?

456
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,119
With this,

457
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,000
when you feel dizzy,

458
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
apply some on your forehead

459
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,125
and you'll get sober

460
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:42,234
Here. Take it.

461
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,825
Are you out of mind?

462
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:47,715
Linlin.

463
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,480
Look at you.

464
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,839
You're getting married to Fang Yuke.

465
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,119
Just hang in there.

466
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,440
It's okay. I'll give you power.

467
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,400
Come on. Let's hug.

468
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,100
I don't want to hug you.

469
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,079
Stay away.

470
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,160
Don't stain Linlin's wedding gown.

471
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,079
Get up.

472
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,575
Wang Jie!

473
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,640
You...

474
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,875
Look at your diamond ring.

475
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,350
And look at your bag.

476
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,079
Oh, I see.

477
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:19,720
You...

478
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,750
You came to steal Linlin's thunder,
right?

479
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,680
What's wrong with your neckline?

480
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,925
Did you put it on backwards?

481
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,440
Sorry.

482
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,480
The neckline of the dress

483
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,319
can be too tight.

484
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,000
I just altered it a little bit.

485
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,119
After all, I have a sexy body.

486
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,850
I can't hide it under the dress.

487
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,359
It is?

488
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,960
What are you doing?

489
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,039
Why are you pinning my neckline?

490
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,160
You may prick me.

491
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,680
Shut up.

492
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,519
Oh my goodness.

493
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,880
At Zhou Linlin's wedding,

494
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,599
no one shall steal her thunder.

495
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,519
I must guarantee the wedding to...

496
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,000
Linlin, look at her.

497
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,640
- What are you doing?
- Put it down!

498
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,475
Put it down!

499
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,079
Cool. Smart.

500
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:02,720
Good.

501
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Have you checked the wedding site?

502
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,000
Big Mouth.

503
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,599
For every item,

504
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,640
we've checked carefully and closely

505
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,025
and didn't miss anything.

506
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,550

I have no other request.

Only you and me.

656

657

658

662

So they're too embarrassed
to come, right?

663
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,000
It must be the reason.

664

You know what?

665
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,480
Boss doesn't need to compete with them.

666
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,079
They're so weak

667
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,760
that even I can overwhelm them.

668
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,480
I'm going to the bathroom.

669
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,719
A piece of cake.

670
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,719
The three are quite funny.

671
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,119
I'll give them the brush-off.

672
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,679
I'm having a stomach upset.

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,599
I'm going to the bathroom.

675
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,280
Go ahead, then.

676
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:34,300
- Ouch.
- Off you go.

677
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,000
What?

678
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,975
No... Nothing.

679
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,250
Whose ring is this?

680
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,719
I want

681
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,850
to give you

682
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,400
this ring

683
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,575
with my love for you.

684
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,639
Zhu Li,

685
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,480
I've always wanted
to tell you something.

686
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,199
But I was too shy to say it.

687
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,159
Now, the atmosphere is just right.

688
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,239
I have to tell you.

689
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,320
Actually, I...

690
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,000
Do you feel any better?

691
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:51,825
I'm even hungrier.

692
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,000
Hurry.

693
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,079
Come and make the toasts.

694
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,875
Or the banquet would be over.

695
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,750
You ate the lemon candy

696
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,800
and you got changed.

697
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,700
Is it time to call me Honey?

698
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,880
I'm too hungry to call you that.

699
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,675
Let's go.

700
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,875
Dear distinguished guests,

701
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,400
here's the toasting part
of the bride and groom.

702
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,599
Thank you for coming all the way

703
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,119
to witness their happiness.

704
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,400
Let's have the bride and groom

705
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,525
send their best wishes to you.

706
00:39:58,875 --> 00:39:59,480
What...?

707
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,559
What's wrong with the spotlight?

708
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,550
You got the wrong guys,
light controller.

709
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,900
Distinguished guests,

710
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,599
the show we prepared for you

711
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,519
turned out to be terrific.

712
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,679
Now it's dessert time.

713
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,880
Waiter, serve the dessert, please.

714
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,840
Enjoy the dessert, please.

715
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:18,975
Applause.

716
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,639
It's my wedding.

717
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,559
Why are you both angry?

718
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,119
She ruined the wedding.

719
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,840
Everything was out of order.

720
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,639
Didn't we agree

721
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,000
not to steal Linlin's thunder?

722
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,400
Big Mouth suddenly professed his love.

723
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,039
I didn't expect that.

724
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,000
It's the only wedding in her lifetime.

725
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,360
But you stole all the thunder!

726
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,559
Look how angry Linlin is.

727
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,079
Her face is ghastly pale.

728
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,280
Didn't you steal her thunder, either?

729
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,199
Look at your diamond ring.

730
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,559
It dazzles my eyes.

731
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,280
Come on. Look.

732
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,480
Linlin can't even open her eyes.

733
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,639
I'm going to the bathroom.

734
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,639
Linlin!

735
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,320
Are you all right?

736
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,000
Are you okay?

737
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,039
I... I'm not okay.

738
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,280
Look, we make Linlin faint out of anger.

739
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,800
Sorry, Linlin.

740
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,639
Sorry.

741
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,000
Not out of anger,

742
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,239
but hunger.

743
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:23,280
It's so hard to go through a wedding.

744
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,920
Wang Jie, I know

745
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,440
you want me to have a perfect wedding.

746
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,960
Zhu Li, I'm also happy

747
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,079
that you found your true love.

748
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,725
Actually, I don't care

749
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,100
if my wedding can be perfect.

750
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,800
As long as you're all by my side,

751
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,000
I'll be happy enough.

752
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:40,880
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,000
It's remiss of me.

754
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,800
I'll take you to eat something.

755
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,825
If you go out now,
you'll get all the attention.

756
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,525
I mean...

757
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,280
They will ask you to drink with them.

758
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,625
Then you can't enjoy your meal.

759
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,225
Let's eat out, then.

760
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,150
I'll take you to eat something nice.

761
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:01,800
Wait.

762
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,840
It's time for toasts.

763
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,199
It's extremely hard for you to leave.

764
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:17,900
Linlin,

765
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,440
we don't mean to steal your thunder.

766
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,325
But now,

767
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,960

Your hair is shorter.

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,325
Your face is more angular.

809
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,400
Once you stop shaving, you have stubble.

810
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,559

Mr. Zhou!

820
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,239
Here I am.

821
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:22,519
You freaked me out.

822
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,125
You even scared the fish away.

823
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,280
- Mr. Zhou, without me,
- What?

824
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,599
do you find it boring to fish?

825
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,480
You tell me.

826
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,119
Tell me.

827
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,250
How long haven't you visited me yet?

828
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:34,559
After the game was over,

829
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,719
I got here as quickly as I could.

830
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,200
I didn't even waste a single minute.

831
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:38,800
Good boy, then.

832
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:41,475
You've got so many fish already?

833
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,639
Yes, a few.

834
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,239
Fish on the line!

835
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,119
It's biting. Come on.

836
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:56,840
Fish on the line!

837
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,960
Come on. Hurry.

838
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,599
The fish is biting.

839
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:00,159
Come on. Another one.

840
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,880
Here.

841
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:03,079
Get it.

842
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,199
What a big fish!

843
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,559
Well done, son.

844
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,850
You're better at fishing now.

845
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:10,199
Of course.

846
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:11,559
You're a good teacher, after all.

847
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,559
Aren't you sweet?

848
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,275
Well, Mr. Zhou...

849
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,000
What?

850
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:25,840
It's been a long time.

851
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:27,075
Umm...

852
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,159
Mrs. Zhou...

853
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,239
How's Mrs. Zhou?

854
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,519
My wife?

855
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:33,320
She's very well.

856
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,400
Still strong.

857
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,079
You know what?

858
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,480
She just scolded me this morning.

859
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,200
I'm glad to know she's very well.

860
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:45,239
What about Fang Yuke?

861
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,760
I haven't seen him
for a long time, either.

862
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,650
How's he doing?

863
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,400
He's doing  great.

864
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,119
He's just too busy with work.

865
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,975
Linlin is all right, too.

866
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,519
She's just got a little problem lately.

867
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,119
So, she's back here for recuperation.

868
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:05,639
Linlin has got a little problem?

869
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:06,475
What happened?

870
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,300
Mr. Zhou, what happened to her?

871
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,126
Is she sick?

872
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
No, no.

873
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,840
She isn't sick.

874
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,675
She is...

875
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,650
She's pregnant?

876
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,325
It's a good thing, Mr. Zhou.

877
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:28,840
Congratulations.

878
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,239
If you need any help,

879
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:32,250
let me know.

880
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,079
Focus on your games.

881
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,150
We're good.

882
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:38,719
Fang Yuke is

883
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:39,519
quite a good husband.

884
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
He's so busy.

885
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,360
But he still takes good care of Linlin.

886
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,960
He comes back every weekend.

887
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,960
We have nothing to worry about.

888
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:46,880
Isn't that great?

889
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,079
That's good.

890
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,239
That's good.

891
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:05,150
By the way, how are you doing lately?

892
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:06,950
Me?

893
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,079
Everything is great.

894
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,280
No one can defeat me in games.

895
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm not asking about games.

896
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,119
I'm asking about your love life.

897
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,775
Have you got a girlfriend?

898
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,025
I'm such a handsome man.

899
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:21,480
I want to pick the best girl.

900
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,679
All right, then.

901
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:27,200
When you meet your cup of tea,

902
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:28,239
take her back to us.

903
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,320
My wife and I will meet her

904
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,639
and give you some advice.

905
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:33,075
Mm.

906
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:34,664
Don't worry. I will.

907
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,250
I'll go get a bottle of water
from my car.

908
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,350
Watch it for me.

909
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:43,950
Mm.
