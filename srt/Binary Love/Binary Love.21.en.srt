Hello.

I'm Fang Yuke from Fangzhou Technology,

go to work in this shirt.

26
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,719
So, you planned this?

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
It's just for work.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,719
Then why must you be my client?

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
You take your clients very seriously.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,039
So, I want to be one.

All right, then.

What specific requirements do you have

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,350
for the package or design
of your product?

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,700
I have only one requirement

35
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,250
that you must be the designer.

36

Me?

39

Aren't you supposed to tell me
what you like?

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,599
I like everything you're fond of.

41
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,599
Because you are

42

43

Let's talk about the design, then.

Okay.

45

But before that,

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,319
let's first decide

47
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,560
what to have for lunch, Chinese food,

48
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,759
Western food, or Japanese food?

Right, we're working.

All right, Mr. Fang.

53

Mr. Fang, thank you for the lunch.

54

I owe thanks to you.

for having a meeting with me

57

Master Zhou?

59

Why do you call me that?

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,039
Isn't that what designers are called?

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,280
What else shall I call you, then?

62

Engineer Zhou?

Call me Master Zhou, then.

64
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,719
I can't do dream interpretation, anyway.

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,879

66

What is this?

69

Something to confirm the general idea

70

of the package design of our company.

may be appropriate for your company.

what elements

do you think should be added?

78
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,600
Jellyfish.

Jellyfish?

Mm.

But jellyfishes are slow.

82
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,279
Programs have to be fast

83

and then speed up the world.

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,840
Wen Tao made this decision himself.

172
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,559
It's good for your career, too.

173
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,375
You'll have a win-win prospect.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,879
Hope we'll work well together.

175
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,919
I hope so, too.

176
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,840
Mr. Xiao,

177
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,039
may I ask for a leave?

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,639
Go ahead.

179
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,759
I should go, Miss Qi.

180
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,250
Zhou Linlin?

181
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,000
Who are you calling?

182
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,000
That's indeed Zhou Linlin. Look.

183
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,440
Linlin?

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,559
Linlin, what are you doing here?

185
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,720
Ms. Zhou is indeed very promising.

186
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,320
For future work,

187
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,720
we'll highly cooperate with her.

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,399
I think highly of her, too.

189
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,360
Among our designers,

190
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,919
she's one of the best.

191
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,840
Mr. Xiao, don't bother to walk me out.

192
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,799
I should go.

193
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,440
Okay. Hope we'll cooperate pleasantly.

194
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,200
We will.

(BQ Design)

196
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,639
Sorry,

197
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,700
but Ms. Zhou isn't in the office now.

198
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,360
Zhou Linlin is wanted?

199
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:58,175
Mm.

200
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,325
Who?

201
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,399
Mr. Fang's subordinate
who came yesterday.

202
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,960
He wants to have a meeting
with Ms. Zhou in the aquarium later.

203
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,000
All right.

204
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,919
I'll tell Ms. Zhou as soon as possible.

205
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:11,399
Mm. Goodbye.

206
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,720
Don't call her. I'll tell her about it.

207
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,000
I hear you'll sign a full contract

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,639
of PR Band with BQ Design.

209
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,639
Right.

210
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,559
I planned to surprise you.

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,919
Do you know how much time

212
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,279
a full contract will take up?

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
You may not even have time

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,200
for the basic training.

215
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,320
I want you to think carefully about it.

216
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,240
Don't give up your career

217
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
for anyone.

218
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,159
I've thought carefully about it.

219
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,759
But whenever you need me,

220
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,399
I'll cooperate without reservation.

221
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,240
Didn't we agree

222
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,759
to be friends only?

223
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,840
Linlin, do I...?

224
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,200
Do I not stand even a little chance?

225
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,519
Sorry,

226
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,919
but in my heart,
there's no space for anyone else.

227
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:45,895
Since I was little,

228
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,175
he's been the most special guy
in my heart.

229
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,120
He has given me a lot of love

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,200
that makes me who I am now.

231
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,919
He fills my whole youth.

232
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,399
Mr. Xiao, what are you doing here?

233
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,320
Linlin has gone to see Wen Tao.

234
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,325
Did you arrange that?

235
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
You're my VIP client.

236
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,799
Wherever you want a meeting,

237
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,720
I'll be there.

238
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,879
The contract defines

239
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,039
that I have the right
to pick the designer.

240
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,799
I can terminate the contract
at any time.

241
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,800
Yes, you can.

242
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,450
You can also change a designer.

243
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
But Mr. Xiao,

244
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,799
you have no idea of our love.

245
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,679
I've been waiting for Linlin
for so many years.

246
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,799
Such a small problem

247
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,320
can't even be a test for me.

248
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,240
Nothing can change my love for Linlin.

249
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,600
(Marry Me)

250
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,639
She's about to knock off.

251
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,240
Don't you go and find her?

252
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,399
Don't you think

253
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,639
Fang Yuke is just like the old you?

254
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,279
You haven't done such a thing
for quite a long time.

255
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,240
She...

256
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,599
She deserves this.

257
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,825
Tao is forced to be a career-driven man.

258
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,240
You know what?

259
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,359
When he succeeds in his career,

260
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,400
he definitely fails in love.

261
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,279
Indeed.

262
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:31,400
Hi.

263
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,265
Hi.

264
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,319
Why are you back so early?

265
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,240
Early?

266
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,079
I'm already exhausted.

267
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:39,799
How do you feel?

268
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,440
You must be super happy, right?

269
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,950
Why?

270
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm just so worried about Wen Tao.

271
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
On such a big day,

272
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
why are you talking about Wen Tao?

273
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,319
I went to see him

274
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,480
in case he signed
a full contract on a whim.

275
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,640
So, you didn't go to the aquarium?

276
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,559
What aquarium?

277
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,799
But Big Mouth and Ding...

278
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,000
Forget it. Never mind.

279
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,799
It's already too late, anyway.

280
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,640
What are you talking about?

281
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,119
Nothing.

282
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,079
I'll get back to work.

283
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,240
No way. Something must have happened.

284
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,000
Let me know.

285
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,640
If I tell you,

286
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
could you still pretend you don't know?

287
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:13,925
Mm.

288
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,920
He'll propose to you.

289
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,350
Ah?

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,450
I really feel sorry for Fang Yuke.

291
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,599
He failed for the second time.

292
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,525
The second time?

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Linlin, I gotta go.

294
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:33,880
- Oh.
- I should go.

295
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,680
Bye-bye.

296
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
Zhu Li, bye-bye.

297
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,519
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

298
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,799
Bye-bye.

299
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,599
You freaked me out.

300
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,359
What are you doing?

301
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,150
Why do you wear heavy makeup
even after work?

302
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
It takes me 17 minutes and 38 seconds

303
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,599
to get back home from the office.

304
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,519
I'll pass three corners
and two crossings.

305
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,400
Such are good chances
to meet my Mr. Right.

306
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,079
What?

307
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,599
Are you here to give me any guidance?

308
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,319
No, no.

309
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm just a little bit nervous.

310
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,440
Fang Yuke failed twice.

311
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,799
He can't fail the third time, right?

312
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,119
Tell me about his plan for next time.

313
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,875
I've already told you all that I know.

314
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:28,960
Fine.

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,240
I'll ask Big Mouth and Ding.

316
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,950
What?

317
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,119
Come on, don't do this.

318
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,119
Why not leave some space
for a surprise?

319
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,559
I don't want any emergency
to disturb his plan.

320
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,000
He will drive here to pick you up,

321
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,640
right?

322
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,675
Mm.

323
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Then you'll have dinner in a canteen?

324
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,950
Mm.

325
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:50,799
According to my experience

326
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,599
and where you're going,

327
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,839
there can be only a few options.

328
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,850
First, open the trunk of his car

329
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,599
and you'll see bunches of flowers.

330
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,400
Second, take a seat in the canteen,

331
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:01,975
and you'll see fireworks.

332
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,400
When did you have such experience?

333
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,799
Show me some respect, okay?

334
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,225
What if I see neither of them?

335
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,720
Then comes the third option.

336
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,200
You will go back to your home

337
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,119

What about you? Where were you?

I talked with Mr. Xiao
about the proposals.

Why are you suddenly
so interested in him?

352

I'm your client.

to take up your private time.

We don't know the code.

Well, it's considerate of them.

462
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,480
With such a complicated passcode,

463
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,650
it's very safe.

464
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,119
It's not complicated at all.

491
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,359
They don't have common sense.
How can the candies deodorize the room?

492
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,960
Yeah. They even
put the candies on the floor.

493
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Don't sweep the candies away.
It's still good to eat.

494
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,680
Put it out, then.

496
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,920

Don't always be a mess.

505
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,079
It's the best for deodorizing.

506
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,920
Eat the fruit and use the peel.

507
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,799
Fang Yuke,

508

take good care of Linlin.

509
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,680
Don't make a mess at home.

510
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,319
You hear me?

511
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,650
All right. Let's continue.

512
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,250
Okay.

513
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,079
Let's go.

514
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,200
It's just our luck.

515
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,319
What are you doing?

516
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,825
Having a meeting.

517
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,425
For business.

518
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,759
May I have a look?

519
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:34,850
Mm.

520
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,000
Linlin.

521
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,025
(Hello, Linlin.)

Mm.

533
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:16,275
Mom,

534
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,880
why are you watching TV?

535
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,119
Linlin, look.

536
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,640
Have you watched this drama?

537
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,440
The Romance of Tiger and Rose. So cute.

538
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,279
We love to watch it, right?

539
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,680
This young man is good.

540
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,119
He is, isn't he?

541
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,759
If you say that,

542
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,920
I think

543
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,419
my son-in-law Fang Yuke is better.

544
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,440
Your son-in-law?

545
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,839
Isn't he my son-in-law?

546
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,559
Isn't he?

547
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,359
Mom, isn't it time for bed?

548
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,160
It's already late.

549
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,599
We slept on our way here.

550
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,559
We're not sleepy at all.

551

What's wrong with you?

554
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,559
Why are you laughing
when watching such a dangerous scene?

555
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,730
(Call him Hero.)

(What do you think?)

557

Look. It's so tiny.

558

Did you just realize that?

559
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,920
Look at the grape you gave me.

560
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,880
You finally noticed it.

561
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,960
Did you dry it?

562
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,279
I just didn't remind you.

when I look up at you.)

It was okay just now.

- Yeah.
- What happened?

573
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,039
Recently, Wi-Fi in our community

574
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,480
doesn't work very well.

575
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,975
What a poor community!

576
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,599
Are you sleepy, Ms. Hong Xia?

577
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,880
Go to bed, then.

578
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,920
Right. Let's get to bed.
We can watch it tomorrow.

579
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,799
Wait. Wait a moment.

580
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,720
It's still early.

Just go.

582
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,240
The bed is made. Everything's ready.

I'll complain to the property manager.

587
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,440
Poor Wi-Fi!

588

Okay, complain later.

589
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,759
Turn it off. Don't waste electricity.

590
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,000
I'll turn it off. Be careful.

Actually,

602
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,039
I prepared a lot of surprises today.

603
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,199
I knew.

604
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,840
I picked a good timing

605

and a good location.

606
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,440
But when you walked to me from there,

607
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
I realized

608
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,239
that nothing else

609
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:13,800

or love anyone.

614
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,599
I was a silly boy

615

who was stuck in his own world.

616
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,880
Your appearance changed everything.

617

I cared about no one but you.

620

Life without you

621
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,225
feels like the binary system
without the digit 1

622
