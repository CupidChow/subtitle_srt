We can order more if it's not enough.

Cheers.

70
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,199
I thought you were doing well
in your team.

71
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,100
Why would you come to our team?

72
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,639
I was about to tell you.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
I found a piece of shocking news.

74
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,959
The leader of team B

75
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,720
hooked up with his secretary.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,639
His wife went to the company
and made a scene.

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,879
I was thinking

78
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,480
the leader probably
wouldn't be around long.

79
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,439
So I saw the opportunity

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
and volunteered to join your team.

81
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,480
Wait, what's your attitude?

82
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,279
Are you not surprised?

83
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,759
What's so surprising about that?

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,399
Doesn't everyone
in the company know it?

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,950
It's nothing new.

86
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,079
I mean, if one day

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,040
Fang Yuke cheats on you...

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,759
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,680
I mean "if".

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,759
There is no "if".

91
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,120
Just eat.

92
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,560
There's a new ornament shop ahead.

93
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,959
Let's take a walk there
and it helps digest.

94
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm not going.
I have a meeting this afternoon.

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,560
I should leave.

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,079
- Okay.
- Okay.

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,519
I'm not going, either.

98
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,519
Xie Duanxi sent me a message on WeChat.

99
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,625
I'm going on a date.

100
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,300
Ah.

101
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,750

102
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,625
Yeah.

103
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,360
What are you texting?
Let me take a look.

104
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,000
I told you I wouldn't tell you.

105
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,399
Well, I have something to do.
I have to go.

106
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,600
I'll call you tonight.

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,560
Bye-bye.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,680

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
You all ditch me.

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,959
Xie Duanxi?

112
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,879
They are kissing!

113
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,525
Do you know how to drive?

114

Jie!

115
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,920
Why do you

116
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,000
get drunk so early?

117
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,079
I have something

118
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,240
extremely important to tell you.

119
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,275
Okay.

120
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,040
Drink.

121
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,439
No.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,839
My treat.

123
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,360
Hello.

124
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,199
This one.

125
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,639
Thank you.

127
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,925
When are you free these days?

128
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,079
Well, are you asking me out?

129
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:24,920
Yeah.

130
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,680
I've been really busy lately,

131
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
but considering you're so sincere,

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,360
I'll do you a favor.

133
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,720
I have a niece

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,320
who really likes Barbie dolls
in wedding dresses.

135
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,799
But I'm a man.

136
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,200
I don't know where to buy it.

137
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,440
So I'd like you to buy it with me.

138
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,275
That's easy.

139
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,240
You can pick one on the Internet
and send it to her directly.

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,240
I bought a few.

141
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,439
She doesn't like any of them.

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
So I'm thinking

143
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,399
maybe you can go to the store with me.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
Let me see when I'm free.

145
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,080
Okay.

146
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,519
Not Monday, not Tuesday.

147
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,600
Not Wednesday or Friday.

148
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,840
I have meetings.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,039
And not Thursday.

150
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,675
Yeah?

151
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,275
I have a client meeting on Thursday.

152
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,100
Tell your niece to give up on Barbies.

153
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,500
No way, Zhou Linlin.

154
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,000
You have to help me.

155
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:24,226
Why do I have to help you?

156
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:25,080
Because I...

157
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,175
I can give you a massage.

158
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:33,919
I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

159
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,725
Okay.

160
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:36,866
What are you gonna give me in return?

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,010
I see.

162
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,061
What are you doing?

163
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,399
To return your favor.

164
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,799
I'm tired from working.

165
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,175
Some fried chicken will do.

166
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:54,845
You know better than me.

167
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,600
I can return your favor in a better way
when I have strength.

168
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,440
Order a takeout.

169
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,519
What do you want to eat?

170
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,519

or not?

189

Why are you keeping your voice down?

190

That's something

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,960
you have to say.

192
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,799

She's gonna freak out if she knows it.

194

She just looks scary.

In fact,

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,279
she is soft on the inside.

No.

200

I'm not afraid of Ruting getting mad.

201
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,375
I'm worried that she will be sad.

You don't look like
you are picking a gift.

It's hard to choose gifts
for others, okay?

209
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,399
You have to know their characters

210

and what they like.

211
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,480
You might hit a minefield by accident.

Don't worry too much.

your niece is pretty cute.

That's a highly rated restaurant.

According to his billing records,

323

What kind of work was it
that he had to do it in a restaurant?

00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:25,206
Did he water the flowers with red wine?

330
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,839
I think

331
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,720
none of your evidence can directly prove

332
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
that he cheated on you.

333
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,039
Besides, he's not that kind of person.

334
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:37,039
Calm down and think about

335
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,119
what he's really like.

336
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,160
He wouldn't lie to you.

337
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,079
There's only one way

338
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,559
to make me stop doubting him.

508
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,145
What are you doing, Thinker?

509
00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:38,625
You've been hanging around here
for a while.

510
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,719
I had a few drinks by myself yesterday.

511
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,800
My head hurts a little bit.

512
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,960
I haven't decided
if I should tell Ruting about it.

513
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
I told you

514
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,639
to tell her directly.

515
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,039
You can't keep such things from Ruting.

516
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,559
How am I going to say it?

517
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,559
Are you keeping it
from Ruting on purpose

518
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,840
so that you have a reason to get drunk?

519
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,500
You...

520
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:02,945
Fine! No time like the present.
I'll tell her today.

521
00:35:03,575 --> 00:35:04,215
Let's go.

522
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:29,400
- I have something to tell you.
- I have something to tell you.

523
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,599
What is it?

524
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,400
My thing is in no hurry.

525
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,360
You go ahead first.

526
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:40,400
I noticed that Xie Duanxi
has been acting strange lately.

527
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:42,365
So Linlin and I went to investigate it.

528
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,449
Did you know it?

529
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,679
Know what?

530
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,610
Well...

531
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,980
Last time, I saw Xie Duanxi

532
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,320
with a woman with purple hair...

533
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,559
When did you see that?

534
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,119
The last time we met.

535
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,500
Why didn't you tell us?

536
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,239
Why are you reacting like this?

537
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,840
Ruting should be the one to be mad.

538
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,880
When we followed Xie Duanxi yesterday,

539
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,119
we found that woman

540
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
also has an unusual relationship
with Fang Yuke.

541
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,519
What?

542
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:32,159
Sit down.

543
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,320
What's going on with them?

544
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,880
We're going

545
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,159
to see that woman tonight

546
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,639
and get things straight.

547
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,719
Rest assured.

548
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,599
I won't be Zhu Li
if I don't knock her down on her knees

549
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,679
and make her apologize.

550
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:49,191
And also,

551
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:50,559
Fang Yuke and Xie Duanxi.

552
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,800
What kind of people are they?

553
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Scums.

554
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,880
We will go there first after work

555
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,119
and we will send you the address.

556
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,280
The WeChat code

557
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,639
is shopping.

558
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,360
Don't worry. I got it.

559
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:21,719
Well?

560
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,760
I've called a cab.

561
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,199
It will be our time

562
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,400
to show what we can do.

563
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,039
Wait.

564
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,119
What are you going to do?

565
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,880
Are you going to cook?

566
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,280
Listen,

567
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,599
this is a professional outfit.

568
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,119
If we are going to fight later,

569
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,719
fists have no eyes.

570
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,700
My hairnet

571
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,800
can keep her from pulling my hair,

572
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,760
and this jacket

573
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,280
can keep her from scratching me.

574
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,679
By the way, I prepared an outfit

575

for each of you.

576

577
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,679

You can take over the wheel and drive!
