- The shooting is about to start.
- ...and the insignificance of myself.

167
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,320
I have to talk to him in person.

168
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,875
- Tell Fang Yuke for me.
- I want to thank Southern University.

169
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,450
Here.

170
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,360
Wait, you...

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,175
It gave me dignity,
knowledge and affection.

172
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,039
- Where is she going?
- And the determination and strength...

173
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,401
- She went to a meeting.
- ...to keep running in the rain.

174
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,450
There's one more person I want to thank.

175
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,500
I want to thank her

176
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,475
for coming into my life
suddenly and passionately.

177
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,800
Thank you for your smile.

178
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,200
Thank you for your optimism.

179
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,240
Thank you for being there for me.

180
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,575
Thank you

181
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,075
for making my life more meaningful.

182
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Our story began

183
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,720
on this campus.

184
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,975
I also hope

185
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,725
we can move into a new chapter here.

186
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,600
Affection is like the floating clouds.

187
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,075
Love is like the gentle breeze.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
For the rest of our lives,

189
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,159
I have you,

190
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,725
and you have me.

191
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
It's so romantic.

192
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,425
Where is she?

193
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:57,452
(CHOCOLATE BOX Qianyang 26)

197
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:07,550
Eh?

198
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,559
Where is
the product coordination meeting?

199
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,360
The large meeting room.

200
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,960
Okay.

201
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,975
Is the graduation ceremony over so soon?

202
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,240
You're back so fast.

203
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
The shooting starts tomorrow.

204
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,100
I must be there
for the last coordination meeting.

205
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,000
I put a lot of thought into this project

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,159
from the conceptual design
to what it has become now.

207
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
I want to leave no regret

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,799
in my first work.

209
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,519
Your efforts won't be wasted.

210
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,480
Sit down.

211
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,879
Mr. Xiao, the guest has arrived.

212
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,800
I'll pick her up.

213
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,550
I'll be here with you till the end.

214
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,300
Linlin missed a big diamond.

215
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,799
Affection is like the floating clouds.
Love is like the gentle breeze.

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,399
That's so romantic.

217
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,200
How could Zhou Linlin miss it?

218
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,759
I wonder who's so immoral

219
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,960
as to call her away.

220
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,559
Such people
who destroy the happiness of others

221
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,919
will never be happy.

222
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,120
That's right.

223
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,375
I think you're calling my boss names.

224
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,519
You bet I am.

225
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,159
Zhu Li!

226
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,120
- Ah?
- Wang Jie!

227
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:32,720
Where is Linlin?

228
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,679
Do you have any idea where she went?

229
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,320
She...

230
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,039
She went back to work on short notice.

231
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,480
It's said that the bracelet's ambassador
is coming.

232
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,759
Don't be upset.

233
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,625
Good things take time.

234
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,600
I know.

235
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,720
Well,

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,159
should I call her right now?

237
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:45,799
No.

238
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,879
It's okay.

239
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,200
Linlin will be back tonight.

240
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,679
You still have many chances.

241
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,000
I hope

242
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,050
you won't tell her about today.

243
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
I'll prepare another proposal.

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,080
I want it to be a surprise.

245
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,950
Okay.

246
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,840
The theme of our shooting is protection.

247
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Protection and strength.

248
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,879
That's why we chose aquamarine

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,960
and bean green color scheme.

250
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,559
Aquamarine?

251
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,200
So it's blue?

252
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,575
Blue makes people look dark.

253
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,360
I think black is good.

254
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,600
It's also very powerful.

255
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,799
Our shooting scheme is made
based on the product...

256
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,440
Oh, right.

257
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,039
Speaking of shooting,

258
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,279
we can only do it in a studio,

259
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,919
because we squeezed time for you.

260
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,519
Shooting on location

261
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,120
might cause unnecessary trouble.

262
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,480
Therefore,

263
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,759
we will leave the hotel for the studio

264
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,440
at 8:30 in the morning.

265
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,000
But we're supposed to start shooting
at 8:30 according to the plan.

266
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,679
The contract says eight hours of work.

267
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,000
We will have been working for you

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,519
since the moment we leave.

269
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,080
What's more,

270
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,320
we need a one-and-a-half-hour

271
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
lunch break.

272
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,840
We must call it a day before 4:30 PM.

273
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,925
Miss Qi.

274
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,279
Our team of designers and directors

275
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,639
worked out the shooting plan
long before the contract was signed.

276
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,080
You confirmed that
when you signed the contract.

277
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,960
Whether it's about the plan
or the shooting schedule,

278
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,200
you'd better

279
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,799
cooperate with our designer.

280
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,440
Losing you won't hurt us.

281
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,159
You're using such a young designer

282
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,840
and asking us to cooperate with you.

283
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,200
You're not our only choice, either.

284
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,840
Well, there's nothing to talk about.

285
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,159
Qi.

286
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,240
Let's do

287
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,600
what the designer says.

288
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,100
Linlin, I'm back.

289
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,375
Why are you staring at me?

290
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,759
I want to make up for

291
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,639
what I have missed.

292
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Cut it out.

293
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,159
You made video calls to me
every few days.

294
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,759
How can that be the same?

295
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,679
I dream about you every single day.

296
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,679
I want to see you
and talk to you like this.

297
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,759
Since you're back,

298
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,440
why didn't you
go to the graduation ceremony?

299
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,879
Isn't my entrance

300
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,240
cooler in this way?

301
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,000
Take a selfie with me.

302
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,080
Why?

303
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,159
To mark the graduation.

304
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,000
Move forward a little bit.

305
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Where's my water glass?

306
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,320
I'll get you some water, Mr. Xiao.

307
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,200
No.

308
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,159
I'll do it myself.

309
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:23,919
Okay. Okay.

310
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,075
Mr. Xiao.

311
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,800
I see you guys have been chatting.

312
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,480
You must be close.

313
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,440
Mr. Xiao, there is no need to guess.

314
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,440
I'll take your advertisement.

315
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,799
The reason is simple.

316
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,159
It's because Linlin is the designer.

317
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,039
It's our honor to have Mr. Wen

318
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,240
as our ambassador.

319
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,759
How about this,

320
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,440
I'll treat you to dinner tonight

321
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,919
and let's celebrate it.

322
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,519
Okay.

323
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
I'll go if Linlin goes.

324
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,879
Linlin, do you have time tonight?

325
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,919
All right.

326
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,279
Make a face.

327
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,120
Make a face. Make a face.

328
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,200
Three, two, one.

329
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,639
She doesn't do it.

330
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,799
- What are you doing?
- All right.

331
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,519
All right, let's do it.

332
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,960
Make a face. Three, two, one.

333
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,720
Take a look.

334
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,360
She is pretty.

335
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,080
One more time.

336
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,850
One more time.

337
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,975
Sorry, I'm late.

338
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,700
This is for you.

339
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,919
Congratulations on your graduation.

340
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,175
Well,

341
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
I forgive you

342
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,080
for the sake of the roses.

343
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,679
Come on, let's take pictures.

344
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,440
Let me take pictures of you.

345
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,960
Come on.

346
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,679
Let me take it.

347
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,200
It's a lot.

348
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,000
It's okay. Take it.

349
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,200
Okay.

350
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,880
Three, two, one.

351
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,640
Alright.

352
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,319
- Done. Take a look.
- Am I pretty?

353
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Stand there. Stand there.

354
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,599
Stand back.

355
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,559
It took us a while
to find the perfect light.

356
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,440
Stand there.

357
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:16,960
Look.

358
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,839
Take a look.

359
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,799
It's great.

360
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,050
We look great.

361
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,950
Beautiful.

362
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,400
What's wrong?

363
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:44,039
No way.

364
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,480
Why not?

365
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,600
Go ahead.

366
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,675
How is it? Do we look good?

367
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:55,759
Yes.

368
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
You...

369
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,119
What have you been doing?

370
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,319
My tutor asked me

371
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,200
to go to the greenhouse.

372
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,200
Your tutor asked you

373
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,249
to go to the greenhouse?

374
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
What do you have in your pocket?

375
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,519
My pocket?

376
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,039
Sorry.

377
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,279
Some wastepaper. I forgot to throw it.

378
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Do you want to keep taking pictures?

379
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,119
Sure.

380
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,720
You take pictures of us.

381
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,125
Come on, give me the bag.

382
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,039
Here.

383
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,960
Take it.

384
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,440
Smile!

385
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,480
Thank God I'm prepared.

386
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,319
I never expect him

387
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,279
to be romantic.

388
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,200
I've always admired your moves.

389
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,400
Happy Graduation Day!

390
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,119
Happy Graduation Day!

391
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,160
- Happy Graduation Day!
- Happy Graduation Day!

392
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,000
Alright.

393
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,640
How's it?

394
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,759
Go.

395
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,640
I want to eat something good.

396
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,079
Can we go to the greenhouse first?

397
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,039
The greenhouse?

398
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,319
Didn't you just go to the greenhouse?

399
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,079
Come on.

400
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,400
Let's go to the greenhouse. Real quick.

401
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,519
Okay.

402
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
We're leaving then.

403
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,000
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

404
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:26,920
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

405
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,839
Thanks!

406
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,450
Let's go.

407
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,875
(Ruting, I love you)

408
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,450
Plantain lily is a shade plant.

409
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,519
Direct sunlight
can make its leaves turn yellow.

410
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,575
Ruting.

411
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,375
You made me feel passionate love.

412
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,325
You took the initiative

413
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,759
in teaching me

414
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,599
how to love someone.

415
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,079
So,

416
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,375
I'll make the first move today.

417
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,720
Plants are most afraid of fire.

418
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,759
But I love your heat.

419
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,200
Will you give me a chance

420
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,119
to let me love you in a clumsy way?

421
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,875
From now on,

422
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
Xie Duanxi will give Ruting

423
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,319
the romance she wants.

424
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,400
Miss Ye.

425
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,720
Will you let me put a ring
on your finger?

426
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,675
Who allowed you to propose to me?

427
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,450
Put it on me right now.

428
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,279
Well?

429
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,400
Am I doing okay?

430
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,450
I'm not very satisfied,

431
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,160
because you ruined

432
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,240
my plan.

433
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,319
Shouldn't I be the one

434
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,440
to do something romantic like proposing?

435
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,900
What to do now?

436
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,640
It's okay,

437
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,799
because I have
a bigger surprise for you.

438
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,625
That's great.

439
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,725
You're still here.

440
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,799
Where else can I go?

441
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,079
I'll just move
from the undergraduate building

442
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,640
to the graduate building
on the opposite.

443
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,440
Linlin rarely comes back.

444
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,759
I want to spend my last beautiful night

445
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,519
in the dorm with you.

446
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,160
I don't want to leave you.

447
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,079
Come on.

448
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,200
Who allowed you to be cliquey?

449
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,440
You're the one talking.

450
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,079
Who spent all day with Xie Duanxi

451
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:46,759
and ignored us?

452
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,039
Is this the first day you met me?

453
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,319
That's how much
I value men over friends.

454
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,350
Three, two, one.

455
00:23:57,825 --> 00:23:58,425
Here.

456
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,880
Your gifts.

457
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,799
Thank you.

458
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,720
My sister.

459
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,799
You're my best sister.

460
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,480
This is my last night being unmarried.

461
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,875
I'll just leave it to my sisters.

462
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,050
Did Xie Duanxi propose to you?

463
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,425
Such a big diamond ring.

464
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,079
Did he also read you a poem?

465
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,359
Read a poem?

466
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,300
What poem?

467
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,559
Nothing.

468
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,960
Wait for me.

469
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,680
Tonight,

470
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,600
let's get really drunk!

471
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:37,600
Eh?

472
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,775
Where are they?

473
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:40,475
They took tomorrow off

474
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,850
to celebrate graduation.

475
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,500
They're outside to play.

476
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,811
Your proposal didn't work out.
I know it must be hard for you.

477
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:57,960
Here.

478
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,075
Have a drink and keep going.

479
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,650
I'm here to cheer you up.

480
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,039
Thank you.

481
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,680
I'll feel better

482
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:10,880
if you are not smiling so hard.

483
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,839
You got Wen Tao

484
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,825
and Xiao Yi.

485
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,200
It has been a hard time for you.

486
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,759
I sympathize.

487
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:20,599
After we graduate,

488
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,920
those who should come back will be back.

489
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,519
And we will meet
whoever we should meet at work.

490
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,319
It's nothing.

491
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,240
What are you gonna do next?

492
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,599
Prepare for the next proposal.

493
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,839
Cheers!

494
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:42,920
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

495
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,720
Why don't I have sweet love?

496
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,450
I think what you want
is a big diamond ring.

497
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,359
Doesn't sweet love

498
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,400
include a diamond ring?

499
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't have sweet love, either.

500
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,559
Well,

501
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,240
learning is your lifelong partner.

502
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:13,375
(Product shooting at 08:30 AM tomorrow.
All staff need to arrive on time.)

503
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,960
By the way,

504
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,160
who is our ambassador in the end?

505
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:19,480
Wen Tao.

506
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,079
Wen Tao?

507
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,359
Wen Tao who?

508
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,799
The Wen Tao you know.

509
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,000
Is Wen Tao back?

510
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,611
Yeah.

511
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,039
Did you go to dinner

512
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,200
alone with Wen Tao tonight?

513
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,450
And also Xiao Yi.

514
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,680
Xiao Yi?

515
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,440
Who is that?

516
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,400
Our boss.

517
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
That immoral man you talked about.

518
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh.

519
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,759
Why?

520
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,850
Did I miss anything interesting?

521
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,799
No.

522
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,240
What's the flavor?

523
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,480
Barbecue.

524
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,640
Do you want more?

525
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,359
(Fang Yuke)
(I'll wait for you at the school gate.)

526
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,200
Try this.

527
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:14,799
Fang Yuke.

528
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,825
Why haven't you
changed your clothes yet?

529
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,079
Did you drink?

530
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,350
A little bit.

531
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,720
You weren't there
when we took graduation photos.

532
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,319
I don't want you
to miss such an important day.

533
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I remember

534
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,300
we took a picture there

535
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,079
four years ago.

536
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,825
Let's take another one today

537
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,799
and finish what we started.

538
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:45,775
Okay.

539
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,160
There's so much
I want to tell you today.

540
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,839
Go on.

541
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,079
Linlin.

542
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,240
I...

543
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,425
Slowly. Slowly.

544
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:17,559
I'll say it later.

545
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,000
Don't worry. Drink less next time.

546
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,720
Over there!

547
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,519
Where?

548
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,079
Isn't that...

549
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,720
Linlin?

550
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,720
Linlin!

551
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,075
Hi!

552
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,519
Linlin!

553
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:35,880
I'm Wang Jie!

554
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,200
- Slow down!
- Slow down!

555
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,150
He...

556
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,279
Hello.

557
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,759
What's wrong with you?

558
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,000
You snuck out of the dorm
when we were drinking.

559
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,839
Tell us.

560
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,400
Are you trying to do something bad
behind our backs?

561
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,000
We are taking pictures. Look.

562
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,625
Take pictures?

563
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,519
Why are you taking pictures now?

564
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,050
To make up for what I missed.

565
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:00,250
Beautiful.

566
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,225
What are you guys doing here?

567
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,475
My girlfriend is here to take pictures.

568
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,839
So I came with her.

569
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,240
Yeah, take pictures.

570
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,799
We haven't taken pictures
with Linlin yet.

571
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,475
Right?

572
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:16,150
Yeah!

573
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,759
Zhou Linlin! Let's go take pictures!

574
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,599
Take pictures!

575
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,039
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

576
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,775
Slow down! Wait for me!

577
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,480
- Slow down.
- Let's go.

578
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,759
- Slow down!
- Slow down!

579
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,400
Let's go!

580
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,359
Wen Tao, why are you here?

581
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,720
How could I not be
in your graduation pictures?

582
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,759
Be honest with me.

583
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,839
Did you inform him?

584
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,359
Linlin said

585
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,440
Wen Tao is back,

586
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,920
so I asked him

587
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,759
where Lin Ze and Chen Chen are.

588
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,680
Then we chatted for a while

589
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,050
and talked about graduation pictures.

590
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,440
What to do now?

591
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,880
I don't care. I'm not very sober now.

592
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,559
Come on.

593
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,920
Let's start with us four girls.

594
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm not sober anyway.

595
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,799
Let's take pictures. The four of us.

596
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,319
Right.

597
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:00,920
Let's take pictures.

598
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,559
Let's take pictures.

599
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,759
You know what to do, right?

600
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,319
Got it.

601
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,319
Hurry.

602
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,880
You like taking pictures at night.

603
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,920
We missed it at the graduation ceremony.

604
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,079
So we're here to take another one.

605
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,759
Right.

606
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,240
It's your style.

607
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,039
You always miss
the most important moment.

608
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,640
I never got a chance to thank you.

609
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,720
Thank me?

610
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,640
For what?

611
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,880
Thank you
for endorsing Linlin's project.

612
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,480
With you on board,

613
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,640
her project will get more attention.

614
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,920
I can do more than that for Linlin,

615
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,960
at least more than what you could do.

616
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,720
What do you mean?

During the epidemic,

619
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,440
why was Linlin quarantined?

620
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,440
Where were you at that time?

621

Fang Yuke.

622
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,519
I gave you a chance,

623
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
but you didn't take it.

624
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,759
You only have one chance.

625
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,319
Those who miss their chance
should be eliminated.

626
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,000
That's why I'm back.

627
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,039
Are you here at night
to talk about this?

628
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,559
Take a look.

629
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,319
Take a look.

We haven't seen each other for ages.

I'll take it off then.
