00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,279
Linlin, what do you want to drink?

170
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,925
I want...

171
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:18,090
This one.

172
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,275
She can't drink alcohol.

173
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,275
What are you doing here?

174
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:29,455
The two of them want
to make friends with...

175
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Her.

176
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,559
No, we want to make friends with this...

177
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,275
We...

178
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,500
Hi.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,879
Sit down.

180
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,500
Come on, sit down.

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,500
It's natural to be nervous

182
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,550
when you meet
the unattainable pretty girl.

183
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,700
That's right!

184
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,075
I'm the girl of your dreams, Zhu Li.

185
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:04,250
Don't be shy.

186
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,025
Are you ready to order?

187
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,359
She'll be fine with milk.

188
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,270
I'm lactose intolerant.

189
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,350
When did you become lactose intolerant?

190
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,189
In my senior year.

191
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,809
I'll have wine.

192
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:17,169
Okay, three glasses
of Long Island Iced Teas.

193
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:18,970
Genius Fang, what would you like?

194
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,169
Would you like their signature wine?

195
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,250
Sober Forgetting Soup.

196
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:31,934
Cheers!

Ah?

200
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,375
Can I invite you over there

201
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,500
to have a drink?

202
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,225
Linlin, I'm going over there
for a drink.

203
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:42,875

What did you just call me?

208
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,330
Madam... Wang.

209
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,300
Where is Zhu Li?

210
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,649
She went over there.

211
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:29,100
Thank you.

212
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:33,700
You already thanked me.

213
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:37,006
You do know how to end a conversation.

214
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,025
It's so annoying.

215

You are inexperienced.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,675
Go away!

Stop drinking.

Did my mom send you here
to keep an eye on me?

Um.

Be careful.

306
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,400
I can walk.

307
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,459
Don't follow me!

308
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,644
Let me take you back.

309
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:35,550
No need.

310
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,285
We used to go back together.

311
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,605
Later, I got used to walking by myself.

312
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,125
From now on...

313
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,659
From now on,
I'm not gonna leave you alone.

314
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,740
I'm tired.

315
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,800
Let me sit down for a while.

316
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,260
I didn't know you are so good now.

317
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,580
You even fought off a rogue.

318
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,625
There was one time on my birthday,

319
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,350
I met a pervert

320
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,960
on the way back home.

321
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,359
I was scared to death.

322
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,421
I hit him as hard as I could.

323
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,600
I hit him so hard.

324
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:58,359
I even broke my favorite skateboard.

325
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
So,

326
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,375
I learned a few moves after that.

327
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,700
I got to kill that pervert.

328
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,925
I'll kill you!

329
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,225
Well?

330
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,650
