Continue.

In fact, I've been wanting

When were you going to tell me?

I wanted to rush there and tell you

when you and Xie Duanxi were
talking about Genius Yu the other day.

But you were gone
by the time I got there.

It wasn't the only chance you missed.

Why didn't you tell me
after the College Entrance Examination?

And when I found you,

46
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,830
why did you ask Xie Duanxi
to pretend to be Genius Yu?

47
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,469
We also took the train

to school together.

49
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,525
You could have told me so many times.

After what happened
at the broadcasting studio,

51
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,320
I never knew how to explain it to you.

52

I know you don't want to see me.

53
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,699
I want to stay by your side
in a different way.

Oh.

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,300
That's why I used the name Genius Yu.

59
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,975
I thought it was the best way.

60

Genius Yu.

61
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:38,794
I don't like being the last one

62

to know the truth.

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,575
If you respect me,

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
you should have told me the truth.

I'm gonna go back.

68

Linlin, let me take you home.

69

I can go back myself.

Why am I allowed
to go in there this time?

85
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,075
Because I wasn't ready last time.

They usually glow at night

to attract insects
to spread spores for them.

What does that mean?

97
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,436
It means that they use light

I can't accept the fact
that he lied to me again and again.

It bothers you because you care.

isn't that kind of romantic?

No matter how romantic it is,
it's still a lie.

You must be tired

We're waiting for you. Come on.

Come on.

Yuke.

449
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,880
Earlier, I asked you

450
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,319
to take care of our Linlin.

451
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,240
I hope it's not too much trouble.

452
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,075
Not at all.

453
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,480
That's what I should do, Aunt.

454
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,480
Mom, I don't need anyone
to take care of me.

455
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,480
You two grew up together.

456
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't make it sound like
Fang is a stranger.

457
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:49,200
Linlin.

458
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:50,904
Since you're in college now,

459
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,050
you should also hang out
with new friends.

460
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,310
Hang out?

461
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,720
You should still study hard
even in college.

462
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,575
Got it?

463
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,960
Good health is the most important thing.

464
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,275
What do you know?

465
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,880
When you have time, ask Wen Tao

466
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,759
to teach you how to play tennis.

467
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,559
Get some exercise. It's no problem.

468
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,279
Wen Tao.

469
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,519
- Okay.
- Okay, Uncle.

470
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,440
Zhou, go to the kitchen
and get the dumplings.

471
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:14,825
Dumplings?

472
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,125
You guys eat first. Go ahead.

473
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,119
The dumplings aren't ready yet.

474
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,175
What are you doing?

475
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,825
Selling our daughter?

476
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,680
Was that how you find your daughter
a boyfriend?

477
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,359
But, you're no better than me.

478
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,839
What's wrong with me?
At least we know Fang.

479
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,075
If they could have been together,
they would have been together.

480
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,119
Your daughter was a high school student.

481
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,680
Have you heard how unreasonable it is?

482
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,359
How is it unreasonable?

483
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,079
Stop talking!

484
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,331
From now on,

485
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,559
you do what I say. Do you hear me?

486
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,039
Okay.

487
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,075
Go!

488
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,119
Come on.

489
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,025
Try the dumplings your aunt made.

490
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:05,526
Dumplings.

491
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,400
Uncle, Aunt.

492
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,319
Thank you for your hospitality
at our first meeting.

493
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,225
These are some tickets
to my tennis match.

494
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,750
These tickets are not easy to get.

495
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,810
I'll take them.

496
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:17,850
Uncle.

497
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,101
I'll go fishing with you tomorrow.

498
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,200
Uncle, I'm the best at fishing.

499
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,000
I'll go with you.

500
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,880
I know the way there. I'll go with you.

501
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,359
I have more strength. I'll go.

502
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,160
You...

503
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,839
Yuke, you don't know how to fish.

504
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:31,680
I...

505
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,680
Wen Tao, why don't you come with me?

506
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,450
Okay.

507
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,519
Wen Tao, you and your uncle

508
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,925
hit it off.

509
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
It's not a big deal.

510
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
You both can go if you want to.

511
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,519
Just eat dumplings.

512
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,475
- Well, Wen Tao.
- Yes.

513
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:57,156
Well,

514
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,920
stay here tonight.

515
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,880
We can go fishing
together tomorrow, okay?

516
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,640
Okay.

517
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Yuke.

518
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,680
Your mother just told me

519
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,225
she won't be at home tonight.

520
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:06,984
How about you stay here, too?

521
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,450
Okay.

522
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,450
Linlin, can I stay here?

523
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,970
Sure. I'm fine with it.

524
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,125
No problem.

525
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,244
Here, Yuke. Have dumplings.

526
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,240
Thank you, Aunt.

527
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,799
The filling is mackerel. It's delicious.

528
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,599
Here. Have some dumplings.

529
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,375
Thank you, Uncle.

530
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,920
Come on, eat more.

531
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Who is Wen Tao? What's going on here?

532
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,225
Don't worry about it.

533
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:43,050
We've sent Wen Tao away.

534
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,759
The most important thing right now

535
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,079
is that there is still misunderstanding

536
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:49,855
between them.

537
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,525
They don't even talk now.

538
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,525
Let's eat together tomorrow

539
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,880
and let them clear the misunderstanding

540
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,559
on the table.

541
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,039
I wish it could be that easy.

542
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,720
I know Linlin too well.

543
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:04,300
She is too stubborn
to be told what to do.

544
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:06,139
Will she listen to us?

545
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,039
Right.

546
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,759
Well, my son

547
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,119
talks less when there are more people.

548
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,100
I have an idea.

549
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,680
Well, these two kids

550
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,799
just need a chance to talk,

551
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,350
right?

552
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,950
Yeah.

553
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,075
How about this,

554
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,339
let's reserve a table
in a restaurant for tomorrow.

555
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,825
You bring Fang Yuke there.

556
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,359
And I'll try to get Linlin there.

557
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,640
You and I are going
to fight at the table,

558
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,300
and they will try to stop us.

559
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,680
Then they will start talking.

560
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,359
That's when we can leave.

561
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,700
Can it work?

562
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,440
Do you have a better idea?

563
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,920
There's nothing better to do.

564
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,920
Here is the deal.

565
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,440
No matter what we say at the table,

566
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,475
we can't get mad.

567
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,319
Pinky swear.

568
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,359
Oh, my good sister.

569
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,079
We've known each other
for over a decade.

570
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't you know me?

571
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,200
Am I that kind of person?

572
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,000
All of this...

573
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,119
- Is for the kids.
- Is for the kids.

574
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,275
Are you sleepwalking again?

575
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,925
Don't forget what happened yesterday.

576
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,021
I haven't gotten back at you yet.

577
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,619
I want to have a good rest
during the holiday.

578
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,119
I want you both to disappear

579
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,680
when I get up tomorrow morning.

580
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,625
Can you just sleep?

581
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,319
It's finally quiet.

582
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,625
Hello, Mom.

583
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,100
Linlin.

584
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,079
I left something at home.

585
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,200
Can you bring it to me?

586
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,559
I've sent you the address on WeChat.

587
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,400
That's it.

588
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,375
Well done.

589
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,475
Do you know what to do later?

590
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,600
Keep it in mind.

591
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,331
Don't worry.

592
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,500
- A big fish took the bait!
- We got a fish!

593
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,000
Well...

594
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,119
Come on!

595
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,319
Wen Tao, help me!

596
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:57,839
Okay.

597
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,559
What a big fish.

598
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,675
It's so big.

599
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:06,880
Hurry, take a picture of it
for your aunt.

600
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,480
Take a picture.

601
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,150
Okay.

602
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,700
Come on.

603
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,599
Let's take a selfie.

604
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,825
Hold it up a little higher.

605
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,559
One, two, three.

606
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:19,875
How wonderful.

607
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,240
The wild fishing area is really good.

608
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
There are more kinds of fish,

609
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,119
and I never caught a fish this big

610
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,200
in the Houhe Reservoir before.

611
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:27,920
Really?

612
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,279
Yeah, yeah. That's great.

613
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,175
Come on. Let's continue.

614
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,050
Is she coming?

615
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,050
Linlin.

616
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,725
Hello, Aunt.

617
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,799
I'm here to drop off something
for my mom.

618
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,160
Come here. Put it there.

619
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,039
My mom is always forgetful.

620
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,225
Put it here. Put it here.

621
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,960
You lied to me.

622
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,920
How is that lying?

623
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
I did leave something at home.

624
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:00,900
Linlin.

625
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
I haven't met you for a long time.

626
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,900
- Come here. Let me take a look at you.
- Aunt.

627
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,925
It's been a long time.

628
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,559
I'll visit you sometime.

629
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,960
Well, you guys eat. I'm leaving.

630
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,050
- Don't go!
- Don't go!

631
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,325
Since you're here,

632
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:11,639
and I've ordered many delicious dishes.

633
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,800
Just sit down and eat with me.

634
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,239
- I'm not very hungry, Aunt.
- Right?

635
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,400
What do you mean?

636
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,159
Do you not want to eat with me?

637
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,320
It's not what I mean.

638
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,599
Well, sit down and eat some.

639
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,199
I miss you, you know?

640
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,625
All right. Sit down.

641
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,800
Let's eat. Come on.

642
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,225
These are your favorite dishes.

643
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,721
Have more.

644
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,850
Are we not waiting for Zhou?

645
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:40,480
Well, I forgot to tell you.

646
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,760
Zhou went fishing with that young man.

647
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,679
Why did you say it
with a sarcastic tone?

648
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,679
You did everything.

649
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,840
Can't I even talk about it?

650
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,440
You said you like Fang Yuke,

651
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,440
but secretly, he took some other boy
to go fishing.

652
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,440
What does that mean?
How two-faced you are.

653
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,679
It's your son, Fang Yuke,
who suggested going fishing.

654
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,425
Right?

655
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,119
What does it have to do with me?

656
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,760
Just eat. Don't look for trouble.

657
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,039
What do you mean
I'm looking for trouble?

658
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,719
Watch your mouth.

659
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,360
If you have a problem with me,
just say it.

660
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,840

- How could you not know?
- What did my son do?

Why did our daughter
transfer to another school?

It was because of your son, Fang Yuke!

What's wrong with my son?

She went to that school
for less than six months.

would she get admitted to college?

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,875
Uncle, the bucket is full!

00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:39,725
Okay.

831
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,189
Is the bucket full?

832
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:46,990
Yes.

833
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:48,675
There are more in the tent.

834
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,650
Come on.

835
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,320
Uncle.

836
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,600
Are you gonna fill all these buckets
before you go back?

837
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,400
That's right.

838
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,199
Your aunt was kind enough

839
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:01,725
and signed us up for a fishing trip.

840
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:03,926
We have to fully enjoy
the two days and one night.

841
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,440
Are you in a hurry to leave?

842
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,599
No. No hurry.

843
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,039
I mean, you can go first
if you have something else to do.

844
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:11,950
It's okay. No rush.

845
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,600
I like fishing best.

846
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,679
Good. What are you still waiting for?

847
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,625
- Let's go fishing!
- Yeah.

848
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:31,644
It's all closed.

849
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:33,724
Don't worry.

850
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:36,850
Give me a second!

851
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,750
It's all closed.

852
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,275
What do we do?

853
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,200
Don't worry.

854
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:09,000
I saved Director Wang's phone number.

855
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,360
We've been stuck here for four hours.

856
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,515
Good friends share weal and woe.

857
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,800
Hold it.

858
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,590
Why are you doing
on the roof on holiday?

859
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,070
You'd have spent the night up there

860
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,189
if I hadn't been here!

861
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,910
Director, perfect timing every time.

862
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,000
What?

863
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,725
Zhou Linlin?

864
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,039
What are you doing here?

865
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,425
You two are dating.

866
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,760
Director, you took it wrong.

867
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,760
We are good friends.

868
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,875
Good friends?

869
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,679
Your good friend

870
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,000
even gave up Qing University's
admission eligibility.

871
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,950
Director.

872
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:57,300
Gave up admission eligibility?

873
00:46:58,725 --> 00:47:00,165
After what happened
at the broadcasting studio,

874
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:02,320
Fang Yuke came to me countless times,

875
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,900
trying to take the fall for you.

876
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,375
He even gave up Qing University.

877
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,320
Director.

878
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:09,100
All right, all right.

879
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:10,480
Just go home now!

880
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,700
Goodbye, Director.

881
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,700
Goodbye, Director.

882
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,650
Let's go.

883
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,719
Fang Yuke.

884
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,300
Why did you do that?

885
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:34,125
Good friends

886
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,950
share weal and woe.

887
00:47:52,348 --> 00:47:59,788
(September 14, 2015
Grade One of High school)

888
00:47:59,788 --> 00:48:03,199
(Little Theater of Unrequited love)

889
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:04,025
Hold on.

890
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:09,625
Are your nails broken?

891
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,519
What's this?

892
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,119
Considering you never look at the road
when you're reading,

893
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,125
I made a helmet for your thumb.

894
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,750
Zhou Linlin.

895
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:29,159
You have so many strange ideas

896
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,975
What are you going to do in the future?

897
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,719
Become a great designer

898
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,025
like Philippe Starck.

899
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,639
I asked about it.

900
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,920
Southern University's industrial design
ranks first in China.

901
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,639
I'll set up a pancake stand
at Southern University.

902
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:42,920
Then I can audit classes
and sell pancakes at the same time.

903
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:48,239
Can you be more ambitious?

904
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,375
Can't you just get admitted
to Southern University?

905
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,840
Isn't your dream
to study computer engineering

906
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,119
at Qing University?

907
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,159
If I have a pancake stand,

908
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:56,039
I can shuttle between

909
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,450
Qing University and Southern University.

910
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,950
Don't worry. You got me.

911
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,050
You're making it sound like

912
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,530
you can take the test for me.

913
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:15,159
I can help you with your study.

914
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,079
All you think about is studying.

915
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,800
Will we be able to make a lot of money

916
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,525
if we set up a pancake stand together?

917
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,599
Sure we will.

918
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,639
Are you nuts?

919
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,000
You can smile if you want to.

920
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,760
Or others would think there are weights
hanging on the corners of your mouth.

921
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:31,125
I don't want to smile.

922
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,300
Do it again!

923
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,575
Do you want to smile?

924
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,079
Will you smile or not?

925
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,519
I'm asking you to smile.

926
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,360
You're nuts.

927
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:45,679
Yes. It's great, isn't it?

928
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,360
Smile. Three, two, one.
