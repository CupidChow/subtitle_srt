Get up.

How can I explain
that I'm in your apartment?

404
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,720
Prof. Chen, wait a minute, please.

405
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,960
I...

406
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,925
Any excuse.

407
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,625
I'm naked.

408
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,850
Now it's harder to explain.

409
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,000
You...

410
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,325
Fang Yuke!

411
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,880
Why does it take him
so long to get dressed?

412
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,825
Prof. Chen,

413
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,599
Fang Yuke has broken his arm.

414
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,800
He has trouble getting dressed.

415
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,759
Yes. His arm is broken.

416
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,150
Prof. Chen.

417
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
Thank you, ma'am.

418
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,000
So much for the cleaning. You should go.

419
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,720
Who's this?

420
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,920
The cleaner I hired.

421
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,920
Is this...

422
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,800
- It's mine.
- ...yours?

423
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,920
When I wear this, I feel refreshed.

424
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,079
It's perfect for homework time.

425
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,720
I'm glad you like it.

426
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,440
Come in, please.

427
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,325
Wait.

428
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,175
You...

429
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,225
Do you have a name card?

430
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,440
I need a cleaner, too.

431
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,200
Umm...

432
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,519
I don't have a name card.

433
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,839
Your phone number will also do.

434
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,975
Give me your number.

435
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,050
Sorry, Prof. Chen.

436
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,039
She's Zhou Linlin.

437
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,400
Sorry, Prof. Chen.

438
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,325
I'm to blame.

439
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,400
I just didn't want you
to misunderstand us.

440
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,119
Is your arm all right?

441
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes. Thank you for your concern.

442
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,160
I came today
as I have something important

443
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,039
to discuss with you.

444
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,759
Be seated.

445
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:43,750
Okay.

446
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,359
Recently,

447
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,050
school has started the 827 Project

448
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,119
that will last for one year.

449
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,920
I worked out a list of several members.

450
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,000
You're on the list.

451
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,440
I don't need to explain

452
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,925
- how important this project is, right?
- Mm.

453
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,400
I mostly want to ask

454
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,720
about your second degree.

455
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,519
Umm...

456
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,079
Prof. Chen,

457
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,200
I don't want to give up
my second degree.

458
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,160
But once the project starts,

459
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,725
you'll be very busy.

460
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,160
I don't want the second degree

461
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,150
to distract you.

462
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,725
Why don't you think about it?

463
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Fang Yuke will do it.

464
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,440
He'll certainly
cherish this opportunity.

465
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,759
Say it.

466
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,720
I'll think it over and get back to you.

467
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,240
Fine.

468
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,480
I'll be waiting.

469
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,279
Let me walk you out.

470
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,000
Don't bother.

471
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,475
Why don't you join them?

472
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,325
I don't want to give up
my second degree.

473
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,640
Such a good project
isn't always available.

474
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,920
Prof. Chen came personally.

475
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
You must participate.

476
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,079
I want to take classes with you.

477
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,759
But we still have plenty of time

478
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,825
to stay together.

479
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,075
I mean

480
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,319
if you really like industrial design,

481
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,279
I can help you make up the lessons.

482
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,640
Fang Yuke, in my eyes,

483
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,759
always sticks to what he wants.

484
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,680
Once he has a goal,

485
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,850
he keeps moving towards it.

486
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:40,250
Mm.

487
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:42,640
Prof. Chen.

488
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,640
Prof. Chen,

489
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,875
I apply to join the 827 Project.

490
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,119
What are you reading?

491
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,300
(Starck Master Class begins!)
Starck Master Class.

492
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,960
Next year, one quota will
be available in Asia.

493
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,799
Wang Jie just doesn't give up.

494
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,799
We've submitted many designs.

495
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,375
But there has been no response.

496
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,450
In this world,

497
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,960
does anyone not want

498
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,079
to attend Starck Master Class?

499
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,359
That's true.

500
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,039
But we can't go just because we want it.

501
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,599
I've also applied several times.

502
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,160
Anyway, if I can't succeed by tiptoeing,

503
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,240
I'll try jumping.

504
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,200
You make sense.

505
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,225
- I'm back.
- Mm?

506
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,525
Such a rare visitor.

507
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,300
At last, you're back.

508
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,799
How was your trip to the countryside?
Have you succeeded?

509
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,039
It wasn't a tiny success.

510
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,119
It was a super success.

511
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,500
I've brought presents for you.

512
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,050
Thank you.

513
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,559
I also hope

514
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,240
that you'll be in love soon.

515
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,550
What does this mean?

516
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,440
She's in a relationship with Xie Duanxi.

517
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,840
I've got a date later.

518
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,350
I came back to drop off my trunk.

519
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,320
Linlin,

520
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,280
how is it going between you
and Fang Yuke?

521
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,599
Oh, you still have time
to care about me?

522
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,039
I get to know anything
I'm interested in.

523
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,760
Nothing can stop me.

524
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,599
Tell me, then.

525
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,880
Yeah, tell us.

526
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,679
We asked several times
and she said nothing.

527
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,320
I said, nothing happened since then.

528
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,280
What can I say?

529
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,440
Are you sure?

530
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,880
But on the camping night,

531
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,599
Fang Yuke rushed

532
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,840
into Xie Duanxi's home

533
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,360
in case Xie Duanxi took you away.

534
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,039
He went to see Xie Duanxi?

535
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,320
What did they talk about?

536
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,280
You want to know that?

537
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,760
Tell me about your relationship first.

538
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,360
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

539
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,599
Don't forget, in the caravan,

540
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,760
I saw you "watch a movie".

541
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,039
We're besties, you know.

542
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Fine. Fine.

543
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,079
When we camped at the beach,

544
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
in the middle of the night,

545
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,000
Fang Yuke rushed
into Xie Duanxi's home

546
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,079
and said he loved you

547
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,679
and wanted to chase you.

548
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,039
He was very scared that Xie Duanxi

549
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,320
had feelings for you.

550
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,519
So, he warned Xie Duanxi.

551
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,800
Is that true?

552
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,000
What are you going to do, then?

553
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,599
It's my own business.

554
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,600
I'll handle it by myself.

555
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:32,880
Linlin.

556
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,519
What are you doing? You freaked me out.

557
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,079
The game will start soon.

558
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,599
I'm taking confined training.

559
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,119
My coach has been watching me

560
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,400
as if I were a criminal.

561
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,360
If I didn't disguise myself,

562
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,320
I couldn't come out.

563
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,480
Now that you're under confined training,

564
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,559
do not come out.

565
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,800
Your coach does everything
for your own good.

566
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,679
Don't always oppose him.

567
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,840
It's not that I oppose him.

568
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,320
When I work hard, I deserve to relax.

569
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,119
On my team,

570
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,280
I've been practicing tennis very hard.

571
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,679
Even if my coach knows it,

572
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,360
he will understand me.

573
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,500
Hello, Coach.

574
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,360
Hello.

575
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,575
Coach,

576
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
please let me go.

577
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,639
I've been practicing for so many days.

578
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,950
I promise you.

579
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,199
I'll just go for dinner

580
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:13,960
and I'll be right back.

581
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,840
I won't be argued with!

582
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,199
I know very well about you.

583
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,599
When you're out of my sight,
you'll be gone.

584
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,559
Go back with you.

585
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,519
Linlin...

586
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
Go back to training.

587
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,159
I've got something to handle, too.

588
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,880
Let's meet after your training is over.

589
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,840
All right, then.

590
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,480
Wait for me.

591
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,400
I'll come to you
as soon as the training is over.

592
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,000
Mm.

593
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,850
You've got guts, huh?

594
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,800
Double today's amount of training.

595
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,550
Do you hear me?

596
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,400
Yes.

597
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,225
Linlin, wait for me, then.

598
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,320
Off you go.

599
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,150
Run!

600
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,000
(Don't pretend you didn't see that.)

601
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:09,411
(My design was rejected
by Mr. Gu today.)

602
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,159
(He said it wasn't practical.)

603
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,880
(I'm starting to modify it.)

604
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,925
(Pay attention to that, too.)

605
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,275
Practical?

606
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,639
Okay?

607
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,275
Cool.

608
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
I just thought of something.

609
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
When you can't even tickle your back,

610
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,900
how can you take a bath?

611
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,300
I can, after the cast is removed.

612
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:10,920
What are you doing?

613
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,000
What are you designing?

614
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,950
So mysterious.

615
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,840
You'll know.

616
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,239
The automatic bath brush I designed is

617
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,639
different from traditional bath brushes

618
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,840
in three aspects.

619
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,440
First, the material.

620
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,440
I collocated four kinds of bristles

621
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,039
and adjusted their angles.

622
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,800
Full consideration has been given

623
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
to users' demands
for different body parts.

624
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,840
Second, the usage pattern.

625
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,400
I designed three levels of power,

626
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,760
separately corresponding

627
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,225
to three different
cleaning effects and modes.

628
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,119
My automatic bath brush

629
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,199
gives full consideration

630
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,679
to those who have physical disabilities.

631
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,960
So, I simplified its operation steps

632
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,360
as much as I can,

633
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,559
hoping it will give these special people

634
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,480
a convenient and comfortable experience.

635
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:00,975
Very good.

636
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,360
This design

637
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,880
has given full consideration
to the physical and mental needs

638
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,920
of the disabled.

639
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:07,760
Interesting.

640
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,625
Zhou Linlin,

641
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,239
I have something to ask you.

642
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,679
How did you come up

643
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,375
with this automatic bath brush?

644
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,440
A friend of mine got hurt.

645
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,719
He has trouble taking a bath.

646
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
So, I designed this.

647
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,025
Oh.

648
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,039
What a coincidence!
Fang Yuke is hurt, too.

649
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:35,960
When your brush is manufactured,

650
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,199
ask him to try it.

651
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,239
In this way,

652
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,199
you can collect his feedback.

653
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,100
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Gu.

654
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:45,725
(Does not ache or itch.)

655
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,275
Mr. Gu.

656
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,875
Waiting for Zhou Linlin?

657
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,825
Your arm...

658
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,280
It does not ache or itch?

659
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,375
Mm.

660
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,225
Fine. Just wait.

661
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,440
Zhou Linlin.

662
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,575
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

663
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,250
Thank you

664
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,500
for the automatic bath brush

665
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,375
you designed for your good friend.

666
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,639
I'm a patient, Zhou Linlin!

667
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,025
(Yes! You! The design competition
waits for you to participate!)

668
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,425
Is it heavy?

669
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:54,936
Thank you

670
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,625
for what you designed for me.

671

673
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,760
you should collect
my feedback carefully.

674

I'll experience it

for as long as I can.

679

Didn't I ask you to leave without me?

how could we hear
such a sweet conversation?

683

Come on, Fang Yuke.

684
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,400
You've been sticking together
for quite a long time.

685
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,119
Leave Zhou Linlin to us for one night,

686
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:31,900
okay?

687

You can't say no.

We want Zhou Linlin right here and now.

Okay.

Be honest.

When did you start a relationship?

694

We...

695
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,725
We're just friends.

00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,650
Ah?

697
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,840
You're rather slow.

698
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,800
You should set a schedule

699

and move onto the next stage quickly.

700

Tell me the truth.

Do you or do you not like Fang Yuke?

You must treat us to a big meal.

709

Right.

We'll have the final exam soon.
Aren't you anxious?

714
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,280
A dinner will not delay anything.

715
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,039
But I'm anxious.

716
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,000
Put it aside until the exam is over.

717

I'll treat you to a nice dinner then.

718

We want Fang Yuke to treat us to dinner.

719
