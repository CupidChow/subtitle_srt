Yes.

I'll tell him when we have the hotpot

Will Zhou Linlin suddenly
not go to France?

That's impossible.

According to Tao,

68
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,080
Zhou Linlin admires Starck most.

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,100

no longer see them get baffled

All right.

to wipe your tears for Wen Tao?

85
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,850
The tissues are for Fang Yuke.

Zhou Linlin abandoned Fang Yuke.

Wen Tao

What can I help you with?

111
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,600
Take care of all this.

what specifically will you do?

Tell us about it earlier.

115
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,000
I haven't made up my mind yet.

116
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:50,750
Then why do you gather so many people?

117
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,680
Keep your voice down.

118
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,839
I just want to know

119
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,575
what Fang Yuke thinks of it.

120
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,920
With more friends around,

121
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,279
I'll be less embarrassed.

122
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,160
You're always straightforward,
aren't you?

123
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,650
I didn't know you could also be scared.

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,200
It has nothing to do with that.

125
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,250
Under such circumstances,

126
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,875
no one knows what to do.

127
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,120
After you know what he thinks,

128
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,200
what are you going to do?

129
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,839
If he asks me to stay, I'll stay.

130
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,875
For Fang Yuke,

131
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,050
you will reject Starck?

132
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,360
What if he doesn't ask you to stay?

133
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,560
That's not going to happen.

134
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you,

135
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,400
Fang Yuke's spokesman?

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,839
That's Fang Yuke.

137
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,439
He loves Zhou Linlin so much.

138
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,550
He'll in no way give up on her.

139
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,279
It's hard to tell.

140
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,800
In this world,

141
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,600
no one can override Starck,

including Fang Yuke.

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,399
Let me get this straight.

144
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,519
If Fang Yuke gives up on Zhou Linlin,

145

from this day on,

146
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,800
I'll no longer be Gorgeous.

147
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,040
No one calls you Gorgeous, anyway.

148
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
You call yourself that.

149
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,875
You already know what to do, right?

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,550
Here, Linlin.

151
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,959
Have some tofu.

152
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,000
Gorgeous, switch seats with me, okay?

153
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,075
Not now.

154
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,959
Why?

155
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,040
Stop it.

156
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,100
Everybody,

157
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,875
I have something to tell you.

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,800
I got the offer of Starck Master Class.

159

Wait.

165
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
This is such important news.

166
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,160
Shouldn't you say it after dinner?

167
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,650
Isn't it inappropriate

168
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,975
to say it now?

169
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,600
Linlin isn't done talking yet.

170

Linlin,

171
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,150
congratulations.

172
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,150
Here's the second piece of good news.

173
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to France, too.

174
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,080
Fang Yuke,

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,175
a toast to you.

176
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,800
Thank you for encouraging me.

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,775
Congratulations, Linlin.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,519
I know you've been preparing
for a long time.

179
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,050
Now you'll get what you want.

180
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,575
That's enough of that.

181
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,080
Here's the third piece of good news.

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
Ruting and Duanxi

183
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,679
have been in a relationship.

184
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,320
Give it up for them.

185
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,120
- Nice.
- Nice.

186
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
Ruting,

187
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
tell us what happened.

188
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,825
I said I was going to Germany.

189
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,360
Xie Duanxi got to the airport
without hesitation

190
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,450
and bought the flight ticket.

191
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,320
He said whether I wanted
to stay or leave,

192
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,120
he would be with me.

193
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Fang Yuke,

194
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,261
you haven't congratulated me, have you?

195
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,480
You...

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,000
Congratulations, Wen Tao.

197
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,159
Don't worry.

198
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,450
I'll take good care of Linlin.

199
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,480
Well, just drink a little.

200
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,400
Boss.

201
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,120
Enough, enough.

202
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,350
Boss, that's enough of it. Stop.

203
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,440
Don't drink alone.

204
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,559
Let's drink together. Come on.

205
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

206
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
- What?
- Congratulations, Linlin.

207
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,325
- Congratulations, everybody.
- What are you waiting for?

208
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,320
- Congratulations, Tao.
- Cheers.

209
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,639
- Come on. Bottom up.
- Come on.

210
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,480
Bottom up.

211
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,279
Congratulations.

212
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,375
What are you doing? Keep drinking.

213
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,677
Congrats. Congrats.

214
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,706
I can drink more.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Linlin, let's go to Paris together.

216
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,750
Let's fly.

217
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:08,775
- I'm so happy.
- Okay. Okay.

218
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:09,450
Be careful. Be careful.

219
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,440
- I can drink more.
- Let's get back.

220
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,625
I can drink more.

221
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,200
Go, go, go. Let's get back.

222
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,875
I'm hot.

223
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,639
Fang Yuke.

224
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,925
I'm going to Paris soon.

225
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,600
Do you

226
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,200
have nothing to tell me?

227
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,919
I support the decision you made.

228
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,025
Aren't you supposed to ask me to stay?

229
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,519
I know you admire Starck.

230
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,840
I support your decision
to pursue your dream.

231
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,700
Say congratulations to me, officially.

232
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,799
I'm really going to France.

233
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,080
Linlin is disappointed in love.

234
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,350
Why are you so annoyed?

235
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,919
I used to think

236
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,475
Fang Yuke was a good man.

237
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,120
How could he do this to Linlin?

238
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,559
He's so annoying!

239
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,200
Actually,

240
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,425
this isn't bad.

241
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,100
I mean

242
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,679
this is good timing to stop losing more.

243
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,450
Linlin still has Wen Tao
and Starck Master Class.

244
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,075
Fang Yuke loved you.

245
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,175
But today, he didn't ask you to stay.

246
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,975
Things can't be that simple.

247
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,175
Come on, Ruting.

248
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,840
Which side are you on?

249
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,320
Fang Yuke may be a bad influence.

250
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Be very careful.

251
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,480
Perhaps Xie Duanxi

252
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,625
will not be nice, either.

253
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,100
What?

254
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,750
Can't I even complain about Xie Duanxi?

255
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm going to make a phone call.

256
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,425
Everything will be all right.

I'm giving you
a hard but glorious mission.

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,919
We can't meet again
until one year later.

264
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,600
Tonight will be our celebration night.

265
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,039
Cheers.

266

What did you do?

269
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,360
Ruting yelled at me,

270
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
saying she would break up with me

271
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,050
unless I broke with you first.

272
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,175
How did you upset them?

273
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,475
Linlin is going to France.

274
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,650
I didn't ask her to stay.

(Ask her to give up for me?)

280

I wouldn't do such a thing.

281
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,925
If you were me,

282
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,125
what would you do?

283
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,919
She'll be in France for only a year.

284
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,825
She admires Starck most.

285

I was so scared.

Where are you going?

290
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,079
It'll be such an important occasion.

Are you going with swollen eyes?

292

See how you look now.

- by some freshman.
- Mm.

299
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,160
How will you profess love?

Let us help you rehearse.

Okay.

Are we going home?

303
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm not leaving.

304
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,240
You go back home without me.

305
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,759
I'll accompany Linlin tonight.

What am I?

Your tool?

308

Yes.

309
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,519
You did a very good job, though.

310
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,225
Any rewards?

311
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,559
Yes, of course.

312
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,800
One for the mission

313
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,300
and the other for your coming
all the way here.

314
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,750
Is the mission worth it?

315

Let's be together.

What do you think?

322
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,519
So straightforward and unromantic.

323
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,359
Pass.

324
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,319
So boring

325
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,319
and so forgettable.

326
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,039
Pass.

327
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,400
Pass, too.

328
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,425
It's way too simple.

How about starting
with your first meeting?

Fang Yuke,

331
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,359
since I met you for the first time,

332

you've been deeply ingrained

333

into my mind.

334
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,925
When did you meet for the first time?

335
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,000
At the age of eight.

336
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,400
I caught two caterpillars then.

337
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,079
I can tell you from personal experience.

338

how I can help you.

345

Did you agree to do something but fail?

346

Or did any of you profess love
but not succeed?

347
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,720
Fang Yuke professed love to you, right?

348

Which one shall I answer?

350

Now that he professed love to you,

351
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,800
all you need to do is one thing.

352
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,119
Create another occasion

353
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,519
to profess feelings for him.

354
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,000
Then everything will
fall into place, right?

Nothing.

I...

686
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:00,875
Fang Yuke,

687
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,199
you always take the first step.

688
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,525
Let me do it this time.

689
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,039
When I met you for the first time,

690
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:14,135
I never expected

691
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:15,975
that a caterpillar

692
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:18,734
made us friends for so many years.

693
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,535
I watched you solve Rubik's Cube
too many times.

694
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,975
I fed you
too many pieces of lemon candy.

695
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:29,254
You shared your dream with me.

696
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:32,655
You like every strange invention
of mine.

697
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,079
And those things in your bedroom...

698
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,396
I saw them.

699
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,425
Zhou Linlin Museum, I mean.

700
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,325
You love me more than I imagined.

701
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:56,115
You've carefully preserved

702
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
every memory we had together.

703
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,985
What you've done makes me believe

704
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,679
that someone in this world

705
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:08,126
indeed knows more about me,

706
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,625
protects me more,

707
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,231
and loves me more than myself.

708
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,760
I'm more surprised

709
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,625
that I fell in love with you
a long time ago.

710
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
My understated feelings were...

711
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,825
(Option D: Judging from the question...)

712
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:30,050
...hidden in the exercise books
you provided for me,

713
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,480
in the hangover capsule you gave me,

714
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,840
on the beach
where we watched the sunrise,

715
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,085
and in the torrential rain.

716
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,221
You've been everywhere in my world.

717
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:50,316
But I didn't realize that until now.

718
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,325
So, even if I'm leaving soon,

719
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:56,925
I still want to tell you
that I love you.

720
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,075
Even if there are times zones
and thousands of kilometers between us,

721
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,830
even if I don't want to leave
and life might be hard,

722
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,610
I still want to experience it with you.

723
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,520
If in my life,

724
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,890
I could get crazy for love,

725
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,894
I want to love you.

726
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,575
Fang Yuke,

727
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,031
I love you.

728
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,800
Zhou Linlin,

729
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,280
I will always be with you.

730
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:38,960
I love you.
