It's time for me to know some men.

104

Also, those who go to the party

105
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,160
are mostly excellent men.

113
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,639
You can at least hold hands
and spin around, right?

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Keep pace with the beat

He bought me the bouquet anonymously.

223
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,320
It can estimate

and establish the database.

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,320
I'll say no more.

Or have we not found them yet?

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,759
and taste the romance.

336
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,359
Take up your partner's arm

337
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,279
and enjoy a memorable evening.

338
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
Next comes the dancing part.

339
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,440
A special tip for you.

340
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,720
When the music varies,

341
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,119
you can follow the beat

342
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,000
and change the partner
with those around you.

343
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,400
Have a good time, everyone.

344
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,519
Here comes the first piece of music.

345
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,200
Hope you'll dance happily
and enjoy the romance.

346
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:07,960
Zhou Linlin,

347
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,920
why don't you dance at the party?

348
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,079
If you can't dance,

349
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,640
let me teach you.

350
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,640
Hello, man.

351
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,319
Who are you?

352
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,319
I'm Fang Yuke,
from the School of Computer Science.

353
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,599
I'm Zhou Linlin's partner.

354
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,519
I have something to tell you.

355
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,839
I'm not your partner.

356
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:38,300
(Calculating...)

357
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,575
(Height: 185cm, Match rate: 86%)

358
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,400
(Meet the set standards)

359
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,799
Congrats. You're basically qualified.

360
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,759
Next, please tell me

361
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,839
your family background,
health condition,

362
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,759
fertility expectancy,
requirements for your wife,

363
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,759
and sexual orientation.

364
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,960
Don't worry.

365
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,160
Even if the above information
is recorded,

366
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,400
I will not tell anyone else
even a single word.

367
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,519
Is it your first time at a dance party?

368
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,279
You'll know.

369
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,960
You have something
to tell me, don't you?

370
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,920
What are we doing here?

371
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,175
Let's dance and talk.

372
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,240
Can you dance?

373
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,359
Try me.

374
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,519
But I can't dance.

375
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,700
Let me teach you.

376
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,200
(Fang Yuke, don't be nervous.)

377
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,400
(Just tell her that you're Genius Yu.)

378
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,000
(Tell her everything about Genius Yu.)

379
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,960
I didn't know you could dance so well.

380
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,720
You'll see something more awesome.

381
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,640
Aren't you supposed to get to the point?

382
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,725
Do you really think
we're here to dance?

383
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,960
I'll start to explain
with the broadcasting studio accident

384
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,880
when we were in the second semester
of the first year in high school.

385
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,039
The broadcasting studio accident?

386
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,440
Wasn't it embarrassing enough?

387
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,599
To explain logically,

388
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,279
I must start with the first year...

389
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
When you were
in the first year of high school,

390
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,000
you'd already
started skateboarding, right?

391
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
That day, I saw you skateboard
very skillfully.

392
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,000
When I was very young...

393
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,240
Linlin learned that in the first week
of the summer holiday after junior high.

394
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,519
By the way, Linlin,

395
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,640
the other day, I read about you
on the trending topic of the Forum.

396
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,960
I recognized you at that time.

397
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,960
No wonder you knew my name.

398
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,759
I'll have a tennis match
in a couple of days.

399
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,640
I'll give you a free ticket.

400
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,400
Would you like to...

401
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,920
I...

402
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,839
Linlin isn't interested in tennis.

403
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,359
Don't worry. I'll make her interested.

404
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,599
Duanxi?

405
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,799
Zhou Linlin, good news.

406
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,519
I'm moving back to the dorm soon.

407
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,359
What does it have to do with me?

408
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,319
I'm doing that just because of you.

409
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,359
Me?

410
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,079
Change partners.

411
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,519
Ruting,

412
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,079
you misunderstood my relationship
with Duanxi.

413
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,050
I did?

414
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,700
Mm.

415
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,900
Where are you going?

416
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,400
It's quite noisy here.

417
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,559
Perhaps somewhere more private?

418
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,599
What better place to date
than at a party?

419
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm exhausted.

420
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,960
Not until this dance ends. Here you go.

421
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,240
Sorry,

422
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,319
but I'm not homosexual.

423
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,650
Do I look like I'm homosexual?

424
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,680
The boy for my friend must be out,
however perfect he is.

425
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,800
Change partners.

426
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,519
By the way,

427
00:24:59,079 --> 00:24:59,920
I have noticed

428
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,960
that you're a secret admirer of Linlin.

429
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,160
I am. So what?

430
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,920
How diffident you are!

431
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,359
Why are you afraid to tell her about it?

432
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,599
If I push it, she'll be annoyed.
And more haste, less speed.

433
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,240
The more you show off,
the faster you'll fail.

434
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:19,160
What are you talking about?

435
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,600
Wang Jie,

436
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,519
Ruting said she would move back
to the dorm.

437
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,850
What?

438
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,519
Back to the dorm?

439
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,640
But I put my things on her bed.

440
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,599
I'm done here.

441
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,599
I have to go back
and pack my things away.

442
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,359
Duanxi,

443
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,640
I'd like to ask you one last question.

444
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,400
If you no longer believe that,

445
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,119
does it still matter who Genius Yu is?

446
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,950
Linlin,

447
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,279
may I dance with you?

448
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,050
Fang Yuke!

449
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,559
Thank you for helping me out.

450
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:28,775
You sound so formal.

451
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,275
Do you hate me?

452
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,680
No.

453
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
Then do you like me?

454
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,119
No, either.

455
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,050

Yeah, and I'm your partner.

You dance smoothly

You're truly a master of skateboarding.

488

I would rather skateboard.

489
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,319
So much for our first dance.

490
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,000
Let's take a break and come back later.

491

499
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,599
What?

500
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,720
I'm not finished.

501
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,319
Continue, then.

502
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,119
Let's get out of here.

503
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,680
What on earth do you want to tell me?

504
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,599
I...

505
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,319
If you have nothing to say now,

506
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,350
let me say something.

507
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,960
Zhou Linlin, I fell in love with you
at second sight.

508
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,640
From this moment forward,

509
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,750
I'll start to pursue you.

511

(Little Theater of Unrequited love)

512
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,880
Why has Boss been behaving weirdly
since he got back from the party?

513
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,160
Yeah.

514
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,920
I've never seen him so serious.

515
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,960
Isn't this the young programmer?

516
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,275
What are you doing up this late?

517
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,359
Are you recalling tonight's party?

518
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,240
For what?

519
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,920
Your one-sided love for Linlin?

520
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,480
Whatever you say.

521
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,279
You don't even dare

522
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,400
to tell her that you like her.

523
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,480
I think nothing of you, exactly.

524
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,079
I know more about her than you'd think.

525
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,519
She will not accept you.

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,640
You don't decide if she accepts me.

527
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,640
Besides, how do you think
you can compete with me?

528
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,450
Who are you?

529
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,050
- What to compete for?
- You know what?

530
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,400
We're the strong support

531
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,240
for our boss.

532
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,559
How can you fight us three by yourself?

533
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,279
Good point.

534
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,975
Very good.

535
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,599
Numerical superiority, right?

536
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,279
Come out.

537
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,279
Let me introduce them.

538
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,160
They're my roommates,

539
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,125
Chen Chen and Lin Ze.

540
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,079
They're quite tall.

541
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:48,043
Mm.

542
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,725
I'm done introducing them.

543
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,200
We'll take our leave.

544
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,759
You and I will have
plenty of chances to meet, anyway.

545
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,400
Bye-bye, young programmer.

546
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,100
Go.

547
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,559
Oh my goodness.

548
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,680
Boss, they're bugs.

549
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,000
And they're rather tall.

550
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
When there are bugs in the program,
let's patch the bugs.

When there's a virus,
use the anti-virus software
