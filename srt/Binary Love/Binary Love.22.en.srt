come and join us.

172
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,750
I have time.

00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,625
I'll get back to work, then.

What are you watching?
You're so excited.

179

No... Nothing.

180
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,399
Just a poor tennis game.

181
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,100
Let me see it.

182
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,050
There's nothing to see.

Send it to me.

184

You'd better not see it.

185

I don't think so.

We just need that thing.

By the way,

don't be too greedy.

266
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,879
You should have at least
removed the price tag.

29.9 yuan.

What are they?

276

Shopping cards.

Buy anything you want with them.

may I have one?

I can use it when I'm engaged.

283
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:10,799
The cards are only valid for ten years.

284
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:11,846
When you're engaged,

285
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,425
they'll be invalid, I guess.

286

I'm upset.

This is Hanna, Linlin's colleague too.

You're Xiao Yi?

You know me?

294
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,440
What kind of wicked man

295
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,650
has called Zhou Linlin away?

296
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,400
A man who wrecks others' happiness

297
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,599
will not have true love, either.

298
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,325
You're cursing my boss, I think.

299

Yes, I am.

300

304

- I asked you, but you didn't tell me.
- Who knew?

305
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,039
Go open the door. Go.

306
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:32,759
Be right there.

307
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,640
Run. Run.

308
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,125
You don't need to run.

309
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,279
You're the last.

310
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
When you play together,

311
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,291
you're slower.

312
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,200
Mr. Xiao, Hanna.

313
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,225
Come in, please.

314
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,440
Why did you come with them?

315
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,700
I met them in the elevator.

316
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,900
My boss.

317
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,551
Did he come to make trouble?

318
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,959
Would he dare!

319
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,960
Calm down.

320
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,740
Let's see what he'll do.

321
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,759
Linlin, this is for you.

322
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,790
This is too precious.
I'd better not take it.

323
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,325
Mr. Xiao, there you are.

324
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,240
Welcome. And this is?

325
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,920
This is Hanna.

I've heard about you.

328
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,325
Linlin talks about you all the time.

329
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,251
It's a present from Mr. Xiao.

330
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,321
Linlin, you should accept it.

331
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:28,404
Band No. 000001.

332

It's for you.

333
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,359
This is your first design.

Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

336
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,375
Mr. Xiao, it's also your recognition

337
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,934
for Linlin's working ability.

338
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,559
All right. Don't just stand here.

339
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,675
- Wang Jie, take them to seats.

340
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,825
Linlin and I will prepare food for you.

Dinner will be ready soon.

342
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,341
What happened?

343
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,884
It doesn't seem like a perfect occasion

344
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,725
for a single man.

345
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,319
I'm single, too.

346
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,275
Let's sit together.

347
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,525
Here we go.

348
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,550
- Ruting, eat more. Have more mutton.
- Have some mutton.

349
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,225
Are you stopping me?

350
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,250
- Everybody.

351
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,359

to the engagement party
of Linlin and me.

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,039
Linlin and I have been through a lot.

354

Thank you for being our witnesses.

355
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,920
Thank you, guys.

356
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,119

What's this?

362
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,680
You'll reach a new chapter of your life.

363
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,725
This is the schedule I made for you.

364
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,599
I've even considered

365
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,440
when you'll have a baby.

366
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,039
Wang Jie.

367
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,119
Fang Yuke,

368

I think you'd better

369
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,559
have a baby of Virgo.

370
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,775
Stop. Thank you for your concern.

371
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,880
Enjoy the food. Eat more.

372
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,640
- What's the problem with Aries?
- Eat more.

373
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,600
I didn't know

374
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,820
you were so good at planning.

375
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,719
Detailed time planning

376
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,759
can increase the unit value of time.

377
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,675
Right?

378
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm also interested in time planning.

379
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,240
Hanna,

380
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,119
have Miss Wang
give some training on this

381
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,799
to our senior management.

382
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:41,975
Cheers.

383
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,680
Cheers.

384
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,000
Who's that?

385
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,250
I'll go open the door. You stay.

386
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,325
Be right there.

387
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:02,735
Wen Tao?

388
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:04,445
What brings you here?

389
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,440
Hi, Linlin.

390
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,454
What? Am I not welcome?

391
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:14,774
You're welcome, of course.

392
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:15,734
Come on in.

393
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,525
Did you tell Wen Tao?

394
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,575
I didn't, I swear.

395
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,450
I'll go get a chair for you.

396
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,460
Linlin,

397
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,175
I heard you would be engaged.

398
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,225
I have a present for you.

399
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,349
It's for you two.

400
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:40,395
Thanks.

00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:41,555
Unpack it and have a look.

402
00:22:41,555 --> 00:22:42,375
Thank you.

403
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,725
Let me see.

404
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,521
My final assignment of the Master Class?

405
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,400
(Don't let anything limit your talent.)
It even has Starck's signature.

406
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,200
(Starck)
Mm.

407
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:56,745
Do you like it?

408

Yes.

409
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,791
But how did you get my final assignment?

410
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,999
You came back to China
ahead of schedule, right?

411
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:05,199
Your classmate asked me
to take it back to you.

412
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,875
See? I didn't have time until today.

413
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Don't be too grateful.

414
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,519
Thanks.

415
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,400
Be seated and enjoy the hotpot.

416
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,920
Have some food.

417
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:21,214
Come on. Let's wish a happy engagement

418
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:22,565

Hanna.

427
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,720
Be careful. Be careful.

428
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,425
Don't help me.

429
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:49,050
- Nobody helps me.
- Watch your steps.

430
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,519
What's wrong with Wen Tao?

431
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,475
Who cares? Let's just hug.

432
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,475
Fang Yuke,

433

you must cherish

434
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,279
the present I gave you.

435
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,515
Otherwise, I would take it back
at any time.

436
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,320
Don't worry.

437
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,050
I will.

438
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,025

Hello. Will he come today?

504
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,126
After the Master Class,
sir never showed up.

505
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,976
You could be waiting for a month
or just forget it.

506
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,575
No. I must wait for him.

507
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,625
Why?

508
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
Because it's important for Linlin.

509
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,799
I really can't accept your love.

510
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,799
If you don't think we can

511
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,759
still be friends,

512
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,775
I understand that.

just like
you can't fall in love with me,

Mr. Starck?

524

At last, I've seen you.

525

No, two months.

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,125
It doesn't matter.

530
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,759
But Starck,

531
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,800
could you sign this for me?

532
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,670
I have a friend.

533
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,880
She adores you very much.

534
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Since little, she has had a dream.

535
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:15,026
If she can learn from you,
she'll be happy.

536
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,670
If you sign this for her,

537
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,460
she'll be happy, too.

538
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,871
When she's happy, I'm happy.

539
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,310
It's also very important for me.

By the way,

I didn't find it.

Oh.

You don't understand Chinese, right?

550
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,425

Aren't you supposed to be in China?

Let's get him back first.

Get up.

Come on. Let's go home.

570

Be careful. Be careful.

Go, go, go.

573
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,359
Don't ask for wine.

574
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,839
Be careful. Watch your steps.

575
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,650
Here's the water.

576
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,950
Get him up.

577
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,390
Have some water.

578
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,825
Get up.

579
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:23,075
Come on.

580
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,650
Here. Have some water.

581
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,000
Wine?

582
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,375
I'll drink it up.

583
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,531
It's too hot. Be careful.

584
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:41,975
I won't throw up.

585
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,850
Why is he so drunk?

586
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,420
It happens when people drink.

587
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,400
I'll stay and take care of him.

588
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,239
You go to sleep.

589
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:53,100
But you're also tired after the day.

590
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,575
I'm all right.

591
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,559
We have extra quilts.

592
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,875
Get one to me
and I'll sleep on the ground.

593
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,325
There isn't enough space on the ground.

594
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,920
Umm...

595
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,519
Why not share the bed with him?

596
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,200
You two shared one bed, anyway.

597
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,466
I'll go sleep in that room.
You get to bed early.

598
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,575
I'll leave the water here.

599
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,760
Don't go! Don't go!

600
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,599
I won't go. I won't.

601

Don't leave me alone.

Don't go.

Don't go.

Sign this for me.

I won't go. I won't.

606
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,320
I just won't.

Wipe your saliva.

So, tonight, there will be

a live interview in Xilin.

667
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,039
It helps with the advertising of bands.

Set out to the airport immediately.

669
