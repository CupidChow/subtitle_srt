170
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,720
I asked it for myself.

171
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,000
If you're still my friend,
tell me quickly.

172
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
Friend?

173
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,159
What?

174
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,759
Instead of sleeping
in the middle of the night,

175
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,879
you're here in the strong wind
after the infusion.

176
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,919
Do you or do you not want to recover?

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,960
What's wrong with you?

178
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,879
I'm caring about you, as a friend!

179
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,840
You're as good as new so quickly?

180
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,950
Mm.

181
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
My sadness is time-bound.

182
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,000
Sorry.

183
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,399
I failed to get the answer.

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,679
It doesn't matter.

185
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,919
He will fall in love with me.

186
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,399
You made sense.

187
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,600
I must know more about him.

188
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,960
I'm never a girl who easily gives up.

189
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,759
Thank you, anyway,

190
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,679
for asking Fang Yuke so late.

191
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,879
You're welcome. We're besties.

192
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,679
Now that we're besties,

193
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll share with you
my most precious thing.

194
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,039
Here.

195
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,200
What are you doing here?

196
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,720
Look how late it is now.

197
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,919
When did you start the relationship?

198
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,039
Why did you suddenly ask?

199
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,000
Answer my question!

200
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:06,519
Actually,

201
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,960
we're not in a relationship yet.

202
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,279
I just

203
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
had a crush on her.

204
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,279
And we kissed by surprise several times.

205
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,440
You kissed?

206
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,879
It's already late.

207
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,360
Don't yell at my door!

208
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,799
She kissed me first.

209
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,559
That's impossible.

210
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,679
At first, I also didn't believe it.

211
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,720
However...

212
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:50,919
She often visited me in the greenhouse.

213
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,960
Today, she even professed her love

214
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,000
and asked me to be her boyfriend.

215
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,039
In no way is this possible!

216
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,639
I rejected her.

217
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,879
How could you reject her?

218
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,879
We've known each other for only a month.

219
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,639
She doesn't know much about me yet.

220
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,240
Should I

221
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,960
say yes to her?

222
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't you dare!

223
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,960
What do you think I should do, then?

224
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,879
I don't care.

225
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,519
I just care about her.

226
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
Since when did you start
to care about Ruting?

227
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Don't interrupt.

228
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,799
We're talking about you and Zhou Linlin.

229
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,039
I have nothing to do with Zhou Linlin.

230
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,480
Wait, just to clarify.

231
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,600
Why do you care about Ruting?

232
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,200
I've never seen a girl

233
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,320
come so far after a boy.

234
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,000
It doesn't sound nice.

235
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,759
But I'm okay with it.

236
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,320
I'll pretend that you're praising me.

237
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,879
I am, of course.

238
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,519
You're the bravest girl I've ever seen.

239
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,600
When you love someone,

240
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,399
you must do something.

241
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
Only in this way

242
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,919
will he know how you feel for him.

243
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,879
But I never expected you to cry.

244
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,679
I thought you were very cool.

245
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,960
But you turned out to be ordinary.

246
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,759
I didn't cry.

247
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,759
You did.

248
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,360
Everyone here heard that just now.

249
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,960
I didn't cry.

250
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,360
I was watching a movie.

251
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,399
There was a loud cry in it.

252
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,039
Fine, then.

253
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,399
Don't tell anyone else

254
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,879
about the movie thing.

255
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,080
If you do,

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,879
I won't let you go.

257
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,720
I'll keep it secret.

258
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,600
Will you apply
all these things to your face?

259
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,960
Wrong.

260
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,879
We.

261
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,000
We will apply them to our faces.

262
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm tired already.

263
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,440
Do you think

264
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,840
I was born with such good skin?

265
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,559
Use skincare products
and you'll get good skin.

266
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,960
I'm telling you this
because you're my bestie.

267
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm too tired to do this.
I want to sleep.

268
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,159
Go wash your face.

269
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,039
Go, go, go.

270
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,799
Now that you care so much about her,

271
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,240
you should tell her.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
We haven't been so close yet.

273
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,840
Then when will you be?

274
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,919
We just started to be friends again.

275
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,440
I don't rush to profess to her
in case I scare her.

276
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,519
Linlin only treats me as a friend now.

277
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,159
Before you profess your love,

278
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,000
how can she know how you feel for her?

279
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,240
When Wen Tao appeared,

280
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,639
you defended her against him.

281
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,039
When you misunderstood her tonight,

282
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,000
you came to me.

283
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,799
Fang Yuke,

284
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,600
if you keep doing this,

285
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,000
can you really get her?

286
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,879
I've been loving her for years.

287
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,919
I want to take actual action

288
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,080
to make her grow fond of me.

289
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,200
I can wait.

290
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,840
What action have you taken?

291
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,720
You've missed too many opportunities.

292
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,519
Why not start now?

293
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,759
He took action so early?

294
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,559
Has he gone to buy breakfast for Linlin?

295
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,640
Breakfast shops can't be open
at this time of day.

296
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,400
Why did you get up so early?

297
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,480
For the sunrise, too?

298
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,160
Zhou Linlin,

299
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,599
I adore you.

300
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:13,920
Be careful! Be careful!

301
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,559
We came here by high-speed train.

302
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,000
But why do we have to return by coach?

303
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,759
Come on, it's the peak season.

304
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,079
Coach tickets are good enough.

305
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,200
Linlin,

306
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,799
I guess we have to wait for a while.

307
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,240
Are you thirsty?
Let me buy some water for you.

308
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,160
Don't bother.

309
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,319
Or we may miss the coach.

310
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,720
Well.

311
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,839
We want some water.

312
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,839
Linlin, wait for me.

313
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,799
I'm on it. I'll be right back.

314
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,319
Thank you.

315
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,200
Don't break my trunk.

316
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,440
Why did you kick it?

317
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,599
What?

318
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
What happened to you and Fang Yuke?

319
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
You were still
on speaking terms last night.

320
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,359
Why haven't you talked to him
since you got up this morning?

321
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,160
Did anything happen

322
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,759
when I was drunk?

323
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,400
No.

324
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,799
Nothing happened last night.

325
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,160
Last night, I was with Ruting.

326
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:21,440
Come on.

327
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:22,880
Don't talk about it here.

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is that true?

329
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:24,960
Linlin.

330
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:25,750
Zhu Li,

331
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,680
let's go.

332
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,599
Linlin,

333
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,920
this morning...

334
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,559
What happened this morning was

335
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,319

You bought a musang king.

You have no idea
how hard it is to crack a durian.
