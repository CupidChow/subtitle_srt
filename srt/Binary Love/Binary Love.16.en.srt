19
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,500
(February 2019)

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,599
Welcome to Paris.

21
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,519
That way.

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,360
Linlin, is it here?

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
(Are you tired?)

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,759
No, I'm okay.

25
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,080
It's only morning in Paris.

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,199
Is Wen Tao with you?

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,325
(He came with me.)

28
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,080
(I didn't just send Linlin here,)

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,775
(I'm also having dinner
with her tonight.)

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,479
Don't listen to him.

31
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,639
(He'll go back to his team later.)

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,199
If my mentor hadn't asked me
to stay and work on the project,

33
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,439
he wouldn't even have a chance
to carry your suitcase.

34
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,360
Fang Yuke says thank you.

35
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,280
I don't need him to thank me.

36
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm not doing this for him.

37
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,550
If he cares enough about you,

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,599
ask him to come in person.

39
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,375
Knock at the door.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,599
Okay.

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,050
Coming.

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,879
There you are.

43
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,439
Hello.

44
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,120
Come in.

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,879
Hello.

46
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,719
Come in.

47
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:57,925
Come in.

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,919
Well.

49
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,479
There are three girls living here.

50
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,840
A Moroccan girl, a Japanese girl,

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,650
and a Korean girl.

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,439
That room is yours.

53
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,080
Come in.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,225
Come in and have a look.

55
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,520
Hello.

56
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,719
Hello.

57
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,080
Hello.

58
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,280
Fang Yuke.

59
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,125
Look, it's the Eiffel Tower.

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,719
I wish I could be there with you.

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,425
Linlin.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,639
I'll take you to the Eiffel Tower

63
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,050
when you have time.

64
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
You can see the whole Paris up there.

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,319
Can you pay the rent first

66
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,240
before you two visit the tower?

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,925
I'll give it to you now.

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,800
You're not allowed to sublet the room.

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,479
The rent has to be paid every month.

70
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm living downstairs.

71
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
You can come to me if you need anything.

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,360
Okay.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,919
But only during working hours.

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,199
Here.

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,725
What does this mean, a tip?

76
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,199
Didn't we agree on

77
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,250
1,000 euros a month?

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,960
Hey, this is the price we set before.

79
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,100
The price has gone up.

80
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,300
2,000 euros.

81
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,800
Didn't we have a deal last week?

82
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,439
If you don't pay the rent today,

83
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,759
I'll raise the price to 2,500 next week.

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
(How can you raise the price
as you want?)

85
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,439
(You two have seen the house.)

86
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,920
(It's a great deal.)

87
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,319
(Even if you don't rent it,
a lot of people want to rent it.)

88
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,600
(Do you want to rent it or not?)

89
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,040
(Yes.)

90
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,959
(If we pay 2,000 euros now,)

91
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,040
(you won't raise the price again
this year, right?)

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,319
Okay.

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,250
I'll give you a discounted price
since you're also Chinese.

94
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,560
Wen Tao.

95
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,600
The price is way out of my budget.

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Let's find another house.

97
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,720
It's okay. Just stay here.

98
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,125
I think it's a nice house.

99
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,240
It's also close to your school.

100
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,439
Don't worry about the rent.

101
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,279
I'll pay for it.

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,399
(Linlin.)

103
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,480
(I just found)

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,839
(the rental information
of this house on the Internet.)

105
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,240
(The registration information shows)

106
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,439
that the landlord
of this house is French.

107
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:06,279
Aunt.

108
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,700
Let my boyfriend finish first.

(and he replied)

113
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,850
(that the rent is 1,000 euros a month.)

114
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,675
Aunt, do you hear it?

115
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,759
I'm an agent.

116
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,279
Shouldn't I charge you

117
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,319
an agent's fee?

118
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Isn't it a little unreasonable

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,639
of you to raise the price
from 1,000 to 2,000?

120
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,000
We will negotiate the price
with the landlord

121
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,519
and transfer the agent's fee to you.

122
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,560
Do you have any more questions?

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,040
You're pretty good.

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,439
You have another boyfriend back home.

125
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,279
You can leave now.

126
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,879
How did Fang Yuke find the landlord?

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,639
(It's not hard,)

128
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,720
(as long as you can use a computer.)

129
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,040
Why haven't you hung up yet?

130

Thanks to you,

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,800
or I'd have been cheated
on my first day in France.

Don't worry.

133
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,079
I'll always be there.

134
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,839
Be sure to tell me if anything happens.

135

To help you clean up.

00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,319
No need.

143
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,680
You've also had a long day.

Just go back.

145
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,519
Don't miss your training.

146
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,450
It's okay. I have time.

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,120
I'm a little tired, too.

148
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,360
I want to have some rest.

149
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,439
You should leave.

150
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,759
All right.

151
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,319
Well, I'll come back
after you rest well.

152
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,920
Oh, I forgot to say goodbye.

153
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,800
Bye-bye, Linlin.

154

Bye-bye.

155
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,800
Hey.

156
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm living on my own now.

157
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,875
Look.

158
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,160
Your boyfriend in China

159
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,879
has to get used to being
in a long-distance relationship.

160
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,650
I regret it already.

161
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,279
Why?

162
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,240
(I regret not packing you
in my suitcase)

(Or I wouldn't miss you
so much right now.)

I don't have time this week, either.

Why do you always
go to the Botanical Garden?

the Botanical Garden
is a perfect place for dating.

I carefully selected it.

You see, you can take beautiful pictures

that can create countless topics

for you and your date.

240
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,159
The most important thing is

241
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,639
that the ticket is only 10 yuan.

242
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,039
It will only cost you 50 yuan
for going there five times.

243

Hold on.

244
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,240
Do you buy your own ticket on a date?

245
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,720
It's not important.

246

Right, Ruting?

You're finally done talking.

Fortunately, it's in the early stage.

290
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,675
Otherwise, the infected leaves
will spread

and seriously affect
the growth of the plants.

I didn't expect I will

compete with a leaf
for my boyfriend one day.

I'm sorry, Ruting.

295
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,100
I'll take pictures of you right now.

296
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,799
I really like roses.

297
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,461
It's not just any rose.

298
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,360
It's a Chinese rose.

299
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,250
Are you sure you want to argue with me?

300

I'm not arguing with you.

301
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm trying to tell you

302
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,919
that roses and Chinese roses

303
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,480
both belong to the rose family,

304
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
but there are still differences.

305
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,200
Roses are small with little thorns.

306
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,279
Chinese roses are big with big thorns.

307
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,879
And they have
different flowering phases.

308
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,025
I just like roses.

309
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,150
It's about my feelings.

310
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,350
But the type of roses
has nothing to do with your feelings.

311
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:51,325
Yeah.

312
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,839
Jesus!

313
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,440
What is it that you can't tell me
over the phone

314
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,359
and you have to tell me in person?

315
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,480
Your line is only for Zhou Linlin now.

316
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:16,839
I couldn't reach you.

317
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,160
Go ahead.

318
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,839
What's the matter?

319
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,240
I made Ruting angry.

320
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,559
What's wrong with you?

321
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,480
Why are you so angry?

322
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,440
Ruting, have you eaten yet?

323
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,559
Obviously, she is full of anger now.

324
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,319
I asked him to take pictures of me,

325
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,559
but he went to talk
to the staff about rust disease.

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,359
I told him I liked roses.

327
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,759
He told me it was a Chinese rose.

328
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,920
I talked about feelings,

329
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,175
but he talked about academics.

330
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,000
I can't believe I had to
compete with a leaf for my boyfriend!

You gave me a lot of advice

Why do you become a fool

Fang Yuke is treating the symptoms

Besides, he can't help you now.

It's a piece of cake.

I can take care of it in a second.

Don't worry.

When I was a child,

I repaired all the water

It didn't rain today.

499
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,680
He went to Zhou Linlin's house

500
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,720
and changed his clothes.

501
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,800
Do you mean Tao took a shower
at Zhou Linlin's house?

502
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,300
What are you talking about?

503
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,400
Nothing, Tao.

504
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,275
How are you two going?

505
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,925
What do you mean?

506
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,775
We've been marching on the spot.

507
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:20,839
No way.

508
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,839
You carried all those bags to see her.

509
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,525
She is alone in France.

510
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,119
You two must have...

511
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,400
Don't take wild guesses.

512
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,550
She had a burst pipe.

513
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,350
A pipe burst means...

514
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,519
You came out of nowhere,

515
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,000
stopped the water

516
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,640
and fixed the pipe.

517
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,100
- Then you two...
- Stop it.

518
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,770
I broke her pipe

519
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,025
and the water spattered all over us.

520
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,440
Fang Yuke found someone to fix it.

521
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,119
Well, it's okay.

522
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:44,839
I think

523
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,599
the most important thing is

524
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,720
you were there for her.

525
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:48,799
Right.

526
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:50,800
Yeah.

527
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,225
I think you have a point.

528
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:53,825
Yes.

529
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:54,579
Yes.

530
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,700
Yes.

531
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,846
Very well.

532
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,846
Good atmosphere.

533
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,800
Linlin.

534
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,839
Wen Tao.

535
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,240
Why are you here again?

536
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,000
I have nothing to do today.

537
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,839
I'll take you out.

538
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,359
Aren't you here for the contest?

539
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,319
Don't you have training?

540
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,920
I have my own plans for the team.

541
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,839
Don't worry about it.

542
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's go.

543
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,525
Is he your boyfriend?

544
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,599
Yes.

545
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,119
No, no.

546
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
See you later.

547
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:28,784
See you later.

548
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,839
She asked me if you are my boyfriend.

549
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,720
Don't answer
when you don't understand the question.

550
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,319
That's what she asked?

551
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,000
I can only say

552
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,200
"yes", "hello", "thank you"
and "I'm sorry" in French.

553
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,680
And also, "where is the toilet"?

554
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,799
You should improve your French.

555
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,400
Otherwise, people will
get you wrong easily.

556
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,525
Yes.

557

(Send the photo to Zhou Linlin)

558
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,075
Wen Tao is a little shameless.

Boss, look.

560
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,400

It can't be tolerated!

564

It can't be tolerated at all!

565

Come on, boss.

566
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,559
Say something.

567
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
What else can he say?

568
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,599
Someone else
is taking care of his girlfriend.

569
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,400
If you were him, could you
think of anything to say?

570
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,680
Just shut up
if you don't know the art of speaking.

571
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,200
You...

572

You stumbler.

573
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,440
Boss, say something.

574
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,039
Let's finish the project
as soon as possible.

575
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,519
Then I'll go to France to see her.

576
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,839
I'm back.

577
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:45,960
You're back

578
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,799
Hello.

579
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,759
Linlin, have some rest over there.

580
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,880
I'll take care of this.

581
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,400
You flooded my house last time.

582
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
You're not gonna set my house
on fire this time, are you?

583
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,240
It was an accident last time.

You have to trust me.

I'll do it with you.

There are so many foods.

Pasta.

Are you gonna take them all out?

Yeah.

595
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,400
They will go bad in the bags.
Leftover food is unhealthy.

Celery,
