340
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,319
Didn't you say you were just friends

341
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,440
the last time I saw you on the roof?

342
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,525
Friends cleared the misunderstanding

343
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,400
and became boyfriend and girlfriend.

344
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,440
Thank you, sir.

345
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,599
You boy.

346
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,400
You haven't come back
to visit us for so long.

347
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,160
Come on.

348
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,759
Not many students

349
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,279
can go to Southern University,

350
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:33,950
right?

351
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,160
Come and catch up with me.

352
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,025
Let's go.

353
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,640
Happy New Year.

354
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,675
It's your first time
to spend the New Year with me.

355
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,400
Are you not getting down from me?

356
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,640
Let me help you.

357
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,920
No, I can do it.

358
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,880
What's wrong?

359
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,725
My hair can't get hurt
for even a little bit.

360
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,319
Why is it raining so heavily out here?

361
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
Dad, Mom.

362
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,240
Didn't you go to Sanya?

363
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,599
The flight was canceled
due to bad weather.

364
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,920
Yeah, the whole trip has been delayed.

365
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,200
Uncle. Aunt.

366
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,160
Uncle. Aunt.

367
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,240
Happy New Year.

368
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,200
Happy New Year.

369
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:31,925
Who is this?

370
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,960
Uncles. Aunts. Happy New Year.

371
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,000
I haven't had a chance
to introduce myself.

372
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,359
My name is Xie Duanxi.

373
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,400
You can call me Xi.

374
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,680
Xi at Home.

375
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,200
It's a popular app lately

376
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,359
for cooking at your home.

377
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Cooking.

378
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,125
Wait a minute.

379
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,119
Dinner will be ready soon.

380
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,625
What were you going to say?

381
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,160
I was gonna tell them

382
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,150
that I'm your boyfriend.

383
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,799
Really?

384
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,319
I'm so glad you think in this way,

385
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,925
but it's not a good time now.

386
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,160
I need to give my dad a heads-up first.

387
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,500
When can I tell them then?

388
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,350
The next time when I kiss you.

389
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,359
Then it's now.

390
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,275
When will we have dinner?

391
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,350
Soon!

392
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,450
I can cook.

393
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,640
We're having a nice dinner tonight.

394
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,321
Yeah.

395
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,759
It looks good.

396
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:20,880
- This dish...
- Uncle. Aunt.

397
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,200
Take your time to enjoy the meal.

398
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,039
I'll leave first.

399
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,880
Hold on.

400
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,359
Sit down.

401
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,759
Let's eat together.

402
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,119
Just sit down as you're told to.

403
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,480
Which university do you study at?

404
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,240
Southern University.

405
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,599
Are you Ruting's boyfriend?

406
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,880
Let's eat.

407
00:28:58,725 --> 00:28:59,519
Come on.

408
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,025
Mm.

409
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,375
You cooked well.

410
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,700
Thank you, Uncle.

411
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,125
He's my boyfriend.

412
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:15,960
Ruting.

413
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,225
Why didn't you admit that?

414
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,200
I told him not to say anything.

415
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,640
I'm not ready to tell you yet.

416
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,000
Ruting has been spoiled since childhood.

417
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,039
She is a curious girl.

418
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,200
She changes her hobbies

419
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,119
every day.

420
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,720
However,

421
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
in short,

422
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:41,799
she is still a child.

423
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,480
Her feelings for you

424
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,640
come fast and go fast.

425
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,279
Uncle.

426
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,275
This Ruting you're talking about

427
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,225
is not the same Ruting as I know.

428
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,300
In my eyes,

429
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,480
Ruting is a determined person.

430
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,799
As long as she knows what she wants,

431
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,440
no matter how hard it is,

432
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,200
she will try everything

433
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,480
to make it happen.

434
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,079
I used to be a person

435
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,675
who didn't know

436
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,559
how to communicate emotionally
with other people.

437
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,960
Until I met Ruting.

438
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,359
She changed me.

439
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,400
She taught me.

440
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,625
She showed me

441
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,559
the right way to express love.

442
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,225
I'm truly grateful

443
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,600
that Ruting showed up in my life.

444
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,650
I'm serious about Ruting.

445
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,960
I'm sure Ruting is
also serious about me.

446
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,750
Let her speak.

447
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,960
Dad.

448
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,279
You're right.

449
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,275
I used to be

450
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,000
a curious child.

451
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,375
I took everything I had

452
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,960
for granted.

453
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
You and Mom

454
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,279
gave me a lot of care
and encouragement.

455
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,079
But,

456
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,519
I think I never realized

457
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,125
that I should be grateful

458
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,240
for all of this.

459
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,075
Now I've grown up.

460
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,039
Xie Duanxi taught me

461
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,440
that love is something
you should make efforts to get.

462
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,875
It's about perseverance,

463
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,325
about going all out.

464
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,400
You have to pay something
to get something.

465
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:58,880
Therefore,

466
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,575
Xie Duanxi

467
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,350
is serious about me.

468
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,575
I'm also serious

469
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,640
about Xie Duanxi.

470
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,960
Please trust me this time.

471
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,900
I think this dish tastes good.

472
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,200
What do you think?

473
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,039
It's good.

474
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,759
Come on. Let's eat.

475
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Eat more.

476
00:32:58,325 --> 00:32:59,025
Come on.

477
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,200
It's a pity

478
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,675
today.

479
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,119
We weren't supposed to eat here today.

480
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,599
Yeah.

481
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,920
We were supposed to eat on the beach.
