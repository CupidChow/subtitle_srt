00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,279
Or,

171
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,279
shall I rent a bus for you?

172
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,440
You'll be the only passenger.

173
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,360
Just enjoy the noodles.

174
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,759
Have a taste.

175
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:16,000
Mm.

176
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,960
How do they taste?

177
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,000
Better

178
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,200
than what you cooked last time.

179
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,320
A lot better?

180
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,625
Mm.

181
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,440
Linlin, you can cook

182
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,279
much better food now.

183
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,919
Fang Yuke cooked the noodles.

184
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,320
He came?

185
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:41,125
Mm.

186
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,120
Wen Tao,

187
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,000
long time no see.

188
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,519
Yeah.

189
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,919
It's been so long.

190
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,000
You have classes this afternoon, right?

191
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,250
Go to the classes.

192
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,120
Leave him to me.

193
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,559
I'll come after school, then.

194
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,925
Does your wound still hurt?

195
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,600
Not very much.

196
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
Thank you

197
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,080
for saving Linlin.

198
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,399
You don't have to thank me.

199
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,600
I saved Linlin

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,879
because I wanted to.

201
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,279
As long as she's safe,

202
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,799
I'm okay with everything.

203
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,279
I know.

204
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,799
But I still want to thank you.

205
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
So, I'll take good care of you

206
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,320
on behalf of Linlin.

207
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,559
You don't like the noodles?

208
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,679
I can buy something else for you.

209
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,159
You... You...

210
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,759
What are you up to?

211
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,480
Wait here for me.

212
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,559
I'll be right back.

213
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,720
The soup of this restaurant is
very famous.

214
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,640
I walked a long way
to buy some for you.

215
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,039
It has exactly the same taste

216
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,319
as that of our homeland.

217
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,440
Try it.

218
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,480
I don't want it.

219
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:27,720
Here's a mandarin.

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
Let me peel it for you.

221
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,079
Don't... Don't do this.

222
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,039
You make me scared.

223
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,279
Why are you being so nice to me?

224
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,599
Did you...?

225
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,559
Did you poison the mandarin?

226
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:41,600
What?

227
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,440
So sweet.

228
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,400
You have to taste some.

229
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,240
A mandarin has many segments.

230
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,359
Who knows which one you poisoned?

231
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,079
I won't eat it.

232
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,960
What are you doing?

233
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,750
Putting away the dinnerware.

234
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,000
I thought you were going to kill me.

235
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,240
Linlin, thank God you're here.

236
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,240
Why are your lips so dry?

237
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,240
Did you not have any water?

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,079
Fang Yuke said you didn't have
the dinner he bought you.

239
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,359
What happened?

240
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:52,920
Linlin,

241
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,160
could you stay and take care of me?

242
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,880
Why?

243
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,000
Did Fang Yuke do a poor job?

244
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,799
I think he wants to torture me.

245
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,279
Torture you?

246
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,559
How?

247
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,480
Think about it.

248
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,880
He's a very smart guy

249
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,480
so he can do smart crimes.

250
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,480
If he puts laxatives in my meals,

251
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,440
I will not know.

252
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:15,960
There are no laxatives in the water.

253
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,119
Have some water first.

254
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't overthink it.

255
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,920
When Fang Yuke broke his arm,

256
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,000
you took care of him, too.

257
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,480
You meant good, right?

258
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,079
It... It makes me more scared.

259
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:33,225
Ah?

260
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,279
What are you doing?

261
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm... I'm not thirsty.

262
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,525
Have dinner now.

263
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,000
Come out with me.

264
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,960
Tonight, I'll stay to keep him company.

265
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,920
You should go back home early.

266
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,079
I have something to ask you.

267
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,525
Ask, then.

268
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,920
Why are you suddenly
being so nice to Wen Tao?

269
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,079
If he hadn't protected you,

270
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
you would have been hurt.

271
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,359
So, I'm really grateful to him

272
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,759
for stepping out and saving you
when you were in danger.

273
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,200
To express my gratitude,

274
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,119
before he recovers,

275
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,279
I will look after him very well.

276
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,240
Fang Yuke,

277
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,359
thank you.

278
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,680
Little fool,

279
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,559
don't say thank you to your boyfriend.

280
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,279
But the biggest problem is

281
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,759
that no matter what I do,

282
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,519
he thinks I want to hurt him.

283
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,799
You've taken care of him the whole day.

284
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,160
You're still suffering from the jet leg.

285
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,759
Leave him to me tonight.

286
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,039
Don't worry.

287
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,079
I'll tell him how grateful you are.

288
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,079
Take good care of yourself, too.

289
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,400
Mm.

290
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,275
(Half a month later)

291
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,900
(Necker Children's Hospital)

292
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:56,615
Ouch.

293
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,039
Feeling any better yet?

294
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,599
Why is it you again?

295
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:04,960
Where's Linlin?

296
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,880
She has classes.

297
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,680
From today on,

298
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,920
I'll take care of you

299
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,000
every day

300
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,559
until you recover
and leave the hospital.

301
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,640
Rest assured.

302
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,839
I'll take good care of you

303
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,880
on behalf of Linlin.

304
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,200
Have a good rest

305
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,359
and grow fresh.

306
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,680
When you're energetic,

307
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,119
you'll recover sooner.

308
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,240
When are you going back to China?

309
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,200
Not in a hurry.

310
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,200
I told our school about what happened.

311
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,559
They showed great understanding.

312
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:37,839
So, I can go back to China

313
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,200
after you have a full recovery.

314
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,519
Never mind.

315
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,319
If you don't want me
to take care of you,

316
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,039
I can have someone else do it.

317
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,720
Are you sure?

318
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,039
Wait.

319
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:00,839
Hello.

320
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,119
- Hello.
- Hello.

321
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,880
So, he's someone else?

322
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,750
Mm.

323
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,279
He's a caregiver at this hospital.

324
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
He's very professional and experienced.

325
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,000
Most importantly,

326
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,039
he looked after athletes before.

327
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,160
Don't trouble him.

328
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:21,960
No, thanks.

329
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,599
But...

330
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,039
Are you sure?

331
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:25,920
Sorry.

332
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,839
I don't need him.

333
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,640
Sorry.

334
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,599
Sorry.

335
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,960
Goodbye.

336
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,039
Why did you make a fool of me?

337
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,839
Have lunch first. Let me get it for you.

338
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,759
All right, all right.

339
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,920
Don't bother.

340
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,160
Would you like some water?

341
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,480
Do you want to go to the toilet?

342
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,039
Wen Tao,

343
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,200
let me know if you need anything.

344
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,319
I'll do my best to help you.

345
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,079
I just want to rest, okay?

346
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:55,759
No problem.

347
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,039
Let me make the bed for you.

348
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,119
I can do it myself.

349
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,960
Let me do it myself.

350
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,599
- Let me help.
- Please.

351
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,400
I'll do it myself.

352
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,440
- Here I am.
- Don't bother.

353
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,325
I can do it myself.

354
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,559
You're getting close so quickly.

355
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,519
Linlin,

356
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,225
don't get us wrong.

357
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,400
Fang Yuke...

358
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,799
What? Is he not nice to you?

359
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,559
He's being so nice to me

360
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,400
that I can't bear it.

361
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Then let him take care of you
a bit longer.

362
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:21,960
I just feel

363
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,359
I've fully recovered.

364
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:24,880
I can be discharged.

365
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,599
Let me show you.

366
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,160
Don't move.

367
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,279
Lie down.

368
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,000
As the saying goes, you need 100 days
to recover from a bone injury.

369
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,375
It's been only half a month.

370
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,279
You're an athlete.

371
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,920
You must be very careful,

372
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,519
or your career will be affected.

373
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,400
But I really don't want...

374
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,359
Isn't it too early for Wen Tao

375
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,319
to leave hospital now?

376
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,160
He's all right, I'm sure.

377
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,640
We just had him

378
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,039
take a full body check, right?

379
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,519
His physical condition

380
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,960
is even better than mine.

381
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
Thank you, Fang Yuke.

382
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,240
Without you,

383
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,720
I wouldn't know what to do.

384
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,640
I have to leave soon.

385
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,225
Mm.

386
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,400
You've stayed here for days.

387
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,119
Prof. Chen must have rushed you.

388
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,960
Sorry.

389
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:50,240
We have to be separated again.

390
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,039
Get up and make dinner.

391
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,799
Hurry.

392
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,279
I'm on it.

393
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,640
Are you a supervisor?

394
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,599
I'm not.

395
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:38,839
Can't you see how hungry I am?

396
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,799
Go make a call to Wen Tao

397
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,319
and see if he's back in his dorm.

398
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,480
Our dinner

399
00:26:46,025 --> 00:26:46,880
will be ready soon.

400
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:47,625
Mm.

401
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,920
Hello, Linlin.

402
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,759
Hello, Wen Tao.

403
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,640
Are you back in your dorm?

404
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,079
I'm on the training ground.

405
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,599
Training?

406
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,279
Aren't you supposed to rest?

407
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,559
I just can't.

408
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,279
Because I'm a genius tennis player

409
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,039
and my team counts on me.

410
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,160
With great power comes
great responsibility.

411
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,480
Looks like you've really recovered.

412
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,960
Linlin, I'm asked to do the training.

413
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,079
I can't talk anymore.

414
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,200
I'll hang up.

415
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,480
Okay. Bye-bye.

416
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,680
Mm.

417
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,425
It tastes great.

418
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,240
Why only one plate?

419
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:02,799
When we share one plate,

420
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,960
we only need to wash one.

421
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:08,599
You really know how to do less work.

422
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,440
Here.

423
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,200
I will

424
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,359
definitely buy a dishwasher in our home.

425
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:14,839
We've got one.

426
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,559
You're the dishwasher.

427
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,079
Tao.

428
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,799
Be careful.

429
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,240
Tao,

430
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,359
you just recovered.

431
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,640
And you're doing
such intensive training.

432
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,279
Is it okay?

433
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Cut the crap, will you?

434
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,519
I've recovered.

435
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Have you had enough rest?

436
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,000
If you do, start the training.

437
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,799
Tao, don't be sad.

438
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,839
Fang Yuke came, so what?

439
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,599
Let's think of another way.

440
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,680
Yeah. A leading actor like you
will turn the tide.

441
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,559
You know what?

442
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:51,200
I thought I had done enough for her.

443
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,079
Every day I kept Linlin company

444
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,920
and picked her up from school.

445
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,799
I wanted to give her everything.

446
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,599
But since Fang Yuke came,

447
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,519
Linlin has been the happiest

448
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,519
that I've ever seen all this time.

449
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,325
I finally understand now.

450
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,000
Maybe Linlin

451
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,559
has never meant to rely on me.

452
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,559
Tao...

453
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,319
It's okay.

454
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,559
Anyway, as long as Linlin is happy,

455
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,799
I'm happy, too.

456
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:24,319
Let's get started.

457
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,725
Tao,

458
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,400
- we'll be with you.
- We'll be with you.

459
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,640
Come on.

460
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,359
Go.

461
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,240
I don't want you to leave.

462
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,200
Then shall I put you in my trunk

463
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,759
and take you back to China?

464
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,559
I'll see you soon, anyway.

465
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:07,680
When we meet again,

466
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,559
we will never part.

467
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,960
I promise you.

468
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,839
We will meet soon again.

469
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,920
All right.

470
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,440
Off you go.

471
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,599
I'll sleep for a while.

472
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,119
Tell me when you arrive at the airport.

473
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,720
I'm leaving, then.

474
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:03,475
Mm.

475
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,050
You...

476
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,680
Take good care of yourself.

477
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,575
Hey.

478
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,359
Are you okay?

479
00:31:56,675 --> 00:31:57,839
I'm okay. Thank you.

480
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,350
Well,

481
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,600
today, we should do a small exercise

482
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,525
- (Have you reached the airport?)
- to understand the structure of the human body.

483
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:14,960
So, I brought a model

484
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,319
for you today.

485
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,799
Lin, he says that he is
your boyfriend, right?

486
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,079
And he volunteered
to be our model today.

487
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,039
Do you agree?

488
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,839
Yes, my pleasure.

489
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,600
Good.

490
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,039
What should I do?

491
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,160
You just stand here.

492
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,079
All right.

493
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,319
You can start drawing.

494
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,640
Thank you.

495
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,559
(How is your class?)

496
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,720
(Here's a handsome male model.)

497
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,519
(Take the class seriously, then.)

498
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,760
I didn't know
you were a part-time model here.

499
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,239
Do you like my part-time job?

500
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,250
Mm.

501
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,760
Can you come every day?

502
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:25,825
Yes, if you want it.

503
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,440
If you return to China late,

504
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,239
what about your project?

505
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:32,719
I applied to Prof. Chen

506
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,760
for staying with you for a bit longer.

507
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,079
I can do my work online,

508
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,800
as long as I'm not behind schedule.

509
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
During this period,

510
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,960
you must be
my exclusive model every day.

511
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,599
No problem.

512
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,000
But...

513
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,639
How will you reward me?

514
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,639
We're in the classroom.

515
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,880
I'm back!

516
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,039
(Welcome Zhou Linlin back in triumph)
Welcome back!

517
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,000
Long time no see.

518
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,039
We missed you so much.

519
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,199
What are you waiting for?

520
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,480
Fine, then.

521
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,850
I missed you!

522
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,000
I missed you!

523
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,360
Don't you expect your return present?

524
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,400
A present for me?

525
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,159
Exactly.

526
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:44,960
I bought the ribbon flower.

527
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,320
I bought the wrapping paper.

528
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,800
The digital plate

529
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,239
was bought by Ruting.

530
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,400
Let me check it out.

531
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,599
I love this type.

532
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,039
It's quite responsive to pressure.

533
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,480
Yes, it is. Would you like to try it?

534
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,480
Go, go, go.

535
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,325
- Let me have a look.
- Go.

536
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,400
- Welcome. Warmly welcome.
- Welcome. Warmly welcome.

537
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,440
(Boss, welcome back.)
Welcome. Warmly welcome.

538
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,280
What a low program!

539
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Don't show it to me anymore.

540
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,679
As the saying goes,

541
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,159
- it's the thought...
- That counts.

542
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,519
Under the pressure

543
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,800
of the projects and classes,

544
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
we found some time

545
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,225
to prepare this surprise for you.

546
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:33,850
Mm.

547
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,400
Thanks, but don't do it again.

548
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,440
What happened to Boss?

549
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,559
Did he have a love problem in Paris?

550
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,800
I have no idea.

551
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,800
I guess...

552
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Presents for you.

553
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,119
What is this?

554
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,079
Oh my goodness.

555
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,199
The latest game. But...

556
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,000
I don't think I deserve this.

557
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,960
I'm not involved in your project.

558
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,320
I...

559
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,199
Boss, I don't deserve this, too.

560
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,599
I can't

561
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,559
do your part.

562
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,039
I'm just waiting for your return.

563
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,559
Give it back to me, then.

564
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,519
No way.

565
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,320
Give it back to me.

566
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,000
No, no.

567
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,079
You gave them to us.

568
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,320
You can in no way take them back.

569
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,360
I won't give it back to you.

570
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,559
So, for Fang Yuke,

571
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,239
you quit Starck Master Class
ahead of time?

572
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,400
Is it time to care about Starck now?

573
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,199
But...

574
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:28,760
Boss,

575
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,199
did you and your girl

576
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
have any special experiences?

577
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,280
I took care of Wen Tao.

578
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,599
Does that count?

579
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,320
Didn't you ever have sex?

580
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,960
No.

581
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,599
I'm still a virgin.

582
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,159
You stayed together for so many nights

583
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,400
and nothing happened?

584
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,639
Boss, is it that you were exhausted

585
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,519
after a long flight
and busy work with the project?

586
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,679
In my opinion,

587
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,559
you should push the envelope.

588
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,079
Come on, what's on your mind?

589
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,440
Now, I should study hard,

590
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,119
instead of getting lost in romance.

591
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,800
If you have plenty of time,
review your lessons.

592
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,360
Under the pressure
of the project and schoolwork,

593
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,119
I have to squeeze in my relationship.

594
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,159
Well, of course, I can

595
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,719
also study hard as I enjoy sweet love.

596
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,039
I can't bear it. I should go.

597
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,000
Where are you going?

598
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,119
Home.

599
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,679
Will you not date Xie Duanxi?

600
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,480
We are dating at every moment.

601
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,810
Disgusting.

602
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,000
(Which is prettier, the flower or me?)

603
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,719
You.

604
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,360
That sounds perfunctory.

605
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,800
(Both.)

606
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,159
Wrong.

607
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,679
(However pretty the flower is,)

608
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,159
(your smile looks more charming.)

609
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:08,300
This answer

610
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,599
sounds better.

611
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:12,639
I worry

612
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,239
that even after I graduate from school,

613
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I can't graduate from your world.

614
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
(You want to leave my world?)

615
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,400
No, no.

616
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,039
For you,

617
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,350
I'll stay here forever.

618
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,175
Mm.

619
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,199
You're getting more honey-lipped.

620
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,880
The winter vacation is coming.

621
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,119
When are you going back home?

622
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,599
(I still need some data for my paper.)

623
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,599
(I have to stay
and observe the experiment.)

624
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,559
(I don't think I can go home
for winter vacation.)

625
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,159
You can come to my home
and keep me company.

626
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,119
Do your parents miss the dishes I cook?

627
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
(As soon as I'm done with work,)

628
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,000
(I'll visit you in the first place.)

629
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,960
(Don't keep me waiting for too long.)

630

(January 21, 2020)

(Linlin, what are you doing?)

632
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,159
Hello, Mom. I'm packing my luggage.

633
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll go back with Fang Yuke later.

634

In my opinion,

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,559
don't bother to come back home.

644
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,639
Stay where you are
for the Spring Festival.

645

Don't you worry about us?

646
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,125
Everyone else is rushing home.

Let Yuke know about this.

650
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,679
I told his mother

651

to stop him from coming back.

652
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,000
He has gone to buy masks.

how high masks are in demand now.
