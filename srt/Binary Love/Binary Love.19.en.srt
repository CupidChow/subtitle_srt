00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,519
6,000.

171
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,800
Is 8,000 after taxes okay for you?

172
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
8,000?

173
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,439
There is no need to talk about salary.

174
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,720
The upper limit for graduates is 6,000.

175
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,839
After-tax?

176
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,650
Before-tax.

177
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,079
All right, you can leave now.

178
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,000
As a designer,

179
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,920
I think the design drawing

180
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,199
is the most accurate way to show
my understanding of these styles.

181
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,000
I drew a sketch.

182
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,800
Please take a look.

183
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,439
God help me pass it.

184
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,279
Why do you have coffee?

185
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
The HR gave it to me when I went in.

186
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,879
Didn't you get any?

187
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,240
I didn't even get cold water.

188
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:39,759

Who should we choose
between these two girls?

190
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,799
Keep them both.

191
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,080
It's a probation period anyway.

192
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,720
Hanna.

193
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,480
Was your evaluation of Zhou Linlin

194
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,759
a little too simple?

195
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,039
However,

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
she sketched out

197
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,480
designs in three styles really fast.

198
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,360
She has steady hands,
and the quality is okay.

199
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,440
She worked with Mr. Xiao before.

200
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,039
What's more,

201
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,240
she also attended Starck Master Class.

But I don't know
what the result will be.

229
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,360
A truly good designer

230
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,720
doesn't need to be evaluated

231
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,039
by the rules and regulations
in an interview.

232
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,399
I think

233
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,440
you can make it.

234
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,519
It's been three years.

235
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,919
Is your ideal

236
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,440
still the same?

237
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,840
It's more specific than before.

238
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,919
I got quarantined for half a month

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
because of the epidemic.

240
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,360
When I saw those volunteers

241
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,320
spend a lot of time

242
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
on disinfection every day,

243
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,080
I was thinking what exactly
industrial design is.

244
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,120
It's about designing things

245
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,440
that can help people
solve their problems in life.

246
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,279
That's what I'm thinking right now.

00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,519

248

00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:08,840
- Why did you come?
- Sorry. Sorry.

Mr. Xiao, the owner of MMP bar?

255

I remember seeing you
when I was a freshman.

Not a big deal. You're welcome.

Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

260
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,720
I ran into him on my way
to the interview today.

261
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,720
What a coincidence.

262
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,975
It's like a novel.

263
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Then it must be a horror novel.

He's been stalking you for three years

265
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,080
and now he's finally making a move.

266
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,759
Don't be ridiculous.

267
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,519
He might be my client one day.

268

the first thing I will do
is to work with BQ.

We can also lower the price.

I'll have a midnight snack now.

501
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,880
I'll get fat!

502
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,079
If no one wants me, just let it be!

503
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,559
She completely lost her mind.

504
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,119
Why is she more dramatic
than usual today?

505
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,440
I guess it's graduation syndrome.

506
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,039
If she is a little busy,

507
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,160
she will have no time to get emotional.

508
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,700
Is this an electronic bracelet?

509
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,640
No.

510
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,000
This is my next dream.

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,100
(Project Introduction)

512
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,850

00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,425
(Existing bracelets in the market)

514
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,119
Here are some product designs

515
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,680
and some color schemes for bracelets.

516
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,160
You can take a look.

517
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,480
There is a gap
between ideal and reality.

518
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,825
It's a good idea

519
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:29,680
to use bracelets

520
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,400
for automatic disinfectant spray.

521
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,160
But in real life,

522
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,720
there are no such tiny atomizing devices

523
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,975
that can be put inside a bracelet.

524
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Our design should be people-oriented.

525
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,799
(Bracelet color scheme 2)
I think it's feasible to come up

526
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,920
(Bracelet color scheme 2)
with ideas first and then find solutions.

527
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,400
BQ is a design company.

528
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
We design for our clients.

529
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,640
We don't create our own products
out of thin air.

530
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,880
Pass.

531
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,000
Next one.

532
00:27:58,275 --> 00:27:58,979
It's okay.

533
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,720
I've seen all your designs.

534
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,039
It's true that BQ is a design company.

535
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,279
What we have to do is to become
our clients' paper and pencil

536
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,759
to perfect the product.

537
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,400
But Philippe Starck once said,

538
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,160
"Never put limits on yourself."

539
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,839
Isn't this bracelet

540
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,960
pushing the envelope?

541
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,200
From the perspective of feasibility,

542
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,440
some domestic
scientific research institutions

543
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,920
have developed miniature atomizers

544
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,119
that can be mass produced.

545
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,519
Therefore,

546
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,200
we can start with the bracelet

547
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,200
and set up our own product brand.

548
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,599
But Mr. Xiao,

549
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,839
this is too hasty.

550
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,799
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

551
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,839
I'm just waiting for the right product

552
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,599
to start to do it.

553
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,400
I need your full cooperation.

554
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,559
I believe

555
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,039
this bracelet

556
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,799
will be marketable.

557
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,759
Isn't he a major client of BQ?

558
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,925
He has a great say here.

559
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,440
Client?

560
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,720
He is the boss.

561
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,680
Sister Ye.

562
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,550
Miss Ruting.

563
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,500
Call me Miss Ye.

564
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,039
Miss Ye, well,

565
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,960
there's a meeting
you need to attend later.

566
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
It's about
the City Floating Garden Project.

567
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,240
I said I'm not interested
in this project.

568
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,799
Ask for leave for me.

569
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,960
All right.

570
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,375
(Where are you? I'll come to you.)

571
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,759
Why did you come to pick me up
at the company?

572
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,440
My dad's still here.

573
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,160
I'm here for Mr. Ye.

574
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,160
Xie Duanxi, this is the company.

575
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,375
We can talk after we go back.

576
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,480
We have to talk here.

577
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,625
Xie Duanxi.

578
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,680
Don't be impulsive.

579
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,039
My dad kept me at the company
for my good.

580
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,599
I'm trying to make you

581
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,960
work better here.

582
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,680
What?

583
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,559
Xie Duanxi!

584
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,200
What do you want to do?

585
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:49,640
Mr. Ye.

586
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,799
Hello, Mr. Xie.

587
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Come on, sit down.

588
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,160
Dad, I can explain...

589
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,000
Mr. Xie?

590
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,559
Well?

591
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,400
What do you want to explain?

592
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,950
Let Mr. Xie speak first.

593
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,839
My tutor is in charge

594
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,920
of the City Floating Garden Project.

595
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,720
He is abroad and hasn't come back yet.

596
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,599
Therefore,

597
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,825
(City Floating Garden Project)

598
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,119
I'll be in charge of the project
for the time being.

599
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,800
By the way, Ruting.

600
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,920
Didn't you just ask for leave?

601
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,039
Granted.

602
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,519
I didn't.

603
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,319
This project

604
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,880
is very important
for the future development

605
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,680
of our company.

606
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,799
I'm obligated to be personally involved

607
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,359
and conduct in-depth communication

608
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,119
in all aspects
with our partner at any time.

609
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:44,279
Mr. Xie.

610
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,119
Let's start.

611
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,759
Since when do you care so much

612
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,240
about the company?

613
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,759
Since now.

614
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,160
Why are you still here?

615
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,960
They want the bracelet plan
tomorrow morning.

616
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:45,079
I'll let them change the deadline
to tomorrow afternoon,

617
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,559
and then you don't have to stay up late.

618
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,720
You can do it tomorrow morning

619
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,000
It's okay. I'll finish it today.

620
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,359
Are you waiting for hot water?

621
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,075
I think it's broken.

622
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,519
I know what to do.

623
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,375
Can you use the coffeemaker like that?

624
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,480
Design is people-oriented,

625
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,960
but it also requires us to be flexible.

626
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,000
What else would you like to eat?

627
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,039
I'll order for you.

628
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,000
No need.

629
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,960
I've had dinner tonight.

630
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,720
Mr. Xiao, we won't bother you.

631
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,440
Why are you here?

632
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,400
You're staying up late alone at work.

633
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm worried that you would get hungry.

634
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,759
Mr. Xiao.

635
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,559
Have some?

636
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,800
No, thanks.

637
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,519
It's late.

638
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,650
Mr. Xiao, why are you still here?

639
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,825
Let me reintroduce him to you.

640
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,639
This is my boss, Xiao Yi.

641
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,119
Mr. Xiao, don't you
need to go to the bar?

642
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,280
It's late.

643
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,050
Someone's watching over there.

644
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,400
The bracelet will be launched soon.

645
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,360
Everybody's pretty busy.

646
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,159
I'll leave you to your work then.

647
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,679
I still have work to do upstairs.

648
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,840
Go ahead and do your work.

649
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,519
I'll take Linlin home later.

650
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,400
Don't bother, Mr. Xiao.

651
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,639
This is what I should do.

652
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,039
Let me know when you're done.

653
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,760
I'll pick you up
no matter how late it is.

654
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,975
I hope you and Linlin

655
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,000
will enjoy your work.

656
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,075
Do what you need to do.

657
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,480
I'll send it to you tomorrow morning
when I'm done.

658
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,280
Okay.

659
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:05,679
Thank you.

660
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,639
You haven't left yet.

661
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,480
I'm waiting for Linlin.

662
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,559
It must be a lot of pressure

663
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,225
to rent this place for your start-up.

664
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:42,850
Yeah.

665
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,079
