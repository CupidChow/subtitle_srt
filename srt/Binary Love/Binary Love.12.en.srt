Sorry.

00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,759
You can come at me.

29
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,360
But...

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,960
Just go.

31
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,000
Who are you?

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,919
It's okay. I'll take care of this.

Someone is injured!

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,675
Be careful.

37
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,100
- Doctor, we need help.
- What happened?

38
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,280
The school doctor has examined her.

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
She feels pain in this place.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,919
It is suspected of appendicitis.

41
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,599
Please take a look at her.

42
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,319
Here.

43
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,039
Take away your hand.

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,599
It hurts.

45
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,919
Come on, turn her over.

46
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,479
Be careful.

47
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,520
It hurts!

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,159
It could also be kidney stones.

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
Hurry. Get her to the emergency room

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,319
to run some tests.

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,039
Linlin, you're almost there.

52
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,759
Hang in there.

How is Linlin doing?

Hello. How's the patient
who just went inside?

57
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,425
She is undergoing treatment.

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,560
Your injury looks pretty bad, too.

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,550
You should treat it now.

60
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:52,960
Thank you.

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Go ahead. I'll stay here.

62
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,919
No. I'll wait for her here.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,879
Linlin needs someone
to take care of her now.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,120
You have such a bad injury.

65
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,719
You can come back when she wakes up.

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
I'll let you know
the first time she wakes up.

(Outpatient Department)

68
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,474
(Emergency Room)
Doctor.

69
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:23,725
How's the patient in there?

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,720
According to the CT,

71
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,950
it should be a kidney stone.

72
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,519
But it's not big.

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,199
The patient can pass it on her own.

74
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
She'll recover after being given fluids

75
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,600
and anti-inflammatory drugs.

76
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,199
Is there anything
we should pay attention to?

77
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,199
Make sure she will drink more water
and do more jumps.

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,959
It can help her pass the stone.

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
Jumping rope will also work.

80
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,425
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

81
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,325
Linlin, you're awake.

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,279
How are you feeling now?
Are you still in pain?

83
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,360
Would you like something to eat?

84
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:54,839
Where is Fang Yuke?

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Lie here and don't move.

86
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,725
I'll see how he is doing now.

87
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:21,279
Don't move your hand after you go back.

88
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,959
You need to avoid certain food
and keep your hand from water.

89

Wen Tao!

90
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,560
- You can leave after having some rest.
- How is your hand?

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Thank you.

92
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,120
How is Linlin?

93
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,040
The doctor said it's a kidney stone.

94
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
But it's not serious.
She's been put on a drip.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,750
Where is she now?

96
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,279
In the emergency room.

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,279

Linlin should drink more water.

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,600
Linlin.

101
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,700
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

102
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,275
I'm fine.

103
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,040
How is your hand?

104
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,399
It's okay.

105
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,759
See?

106
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,720
Don't move your hand around.

107
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:37,360
Are you still in pain?

108
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,920
The doctor said
I should just get some rest.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,839
I'm hungry.

110
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,759
Let's go get something to eat later.

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,480
The doctor said
you're not fully recovered yet.

112
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,199
You have limited food choices.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,680
You need to...

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
You need to drink more water.

115
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,925
Yeah.

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,425
Fang Yuke!

117
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,319
Doctor! Nurse!

118
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,720
What's wrong with him?

119
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,720
Go find someone first.

120
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,400
Okay.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,759
Hello, can you hear me?

122
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,600
The patient has a mild concussion
from the car accident.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,399
He needs to stay overnight
for observation.

124
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,839
Doctor, is there anything
I should pay attention to

125
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,720
when I take care of him?

126
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,600
He will have dizziness
and a headache in the next few days,

127
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,319
but don't worry too much.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,920
The symptoms

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
will disappear in three to five days.

130
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,480
Right now his injured arm
is more serious.

131
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,439
It needs more attention.

132
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:53,560
It was just an ordinary fracture,

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
but it became severe
due to excessive stretching.

134
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,240
Don't worry too much about it.

135
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,959
Take care of yourself first.

136
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
Have the drip first

137
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,279
and go through
the admission formalities later.

138
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,519
Thank you, Doctor.

139
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,800
You're welcome.

140
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,879
Have some good rest.

141
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,100
(Inpatient Department)

142
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,519
Where are they?

143
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,480
We've been going in circles.

144
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,399
Keep your voice down.
We're in hospital.

145
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,679
I told you to come earlier.

146
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,879
But we had classes all the afternoon.

147
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,919
Call Fang Yuke.

148
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,375
I called him, but he didn't answer.

149
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,399
Come on, they're here.

150
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,639
Let me see.

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,120
Let me see.

152
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,519
What's going on?

153
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,480
Why is Fang Yuke lying in bed?

154
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,279
Isn't Zhou Linlin sick?

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,039
Do you think the four of us

156
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,120
look like mistresses?

157
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,240
Mis...

158
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,080
What do you mean?

159
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,159
- All right, all right.
- I don't know.

160
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,200
Let's leave it to the nurse.

161
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,600
Let's go.

162
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,500
But since we're here,
we should go in and take a look.

163
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,850
- Just go.
- Go.

164
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,525
Go.

165
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,525
But...

166
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Fang Yuke.

167
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,879
Thank you.

(Inpatient Department)

169
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,159
I don't believe it.

170
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,600
There's no environment I can't adapt to.

171
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,759
You can't help it, right?

172
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,519
I've been waiting for you
for half an hour.

173
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,279
Are you here so late
because you miss me?

174
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't you feel itchy?

175
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,240
No.

176
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,200
Why are you wearing the mosquito net?

177
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,679
The mosquito net was ill-designed.

178
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,639
I can't hang it up at all.

179
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,440
Let me do it for you.

180
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,200
You...

181
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,600
Is that how you're gonna hang it up?

182
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,559
I thought I can untie it directly.

183
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,759
Do you need my help?

184
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,240
I need you to sit here.

185
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,000
All right, I'll take care of the rest.

186
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Tuck it in like this,

187
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,840
then the mosquitoes won't get in.

188
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm gonna go.

189
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,279
Let me see you out.

190
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,519
Stop.

191
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,399
You'd better stay in there.

192
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,440
Thank you, little mosquito.

193
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:42,799
What's this?

194
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,880
Solanum rootstock seedlings.

195
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:46,759
These are for grafting.

196
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,839
Common cherry tomatoes

197
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,680
are susceptible

198
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,480
to verticillium wilt
and bacterial wilt during growth.

199
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Only by grafting seedlings

200
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,000
onto solanum rootstocks

201
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,400
can they be protected

202
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,880
and grow the best fruit.

203
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,680
So, do you want to try it?

204
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,680
Who wants to try it?

205
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,519
What are you doing?

206
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,725
Making a wish.

207
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,240
When it blooms,

208
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,799
you'll fall in love with me.

209
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,850
Do you think

210
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,359
you will fall in love with me?

211
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,839
Don't put too much pressure
on the seedlings,

212
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,640
or they won't dare to bloom.

213
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,400
(Outpatient Department)

214
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,079
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

215
00:19:57,495 --> 00:20:03,875
(Nanshan, TAXI, Empty)

216
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,680
Sir, go to Xinyuan Residence.

217
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:11,275
(Outpatient Department)

218
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,359
Thank you

219
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,960
for last night.

220
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,279
You're welcome.

221
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,160
You wouldn't have been hurt

222
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,440
if it wasn't for me.

223
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,000
Get some sleep.

224
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
It will take a while before we get home.

225
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,119
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

226
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,775
Mm.

227
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,519
I'll go back then. Have some rest.

228
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,440
Don't go back.

229
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,680
What's wrong?

230
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,240
You haven't eaten anything all day.

231
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
You must be hungry.

232
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
I'll order some takeouts
and we can eat together.

233
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,960
Ms. Chen Pingping once said,

234
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,799
you'd better buy a pot
and cook yourself.

235
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,519
Takeouts will never be as healthy
as the food we make ourselves.

236
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,000
Can you cook?

237
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,160
It shouldn't be hard.

238
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,160
Let's cook together then?

239
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,025
Okay.

240
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,400
- Welcome back!
- Welcome back!

241
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,199
(What doesn't kill you makes you better)
Welcome back!

242
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,500
How did you get in here?

243
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,160
Boss asked us to clean the house up.

244
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,279
I asked you to clean up here,

245
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,920
but I didn't ask you to decorate it.

246
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,279
A famous person once said

247
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,440
good friends grow old together.

248
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,440
Fang Yuke had surgery,

249
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,759
and we'll take care of him together!

250
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,759
But Fang Yuke didn't have surgery.

251
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,400
It's about rhyming.

252
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,359
You know nothing.

253
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,240
- Just shut your mouth.
- Jesus.

254
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,039
Boss, this is the schedule
we worked out.

255
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,640
We will take turns each day
to look after you.

256
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,039
Ding, say something!

257
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,480
Well said. Take this!

258
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,119
Sorry.

259
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:15,960
Be careful!

260
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,575
Come on.

261
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,960
Why can't we talk outside?

262
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,079
Take them out of here right now.

263
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,160
Why?

264
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,225
The doctor said

265
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,599
Fang Yuke needs to rest
after leaving the hospital.

266
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
Really?

267
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,960
We can also take care of you.

268
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
We promise not to make any noise.

269
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,680
I need to talk to Fang Yuke,

270
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,079
just the two of us. Do you get it now?

271
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,799
Our Linlin has finally grown up!

272
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
Just go.

273
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,200
What secrets do you have

274
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,319
that I'm not supposed to know?

275
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,519
Linlin needs some space, okay?

276
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,240
Just go.

277
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,880
Go. Go.

278
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,600
Play this.

279
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,599
Who's that?

280
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,079
Pack your things and leave with me!

281
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,400
Leave? I just sat down.

282
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,559
My butt is still cold.

283
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
I just got a call.

284
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,359
There's an important meeting at school

285
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,279
that we need to attend.

286
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,599
What meeting is it?

287
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,920
Why should I, a different major,
also attend it?

288
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,880
I'm not going.

289
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,200
I said there is a meeting,
and there is a meeting!

290
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,279
Do what I say and leave with me!

291
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,160
But...

292
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,480
Well, isn't the schedule
I worked out wasted?

293
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,279
Schedule?

294
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,039
Does it hurt?

295
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:42,861
Yeah.

296
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,133
It's so annoying. My head hurts.

297
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,319
Do you want to hang out
with your schedule?

298
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,279
No, I don't.

299
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,119
Leave with me then!

300
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,000
Zhu Li, show me some respect.

301
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,359
Hurry up.

302
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:00,950
Oh.

303
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,725
Is your hand all right?

304
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,125
It's okay.

305
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,720
Sorry, I forgot my bag.

306
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,900
You two go on. Go on.

307
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,920
Let me take these off for you.

308
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:43,100
Okay.

309
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,759
Be careful.

310
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,000
All right.

311
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,000
One more round.

312
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,600
What was I going to do?

313
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,100
You...

314
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,240
We... we're cleaning up.

315
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,519
Oh, clean up.

316
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,119
It's good to be clean. You two go on.

317
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,600
We're really cleaning up.

318
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,160
All right, come on! I'll see you again!

319
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,225
Or never!

320
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,425
You...

321
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,839
Are you okay?

322
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:04,799
I'm fine.

323
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,839
Well, I won't
take these off for you then.

324
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,119
You can do it yourself later.

325
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,850
Slippers.

326
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,799
I'll go make some porridge
and come back later.

327
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,160
Who allowed you to look so alike?

328
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,160
They're just cherry tomatoes.

329
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,720
I can't talk to animals.

330
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
Can't I even talk to plants?

331
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,375
This one.

332
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,200
How can you recognize it at a glance?

333
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,850
Of course I can.

334
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,559
You must bloom.

335
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,720
Do you hear me?

336
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:55,799
Linlin!

337
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,720
Wait a minute!

338
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,175
Coming!

339
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,599
Who's it?

340
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,119
Congratulations on leaving the hospital.

341
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,799
Why are you here?

342
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,759
It smells so good.

343
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,119
Is that for me?

344
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,680
Did you know I was coming?

345
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,319
No, no, it's not for you.

346
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,000
Don't touch it.

347
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,359
If it's not for me, who is it for then?

348
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,000
Fang Yuke?

349
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,650
Yeah.

350
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,400
You're still sick.

351
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,680
Why do you take care of him?

352
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,240
The doctor said he has a mild concussion

353
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,250
and needs rest.

354
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,319
Don't you have training today?

355
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,000
We have a day off today.

356
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,880
So I'm here to see you.

357
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,519
And Fang Yuke.

358
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,240
Are you here to see Fang Yuke?

359
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,920
He needs rest now.

360
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,079
Don't disturb him.

361
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,160
Why can't I see Fang Yuke?

362
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,720
Mr. Fang helped me a lot

363
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,920
with my English.

364
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm always grateful.

365
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,359
Isn't it natural
that I'm here to see him?

366
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,025
What is this?

367
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,079
It's for you.

368
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,039
The doctor said jumping ropes
can help you pass the stone.

369
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
There are both ropes in these two bags.

370
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,039
You may use whichever you like.

371
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,200
Thank you.

372
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,279
Let's go.

373
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,160
Let's go to see Mr. Fang.

374
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,079
The porridge will get cold later.

375
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,225
It's hot.

376
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,039
Hurry up.

377
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,680
Mr. Fang, I'm here to see you.

378
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,160
I'll get the porridge first.

379
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,960
There are many guests today.

380
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,079
He said he's here to pay you a favor
for teaching him English.

381
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,400
What happened to your hand?

382
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,839
I just burnt it.

383
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,079
I've run water over it. I'm fine.

384
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,880
It's red now. You're not fine.

385
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,839
Come on.

386
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The porridge will get cold
if we don't eat it now.

387
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,599
Linlin, it's super delicious.

388
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,240
Thank you.

389
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,125
Let me do it.

390
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:52,880
Put it here, put it here.

391
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:53,960
Let me do it.

392
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,000
Come on, Mr. Fang.

393
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,300
I can eat myself...

394
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,039
It takes a hundred days for the bone
to knit and tendons to heal.

395
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,480
Linlin said you have
a mild concussion.

396
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,325
You must be more careful these days.

397
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,799
Here, one more gulp.

398
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,079
I'll take care of Mr. Fang

399
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,720
in the next few days.

400
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,319
- You?
- You?

401
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:27,370
Yeah.

402
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,550
What's the problem?

403
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,039
You're too busy training.
You don't need to do it.

404
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,559
You were busy studying, too.

405
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,440
You still helped me with my English.

406
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,640
It's called tit-for-tat.

407
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,680
- I...
- I can't forget your help.

408
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,475
Is it a little hot?

409
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,440
Well, I live closer to him.

410
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,880
It's convenient for me
to take care of him.

411
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,880
It's the end of the term.

412
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,960
You should focus on
working on your design homework.

413
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm an athlete. I got hurt a lot.

414
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,480
I have more experience
in this area than you.

415
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,480
There is no porridge left.

416
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,900
Mr. Fang, I'll get you more.

417
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,359
I might as well have Big Mouth
and Ding stay.

418
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm thirsty.

419
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,680
Can you get me a glass of water?

420
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,200
Would you like it cold or warm?

421
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,839
Here comes the water!

422
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,720
One cold and one warm.

423
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,519
Why are you staring at me?

424
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,559
Don't you want water?

425
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,279
Drink it.

426
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,039
Linlin, we should go now.

427
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,160
Let Mr. Fang have a good rest.

428
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,181
Oh.

429
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,519
I want to talk to you.

430
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Linlin is also a patient.

431
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,920
She needs to rest now, too.

432
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,300
See you tonight.

433
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,631
(I'll jump rope with you at 11:00 PM.)

434
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,200
You have a lot of strength to use.

435
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,550
Don't you have training tomorrow?

436
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:06,839
It's still early.

437
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,360
Let's not worry about tomorrow.

438
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,679
I'll have fun with my teacher tonight.

439
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,239
Do you want popcorn?

440
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,119
No.

441
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,239
Have some water.

442
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,000
No.

443
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,920
Are you worried that you'll
go to the bathroom at night?

444
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,250
Don't worry.

445
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,639
I'll take good care of you.

446
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,360
I can take care of myself.

447
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,519
Just go back to sleep.

448
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,519
I'm gonna stay here tonight.

449
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,079
I only have one bed,

450
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,760
and my couch is narrow.

451
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,960
You won't be comfortable living here.

452
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,079
It's okay.

453
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,360
I have a sleeping bag.

454
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
When did you prepare it?

455
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,280
I just sent Lin Ze a message on WeChat

456
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,239
and asked him to bring it to me.

457
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,719
I didn't want him
to interrupt our movie,

458
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,000
so I asked him to put it in the hallway.

459
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,079
You are well-prepared.

460
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,760
Still not good enough
compared with your 10,000 questions.

461
00:36:58,575 --> 00:36:59,400
Fang Yuke.

462
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,719
What are you two doing?

463
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:20,325
(Little Theater of Unrequited love)

464
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:51,925
Mr. Fang.

465
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,960
You...

466
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,079
Why are you still up?

467
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,760
Where are you going alone late at night?

468
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,159
I'm going out for some air.

469
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,325
No, it's not safe to be alone at night,

470
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:09,119
and it's not convenient for you.

471
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,639
Don't hurt the other hand.

472
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm okay.

473
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,639
Just go to sleep.

474
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:17,825
No.

475
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,199
I have to be with you tonight.

476
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,525
Mr. Fang.

477
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,280
What are you doing?

478
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,039
I heard some noise.

479
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,440
Do you need any help?

480
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,360
No.

481
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,025
It must be uncomfortable for you

482
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,519
to sleep with your clothes on.

483
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,400
Let me take your clothes off.

484
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
No, no.

485
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,750
Don't touch me!

486
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,875
I'll hurt you if you come closer.

487
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,880
I told you to feel free
to ask me for help.

488
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,975
Don't move, don't move. Your wound.

489
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,360
Come on. Right.

490
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,519
It's stuck.

491
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,559
I'll pull it out for you.

492
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,175
