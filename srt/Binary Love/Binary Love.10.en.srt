how did it feel?

I didn't feel a thing.

No way.

you wouldn't have asked me.

When you're sad,

00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,720
you can do sports.

133
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,000
When you do sports,

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,159
you'll sweat

Why do you bother about him?

140
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,000
Leave him in the daydream.

141

We're in a hurry for the class. Go.

Linlin said thank you.

First, he kissed you unexpectedly.

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,120
Then, he bought you breakfast.

150
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,120
Are you still my bestie?

151
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,440
I am and that's why I'm trying to help.

Do you understand?

I don't.

154
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,120
Don't pretend you understand, either.

155
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,639
How could I not understand?

156
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,399
There are only 70 days
before you hand in the final project.

157
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,879
Sketching is

158
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,200
a very important step.

159
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,200
It's the guidance for our overall plan

160
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,480
and the basic foundation

161

- for the further engineering stage.

164
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,519
During the sketching,

165
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,840
you couldn't be too careful.

166
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,600
You should express your design ideas

167
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,720
and thoughts.

168
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,480
Meanwhile,

169
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,720
you should consider
the user experience in advance.

170
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,240
Are you already

171
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,240
waiting for the user's feedback?

172
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,126
I'll do the sketching immediately.

173
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,720
Zhou Linlin,

174
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,600
what have you done already?

175
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,039
I'm working on the engineering drawing.

176
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,360
Good.

177
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,159
Keep it up.

178
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:14,275
Hey.

179
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,639
Why hasn't Wen Tao come recently?

180
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,465
Did he give up already?

181
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,559
He'll have a match.
His team is having a confined training.

182
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:24,879
How do you know what?

183
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,919
Because I'm in the chat group
of the sports team.

184
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,386
(Southern University)

185
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Go back to the dorm without me.

186
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,000
I've got something else to do.

187
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,919
Okay. Fine.

188
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,639
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

189
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,950
That's true.

190
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,480
Fang Yuke.

191
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,919
Are you waiting for me?

192
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,320
I have something to tell you.

193
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:09,679
Come with me.

194
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,559
I just want

195
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,639
to talk about what happened that day.

196
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,120
I get it.

197
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,360
Go ahead.

198
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,480
I just can't accept

199
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
that my good friend
professed his love to me.

200
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,080
It's hard to describe my feelings.

201
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,559
I just feel that we can
no longer be friends.

202
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,960
Are you saying

203
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,879
that I can be your boyfriend instead?

204
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,039
No.

205
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,840
After you professed your love,

206
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,440
you even...

207
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,279
Kissed you.

208
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
Don't emphasize it. I know that.

209
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,879
We know the basic story.

210
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,519
I think we've just been on the mend.

211
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,399
You're still Fang Yuke
who grew up with me.

212
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,440
I never expected our relationship

213
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,080
to change like this.

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,960
This is so abrupt.

215
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,519
So, do you mean

216
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,960
you want us

217
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,320
to move backward

218
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,320
and be friends again?

219
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,679
This isn't a game.

220
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,000
How can we move forward or backward?

221
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,759
I mean I need some time

222
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,559
to consider our relationship.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
No matter what your decision is,

224
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,399
I will always wait for you.

225
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,360
I... I need some space, too.

226
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,000
I should go.

227
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,320
Where else could he be

228
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,960
at this time of day?

229
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,080
He's gone to the plant base
in Nanming County, Nanshan,

230
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,950
for his internship.

231
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,919
When will he come back then?

232
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,960
I'm not sure.

233
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,159
Why don't you text him?

234
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,960
Thank you, sir.

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,320
I'm not sure I caught your name.

236
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,360
My name is Zhu Gong.
[*Zhu Gong: Sounds like a helper in love.]

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,650
Ah?

238
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,159
(Notice)
Because the operating board is damaged,

239
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,279
(Notice)
the school has decided to renovate the studio.

240
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,399
By the end of this semester,

241
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,600
the studio will have been closed.

242
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
What happened? Why so sudden?

243
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,120
We can't do our homework
in the studio then.

244
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,480
But we are on a serious time crunch.

245
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,440
How can we do our homework?

246
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,279
We have to rent an apartment.

247
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,480
Good idea.

248
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,240
But our university is downtown.

249
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,825
We have to pay a high rent.

250
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,000
Linlin,

251
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,480
have you rented an apartment yet?

252
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,000
No. The rent is way too high.

253
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,200
Shall we share one apartment?

254
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,919
The rent will be low, then.

255
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,879
I find it good to live in the dorm.

256
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,279
Won't you disturb others?

257
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,360
If you all move out,

258
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,960
who can I disturb?

259
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,759
What about you, Zhu Li?

260
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,799
I need to rent an apartment.

261
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,559
But I have my own private life.

262
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,080
Ruting,

263
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,799
would you like to rent an apartment?

264
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,120
It's near our school
and we can do our homework there.

265
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
No. I've done my homework.

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,960
Done?

267
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,120
I gave the drawing to the factory.

268
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,399
They'll manufacture it soon.

269
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,919
Tomorrow, I'm going to the plant base

270
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:35,840
for Xie Duanxi.

271
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,120
The cost of your homework is too high.

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,759
Come on.

273
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,240
You could have paid us

274
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,679
to do the homework for you.

275
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,654
Mm.

276
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:46,900
Mm.

277
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:49,080
Too late.

278
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,679
I'll give the priority to you next time.

279
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,919
Is it inconvenient to visit a plant base

280
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,360
in a dress?

281
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,799
In this world,

282
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,559
nowhere is inconvenient for dresses.

283
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
What happened? Why the long faces?

284
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,920
The studio of the Department of Design

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,119
will be renovated.

286
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,079
Zhu Li

287
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
wants to rent an apartment.

288
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,680
(Apartments to rent)
We're checking the apartments for her.

289
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,160
Does Zhou Linlin

290
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,319
have to rent an apartment, too?

291
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,240
Yeah.

292
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,559
She and her roommates

293
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,799
have been looking for apartments.

294
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,559
Don't you know?

295
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
In my opinion,

296
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
Zhu Li is way too fastidious.

297
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,200
She complains about every apartment.

298
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,920
What the heck!

299
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,720
The price is really
a little bit expensive

300
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,119
for college students.

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,839
Yeah.

302
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,000
But they don't have another option.

303
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,519
They have to move out.

304
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,400
Otherwise, their final projects
couldn't be done.

305
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,640
Let's check this out.

306
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,200
It's too expensive.

307
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,400
What about this one?

308
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,240
Looks good.

309
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,680
- This one?
- This one looks appropriate.

310
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,839
But the rent is higher.

311
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,359
But it's big.

312
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,119
Big? Fine.

313
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,200
But the rent is indeed high.

314
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:39,000
(Excuse me.)

315
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,799
(Are you a house agent?)

316
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,161
- (I read about the rental information)
- It's big.

317
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:42,750
- (you posted.)
- It's big.

318
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,200
(I would like to know about it.)

319
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,440
Watch out. Watch out.

320
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,640
Be careful.

321
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,400
This is too heavy.

322
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,400
Luckily, it's not scratched.

323
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,920
Which matters more,
the operating board or me?

324
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,480
The operating board.

325
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,000
I can only be back for half a day.

326
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,160
And you asked me

327
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,400
to move the desk and buy some plants
for the degradation of formaldehyde.

328
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,960
You went to the plant base?

329
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,160
What about Ruting?

330
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:27,839
Don't bother about me.

331
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,000
Fine, I don't bother about you.

332
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,839
You don't bother about me, either.

333
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,599
Bye-bye.

334
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:36,759
I won't see you out.

335
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,599
Why are you not leaving yet?

336
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,279
I should at least move the desk.

337
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,079
Be careful not to hurt your hands.

338
