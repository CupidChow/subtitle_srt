don't you miss him?

124

00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm kind of worried.

170
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,559
Don't worry.

171
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,475
He will be fine.

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,875
Linlin, are you inside?

173
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,400
Fang Yuke?

174
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,300
Isn't the building locked down?

175
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,339
How did he get in?

176
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,000
What are you doing here?

177
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
I applied to be a volunteer,

178
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:00,665
delivering meals to students at school.

179
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,675
I've hung your lunch on the doorknob.

180
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't come out to get them
until we leave.

181
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,120
Remember.

182
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,225
After you touch the plastic bag,

183
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:09,265
disinfect your hands.

184
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,350
We can't get out of the dorm
so we're safe.

185
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,679
You should take care.

186
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,875
Rest assured.

187
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,200
We're provided
with full protective clothing.

188
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,900
Fang Yuke, hurry.

189
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,740
We're going to the next building.

190
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,375
Oh.

191
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,080
Linlin, I have to go.

192
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,500
I'll bring you dinner tonight.

193
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,600
Be very careful

194
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,825
and take good care of yourself.

195
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,200
Mm. Bye-bye.

196
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,575
Are you trying to jump for him?

197
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,750
Fang Yuke!

198
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,440
You all are waving your hands.

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,900
How can I recognize him?

200
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,175
You're all right now?

201
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,720
He texted me back.

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,075
No big deal.

203
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,690
He just asked to break up with me.

204
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,840
Don't be too sad.

A box of masks.

206

- Mr. Zhu,
- Hotpot...

207

I've been recording
the experimental data.

208
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,320
Nothing abnormal.

209

With me taking care of the plants here,

210
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,575

it's...

215

It's not as hard as I imagined.

216
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,875
Mr. Zhu,

217
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,625
may I apply for something?

218
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,720
The water supply system of our lab

219
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,039
was installed by a student

220

from the Department
of Industrial Design.

221
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,275
I don't think I can operate it alone.

222
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,625
So, may I ask her

223

I picked them from the Incubation Room.

Some plants are edible and some are not.

Some are rare species and some are food.

I can distinguish them very well.

259

You're not interested in plants at all.

How did you get to know
about them without a teacher?
