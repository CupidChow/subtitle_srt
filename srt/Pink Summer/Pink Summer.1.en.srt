1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,400
Why don't you hug him?

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,683
When did you and Gu Senhe start falling in love?

3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,850
Mom, I had iced watermelon in the morning. I

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,366
ate

5
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:26,556
Sensen's

6
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:28,533
mung bean soup. I need to add sugar.

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,483
His mother went out of town and came

8
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:35,055
to our house for two days. Is there something wrong with

9
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:35,766
sleeping with you

10
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,133
?

11
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,050
You have dark circles. Why is it so heavy?

12
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,400
You have a bad waist.

13
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,713
Well,

14
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:06,213
why is there a headband

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,533
in the Chinese Valentine's Day special issue

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,250
? What kind of headband?

17
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,250
This is the red thread of fate .

18
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:13,450
This is a mysterious love divination magic

19
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,166
legend. Just tie the red thread on your wrist

20
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,050
and pray sincerely

21
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,083
, then go out and take seven left turns.

22
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,333
Why do you want to turn left when

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,650
you can meet someone you recognize

24
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:25,333
? Love comes from the heart

25
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,250
and the heart is on the left

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,366
. Who believes this nonsense?

27
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:28,650
Do

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,883
n’t

29
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:35,683
you have a heartbeat when

30
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:38,083
you don’t have you? I don’t want to know who your destiny is.

31
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:38,883
Don’t think

32
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,200
about what I’m doing

33
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,050
1

34
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,883
2 3 4

35
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:56,683
6

36
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,683
7 Why are you throwing garbage

37
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:12,933
here

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,133
?

39
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:29,966
What about destiny

40
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,166
and pounding heart?

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,483
It’s really ridiculous.

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,208
If I believe in this kind of feudal superstition again,

43
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,083
I will be a pig

44
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,933
. There’s a power outage.

45
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:43,800
I’m going to get a candle.

46
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,000
Gu Sen and have you seen it?

47
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,050
Get him off quickly.

48
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,083
Come on, don’t

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,000
move.

50
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,883
Let’s take a look.

51
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,600
Why is it swollen?

52
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:14,733
It

53
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,850
’s a bit like a pig shape.

54
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,200
That’s my birthmark.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,825
Hahaha.

56
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,050
Shit.

57
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,966
Wait a minute. There’s more. The last one,

58
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,050
uh, sorry

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,400
son, I brought you back a burning waist.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,566
A short mating session can calm them down.

61
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:54,766
I said

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,883
shut up, don’t talk,

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
does your butt still hurt?

64
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,333
This is the red thread of fate.

65
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,966
Just tie the red thread around your wrist

66
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:08,800
and pray sincerely.

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,683
Then go out and turn the seventh intersection

68
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,766
and you will meet

69
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:15,883
the person of destiny. The person of destiny,

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
look at me. Why

71
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:21,733
am I sick?

72
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,533
Let me see you

73
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,933
. Walk around.

74
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,400
Calm down. Where can

75
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,283
I go if I want to change my destiny

76
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,483
?

77
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:33,442
The first step is

78
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:34,400
to stay away from him.

79
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,083
The second step

80
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:37,566
is The third step

81
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:39,825
is to ignore

82
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:43,000
him and scold him . Hello,

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,450
it’s very late. Why don’t you come in and sleep?

84
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,683
Well,

85
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,533
why is he sitting so far away?

86
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,600
Stay away from him.

87
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,733
Hey, today is the Chinese Valentine’s Day. Do you know? Does

88
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,533
the Chinese

89
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,439
Valentine’s Day

90
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,850
have something to do with me?

91
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:09,083
This is another mysterious love divination. Magical legends say that as long as

92
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,150
you hold an orange and fall asleep

93
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,283
on the night of Chinese Valentine's Day,

94
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,683
you will be attracted by the fate of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

95
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:15,850
In your dream, you will see your

96
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,733
destined person

97
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:17,566
. Why is it an orange

98
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:19,250
? Oh, all your wishes

99
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,166
come true (orange). Such

100
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,166
nonsense.

101
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,286
This kind of thing is just lying to you. Such an ignorant girl

102
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:24,966
, believe it or not, do you

103
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,483
have a lot of shrimps here?

104
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,200
Yes, yes,

105
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,850
yes, ah, ah,

106
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,467
don't move, let me help you,

107
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,050
no, no, don't smile

108
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,083
, don't smile, don't move, I'll help you

109
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,566
, no, no, no, don't move. Don't move, don't move, I'm coming

110
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:12,333
. Fortunately, it's just a dream.

111
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:18,850
Legend has it that as long as you hold an orange to sleep on the night of Chinese Valentine's Day

112
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,250
, you will be attracted by the fate of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

113
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:22,366
I see you in your dream,

114
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,283
the destined person.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,883
What's wrong with you?

116
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:29,883
I'm a pig.

117
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,333
If this goes on, I need

118
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,166
to find a way. Ask him to move out.

119
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:57,933
Why did he wash the

120
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,450
car ? The glass was washed out. How did he wash the car?

121
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,366
The glass was washed out

122
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:01,450
. Don’t live in our house.

123
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,483
Move out.

124
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:03,283
Yes

125
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:04,200
, move out.

126
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,566
I brought you ice cream.

127
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,083
Your mother hasn’t come back from a business trip yet

128
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,083
.

129
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:59,226
Then you have lived in my house for so

130
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,000
long and don’t want to go home?

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,850
Don’t I live next door to your house?

132
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,800
Oh, yes, yes, yes, haha.

133
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,250
I want to defy the will of heaven and change the destiny

134
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,966
of the person.

135
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,566
I will lie to ignorant girls like you.

136
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,600
Stay safe. Try to find a way to get him to move out.

137
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:14,800
Auntie,

138
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:19,766
the destined one

139
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,250
. It 's very hot outside.

140
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
It's the anniversary of Jingyu's father's death

141
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,133
. Every year at this time,

142
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,050
he likes to lock himself in the room

143
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,820
alone.

144
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,275
It's so dark that you can come over and stay with Jingyu.

145
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:32,406
Don't worry, Auntie

146
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:33,532
Xiaoyu is. My best friend,

147
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:34,533
I will definitely make him happy.

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,600
The braised pork is here.

149
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,133
Tomorrow is Uncle Shen’s death anniversary.

150
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,366
We must not let Shen Jingyu stay at home.

151
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,733
Ha?

152
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,400
Let’s go fishing for crayfish tomorrow

153
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,733
. Instead of

154
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:00,766
that comic series,

155
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:02,083
let’s go out and buy it tomorrow. No,

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,200
don't go

157
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,050
there. I heard that Tianma Mountain

158
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,800
is NO.

159
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,083
Then I'll go by myself.

160
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,366
886 (byebye)

161
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,333
I'm really going to go.

162
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:15,283
Mengting

163
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,443
and

164
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,019
the salon's sister Tao are quarreling

165
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:40,883
and can't win.

166
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:43,733
Sister Tao,

167
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:53,183
since you're here,

168
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,966
you might as well let's see

169
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,733
who you are. It’s not crazy

170
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,200
to go hiking on a hot day.

171
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,013
The weather is so good.

172
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,450
Of course you have to go out and breathe fresh air.

173
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,170
Your little body

174
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,133
needs to exercise more.

175
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:22,250
Hurry up.

176
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,600
We are almost halfway up the mountain.

177
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,966
I heard that there is a particularly beautiful lake here

178
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,733
and there is a wishing pool in the lake

179
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:29,250
. Your sincere wish

180
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,966
will come true. What about

181
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,366
the lake

182
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,283
?

183
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,366
Maybe it's at the top of the mountain.

184
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,683
Why don't we climb up?

185
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:42,166
Crazy.

186
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,779
Now that we've arrived,

187
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,807
why don't I take a photo for you?

188
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:47,618
Mengting, come and join us.

189
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:48,650
Oh, it's inconvenient

190
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:49,933
. With you holding him in your arms

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,283
, this is the first time we have taken a photo together as neighbors in so many years.

192
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,733
Hey, can you take some photos

193
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:55,533
without looking up

194
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:56,366
? I'm

195
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:56,926
going to die from holding

196
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,166
my urine. Hey, the battery is out. Then I have to go to the toilet. Shen Jingyu Snake.

197
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,050
Hey

198
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,250
,

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,274
hey

200
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:24,483
, hey. Hey, hey, hey,

201
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,200
Gu Sen and don’t hit

202
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,333
the snake, run away, don’t hit,

203
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:29,683
how are you?

204
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,333
It’s okay, just

205
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,600
a little dizzy.

206
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,166
I see this snake is so green ,

207
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,283
it can’t be green bamboo leaves,

208
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,650
right? I’m not going to die, right?

209
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,250
It’s

210
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,250
okay. Don't worry

211
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:44,400
,

212
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,073
Xiaoyu. Listen to me,

213
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:46,573
life is important.

214
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:50,533
Come on, come on.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,400
I haven't shaved yet

216
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:54,283
, right

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,083
?

218
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:56,800
OK, don't move yet.

219
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll help you suck out the poisonous blood.

220
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,200
What's going on? What's going on? What's

221
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,250
going on?

222
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,450
Meng Ting You hurry up and call

223
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,000
110120130, hurry up, hurry up,

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
what’s wrong with him?

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,133
He was bitten by a venomous snake

226
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,083
.

227
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,566
Call quickly.

228
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:24,347
I remember that only cauliflower snakes

229
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:25,366
are non-

230
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,520
venomous on this mountain. Don't worry about

231
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,400
calling.

232
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,966
You don't seem to be poisoned.

233
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't make nonsense calls!

234
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,083
I'm holding it up.

235
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,400
Why is there no signal?

236
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,083
Let's bandage the wound first

237
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,250
. Oh , I, I, I have

238
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,450
a silk scarf.

239
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:46,283
Life is important

240
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,483
. Haha,

241
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,933
don't worry. Shen Jingyu

242
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,000
is probably a cauliflower snake.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,933
It's fine. It's not poisonous

244
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,650
. Why don't you leave ?

245
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,000
The car can't move

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000
.

247
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,283
Can it be done ? Okay,

248
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,933
can you take care of the old, the weak, the sick

249
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,683
, ah,

250
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
ah, ah, ah, ah, that's not what I meant,

251
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,100
ah, oh,

252
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,450
no, I can't call a tow truck,

253
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,200
there's no signal,

254
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,283
come on, come on,

255
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:43,733
can I be unlucky again today?

256
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,041
No,

257
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,083
it's not that I want that thing, right?

258
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,850
Yeah,

259
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,075
help me get it off, get it off

260
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:52,600
, hurry up, hurry up,

261
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,133
there's nothing,

262
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:01,800
face is important,

263
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,246
wait a minute,

264
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:29,966
the shit hasn't been wiped off yet,

265
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,933
Gu Senhe, help me get the phone

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,800
,

267
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:54,553
wait a minute

268
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:55,133
, comic

269
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,850
water,

270
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,987
can you finish it all at once

271
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,076
, I'm a patient

272
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:02,650
, your water.

273
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:04,683
Isn’t this water

274
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:05,733
water?

275
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,400
There are oranges next to

276
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,766
the fruit. Take it yourself

277
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:10,966
. Your attitude is too bad.

278
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,200
I’ll punish you to sleep on the sofa tonight.

279
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:14,600
What’s the matter

280
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,265
with Gu Sen?

281
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:17,765
Help me get my cell

282
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,366
phone. Isn’t this the cell phone?

283
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,850
Is it out of reach

284
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:24,683
? It’s out of reach now.

285
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,170
Hey,

286
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,085
Mengting

287
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,024
is arguing with the hair salon.

288
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:35,524
If you don't

289
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,200
go to Sister Tao,

290
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,133
after the quarrel is over

291
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:39,766
, I'm leaving.

292
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,566
Don't rush away.

293
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,450
Come and chat with me for a while.

294
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,883
What are you talking about?

295
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:47,218
When did you and Gu Senhe

296
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:48,566
start

297
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,083
so early in the third grade of elementary school

298
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:55,333
?

299
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,650
At that time, he had just moved here

300
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,933
. I let him go

301
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:12,088
and now I think

302
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:13,671
he was really handsome back then.

303
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:14,686
I thought this guy was too good

304
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:15,250
to win.

305
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,566
At that time, I thought he would be my best friend,

306
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,600
so romantic.

307
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,650
Later, he actually grew a head taller than me.

308
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,050
I have a special opinion on this.

309
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:27,366
He

310
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,400
loved to fight with others when he was a child.

311
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,566
After you moved here, he settled down a lot. He

312
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,600
is sick.

313
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,193
I want to go out to play.

314
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:34,693
Why do you ask me to do my homework?

315
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,650
Do my homework ?

316
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,483
And he always asks me something, which makes me crazy. The question is,

317
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,533
are you happy today?

318
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,533
Are you happy today?

319
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,050
Do you feel particularly happy ?

320
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,850
He should be very happy these days.

321
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,533
I feel it

322
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,083
. Isn't he weird? You should be

323
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:51,566
nicer

324
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,283
to Gu Senhe. Two

325
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,966
years ago, he was still afraid of you because of his father. Are

326
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,133
you going to take you for a ride on the anniversary of

327
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
my father's

328
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
death ? Gu Sen and

329
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,050
Xiaoyu have finished

330
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,483
eating. Let

331
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,400
's go home and eat.

332
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:12,483
I think it's

333
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,333
Shen Jingyu.

334
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:27,788
Shen Jingyu

335
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,630
should eat first.

336
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,000
He'll come out after he's had enough

337
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,883
. They're all packed up.

338
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,283
Shen Jingyu, I'm leaving. Put it

339
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:50,766
in the refrigerator. Remember to eat the watermelon

340
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,333
. Oh, the God of Plague has finally left. Gu Senhe has gone

341
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,250
to eat.

342
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,128
Gu Senhe

343
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,450
said that

344
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:23,766
he took everything

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,050
and forgot about it

346
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:34,166
. Oh , I did

347
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:37,850
n’t target you last time.

348
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:43,148
I was angry with myself

349
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:44,283
for forgetting the anniversary of my father’s death.

350
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:48,733
My dad especially likes to play "Snowman Brothers" with me.

351
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,733
At that time, we

352
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,283
passed more than 80 levels

353
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,483
in one go and were about to finish the level.

354
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:55,766
He left again,

355
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,733
so every time on the anniversary of his death,

356
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,400
I would lock myself in the room and play "Snowman". Brother, "

357
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:02,800
beat it to level 80

358
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,600
and then start over

359
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
again from the beginning

360
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,068
. Xiaoyu.

361
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:09,883
When you are unhappy,

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,844
just shout to the sky,

363
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:12,766
I am so happy.

364
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,883
This will make you feel much better

365
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,000
. Is there something wrong with you?

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You have watched too much Meteor Garden."

367
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,566
I'm so stupid,

368
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,850
so stupid, I can't shout

369
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:20,250
. I'll do it for you again.

370
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,213
I'm so happy... No, no, no, no,

371
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:22,366
brother,

372
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,366
it's too embarrassing .

373
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,250
Let's go,

374
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,000
where can we go

375
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:32,166
? I'll accompany you through the customs.

376
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,050
What 's going on

377
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,800
? I actually feel like he's a bit manly

378
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:51,566
. Who is it so

379
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,683
early in the morning ?

380
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,366
It's so noisy. Why are

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,000
they moving?

382
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:58,966
Sensen, they are moving

383
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,966
to Beijing.

384
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,050
Don't you know?

385
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
Didn't Sensen take the exam for Beijing?

386
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,483
His mother bought two factories in the suburbs of Beijing two days ago.

387
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:09,933
This was done a few days ago. When did they

388
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,283
just move? We

389
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,333
haven’t driven very far in the car.

390
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,566
Oops, it’s swollen and

391
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I got tetanus.

392
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,533
I’m exaggerating.

393
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,874
Oops, it’s not

394
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:32,133
my hand that’s injured. What’s the use of you carrying me?

395
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:39,850
That’s my birthmark

396
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,339
. Hahaha,

397
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:42,650
laugh. This is the thing

398
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,000
that’s holding you

399
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,933
. It ate all

400
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:46,817
my watermelon.

401
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:47,533
Gu Sen and

402
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,883
I are so happy.

403
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,966
I am so happy.

404
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,800
I am so happy.

405
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,966
I am so happy

406
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,450
to be back.

407
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,611
Sensen left something for you

408
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:38,533
on the table.

409
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,050
You are also my best friend.

410
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,050
I hope you who are watching this show will be happy every day.
