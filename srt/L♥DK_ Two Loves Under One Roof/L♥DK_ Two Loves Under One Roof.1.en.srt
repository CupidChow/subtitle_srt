If I win, you go to college in America.

191
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,948
Screw that.

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,102
Are you chicken?

193
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:29,633
When did you turn into such a coward?

194
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,012
What a letdown.

195
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:08,297
Yes!

196
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,420
Yes!

197
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,890
Damn.

198
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,060
Why did he take it off?

199
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,632
We won!

200
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:10,916
Dammit!

201
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,078
We're done.

202
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,065
Come back here, chicken!

203
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,317
The basketball club's waiting.

204
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,723
Got a girl?

205
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,100
Shu,

206
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,160
it's said that you've got a girlfriend at this school.

207
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,360
She's the reason you won't

208
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,340
study in America, right?

209
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,030
Yeah, that's right.

210
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,380
So what?

211
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,752
Who is she? Introduce me.

212
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,848
None of your business.

213
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:06,866
I knew he might be taken, but it's a shock.

214
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,185
Shusei-kun's girl has gotta be beautiful.

215
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:14,105
True. I bet she's got style, intelligence,

216
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,475
and a nice body with big boobs.

217
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,580
I'll find out...

219
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,791
What if people find out?

220
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,587
Don't worry. I know they won't.

221
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:38,505
How can you be so sure?

222
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:40,516
Your tiny boobs.

223
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,968
This is no time for jokes!

224
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,279
I wasn't joking.

225
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,716
Done. Okay.

226
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,910
Thanks.

227
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,441
Hey, can I ask you something?

228
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,260
You asked Reon for info on America's colleges...

229
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,730
but why?

230
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,928
I wanted to know what they're like.

231
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,338
But I won't go.

232
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,916
- Really?
- Yes.

233
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,510
What a relief!

234
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,458
When Reon-kun said that, I was so surprised.

235
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:34,410
Sorry about that. He tends to get misunderstood,

236
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,754
but he's actually a good guy.

237
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,765
After all, he's your cousin.

238
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:43,861
We played together a lot as kids.

239
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,310
He's not just my cousin,

240
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,780
he's more like my best friend.

241
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:52,770
Best friend, huh?

242
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,474
That reminds me...

243
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:07,278
What are you doing?

244
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:10,013
Preparing tomorrow's breakfast.

245
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:12,800
This mince was on sale,

246
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,760
so I froze it in small portions.

247
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:18,372
It'll be pork nikujaga, not beef...
(T/N: meat and potato stew)

248
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:21,267
Being thrifty's hard.

249

No, being resourceful is fun.

Funny face.

Don't! Silly.

He's so cool!

Please read this!

No way! He looked at me!

- Hey.
- Yes?

Come to my place.

00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,483
I will!

270
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,503
Actually, don't.

271
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,506
Is he hitting on girls so early?

272
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:12,109
Americans are so brash...

273
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,972
Can we talk?

00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:18,216

275
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,093
Do you have a boyfriend?

276
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,096
No, I don't.

277
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,666
Too bad.

278
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,030
He is so hot.

Can we talk?

280
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,010
Yes.

281
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,786
Do you wanna go see a movie?

282
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:42,315
Sorry. Actually, I've got a boyfriend.

283
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,600
Is he hotter than me?

284
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:51,199
Not at all! Okay, let's see a movie!

285
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,253
It's not her, either.

Hey! Come back here!

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,377
What's wrong with you? Hitting on girls randomly...

289
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:14,423
Not randomly. I choose each one carefully.

290
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:18,876
Nice bodies and big boobs. Shu's type of girl.

291
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,179
W-Why do that?

292
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,181
To find Shu's girlfriend.

293
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:28,354
The girl he fell for. She wouldn't fall for me so easily.

294
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:34,409
But all those girls fell so quickly, they nearly got nosebleeds.

295
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,863
Shu's girl won't be so easy.

296
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,467
I guess not!

297

Oh, no reason.

300
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:59,401
Do you know who his girlfriend is?

301
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,153
No, no idea.

302
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,558
Really! I really don't know!

303
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,109
Of course. He wouldn't hang with a girl like you.

304
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,680
Give me a break!

305
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,910

That was sudden.

334
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,979

...the money?

554
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:24,236
Neckties off.

555
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,050
That's right.

556
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,559
Great! Great, Reon. Okay.

557
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,040
Put your hands on Reon's shoulder. Yeah!

558
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,232
Okay.

559
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,694
Isn't his shirt too open?

560
00:40:38,694 --> 00:40:42,823
Get closer. Closer, closer, closer!

561
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:44,851
Now, pants off!

562
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:46,760
No damn way.

563
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,561
Just kidding.

564
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,808
Will we really get paid?

565
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:55,135
Generously.

566
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:56,853
By the way...

567
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:11,085
Are you going to college in America? This is an application, right?

568
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:17,400
So, you'll take over Uncle's business?

569
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,223
I don't want to. But, I feel like...

570
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:27,583
...I'm going nowhere.

571
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,104
That's humble of you.

572
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,602
I've got an attractive face and body, and I'm smart.

573
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:40,590
I'm good at sports, and everything else.

574
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,661
Even so... that's not enough to look after Aoi.

575
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,289
Money, huh?

576
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:54,244
Not just money. I need a goal. A purpose.

577
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,040
I don't know what that is yet, but I want to be

578
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,344
reliable and strong, for Aoi.

579
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,323
That's why you'll go to college in America?

580
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:10,085
But, don't tell anyone yet.

581
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,006
Reon, too.

582
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,675
And Aoi.

583
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:20,420
I'm flattered you've only told me.

584
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,749
Shu, the girls asked us out to dinner.

585
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:27,442
- Come on, Shusei-kun!
- Come on!

586
00:42:27,442 --> 00:42:29,840
I've got to work.

587
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,948
Not again.

588
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,983
I'll see you later.

589
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:40,432
You're like an old family man. Work this, work that. Have some fun!

590
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,318
My boss has big boobs.

591
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,213
For real? Introduce me!

592
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:47,363
See ya.

593
00:42:47,363 --> 00:42:49,766
Yeah. Thanks bro.

594
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,432
Shu's totally changed.

595
00:42:57,432 --> 00:43:02,521
Savoring meals that girl cooks, laughing happily...

596
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,899
What's his deal?

597
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:10,679
You know, don't you? About his childhood.

598
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:21,406
Dad was a workaholic. Mom got sick of it and left us.

599
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,520
Shu was always on his own.

600
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,227
The few times we ate together, he was so glad.

601
00:43:33,227 --> 00:43:37,038
We talked for hours and hours.

602
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,269
He doesn't know how a family's supposed to be.

603
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,867
That's why he's happy just eating together with Aoi-chan.

604
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,780
Playing house?

605
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,132
Hey, go easy on him.

606
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,739
Reon.

607
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:12,115
You take over your dad's business.

608
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,357
Shusei would look good in that...

609
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:47,367
No, he wouldn't.

610
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,237
Reon-kun!

611
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:52,472
Shu's color is black.

612
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,191
You're right.

613
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:57,593
Hey, come and shop with me.

614
00:44:57,593 --> 00:45:02,165
For a jacket. His birthday's next month.

615
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,707
Come on.

616
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,300
Welcome.

617
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,240
How about this?

618
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,942
Too flashy.

619
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:23,419
Okay...

620
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,931
It's got to be this!

621
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,018
Reon-kun, it suits you!

622
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:50,338
Cool. It's really cool!

623
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:52,391
Why all the compliments?

624
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,220
Are you trying to win me over?

625
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,366
I'm your enemy, so you are sucking up to me...

626
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:03,735
That's not why!

627
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,258
You're Shusei's cousin. You're family.

628
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:15,138
So, I want to get along with you. I'm trying to.

629
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,508
It's true!

630
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,582
What?

631
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:29,344
You want to get closer?

632
00:46:29,344 --> 00:46:33,272
I-I do, but... Sorry.

633
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,963
Don't!

634
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,260
You think I'm serious?

635
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,056
That's so funny! Should I tell Shu?

636
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:55,511
She's an easy girl who says she wants to get closer to me.

637
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:57,322
Ow! What the hell?!

638
00:46:57,322 --> 00:46:59,141
Are you enjoying this?

639
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,478
You enjoy hurting me?!

640
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,102
I was... glad...

641
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:15,024
Shu's brother is the only relative of him I know... so...

642
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,636
...I wanted to get to know you.

643
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,146

[No. 10 Apartments]

645
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,563
I'm home.

646
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,975
Quit gawking.

647
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,745
Where's Aoi?

648
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,175
Something happened?

649
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,201
What did you do?

650
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:42,518
I hate him so much! Dammit! He's so frustrating!

651
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,858
Aoi.

652
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,770
Shusei...

653
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,340
There's no need to get along with or get to know Reon.

654
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:13,800
Who cares if he doesn't accept you? I accept you. Isn't that enough?

655
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,554
It's not enough.

656
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:22,234
Reon's determined to take you back to America.

657
00:49:22,234 --> 00:49:26,871
He's out of control. He's a monster.

658
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:32,193
If he tooks you away from me, I couldn't bear it.

659
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,400
Can we stay like this a little longer?

660
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,120
Be my guest.

661
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,118
What's that for?

662
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,722
You smell nice.

I'm home.

666
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:43,166
Sorry about yesterday. I shouldn't have slapped you.

667
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,297
Here. Look.

668
00:51:49,297 --> 00:51:51,424
Let's make up.

669
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,113
Keep it!

670
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:00,116
- You don't like it?
- I like it, but...

671
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:03,236
Okay, eat it later.

672
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,449
Hey!

[Sorry]

674
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,391
Huh? Pudding?

675
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:29,337
Really? Wow! We're on the same wavelength!

676
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:32,321
No, we're not! I made that pudding!

677
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:36,411
Screw it, I'll eat yours! Happy now?

678
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,158
You know, I acted really childishly.

679
00:52:43,158 --> 00:52:46,154
I took your joke seriously.

680
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:52,643
No wonder you think I'm not fit to be Shusei's girlfriend.

681
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:57,072
Why are you apologizing? How can you smile about it?

682
00:52:57,072 --> 00:52:59,658
Sorry? What was that?

683
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,967
Why is Shu with a girl like you?! Why is he sacrificing himself...

684
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,587
I don't get it at all!

685
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,941
I'll have some.

00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,152
It's good!

687
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:32,908
I mean, why do I have to go to all this trouble?

688
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:36,996
Why am I eating pudding, dammit?

Hey. Do you mind if I ask you something?

693
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,590
What?

694
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,229
Why do you want to take Shu back so much?

695
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,253
For my dad's business.

696
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,567
- You should...
- I can't do it.

697
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:17,136
But... Shu could.

698
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,799
When we were in America,

699
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,301
he was like a big bro.

700
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:29,023
He could do anything, and teach me anything.

701
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:31,467
He was my hero.

702
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,290
You are such a chicken. Are you gonna run away again?

703
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:39,030
He can't help it. It's what a Kuga Group boy always does.

704
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,570
Come on, can you fight?

705
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,270
Yeah. You can ask your daddy some more.

706
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,450
No way!

00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,110

I'll get you for this.

713
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:14,878
He jumped down from so high. He said it was just instinct.

00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,635
- Shu!
- Reon!

00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:26,346
Let's shoot hoops.

716
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:37,942
I wanted to be like him. I did whatever he did.

717
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,917
But I failed.

718
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:50,997
Whatever I do, Shu's number one, and I'm always second.

719
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,451
That's not true.

720
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:01,557
I think you've got a better sense of cooking.

721
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,361
Your advice on flavor is precise,

722
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:09,590
and you fold clothes neatly. Oh, ironing too!

723
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,868
Shusei's hopeless at that.

724
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:15,021
But, those are women's jobs.

725
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:18,373
No, they're not! Anyway,

726
00:56:18,373 --> 00:56:23,012
forget about being first, or second. Don't rank yourself.

727
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:26,507
You've got strengths, too.

728
00:56:26,507 --> 00:56:30,878
Okay, tell me 100 of them.

729
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:37,192
First of all, you're more approachable than Shusei.

730
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:42,490
You sleep more soundly, and you're cute when you smile.

731
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:45,176
I'm a guy, don't call me cute.

732
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:48,955
You complain, but you always finish meals.

01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:02,476
Why not? Let's go.

915
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:06,120
We gotta make them believe it.

916
01:12:30,839 --> 01:12:34,441
Who'll be our best couple?

917
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:37,862
Here's our star couple!

918
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:39,847
Take part in our test!

919
01:12:39,847 --> 01:12:42,151
- No, thank you.
- Let's do it.

920
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:44,159
Huh? Why?!

921
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,660
How much do they love each other?

922
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,740
As much as one another?

923
01:12:49,748 --> 01:12:53,451
Compatibility test, start!

924
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,823
Question 1!

925
01:12:56,823 --> 01:13:02,444
To the girls. What's your guy's favorite food?

926
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,090
We have our star couple here.

927
01:13:09,827 --> 01:13:12,521
Okay, it looks like they're ready.

928
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:16,425
Both of you, show your flip cards!

929
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:20,403
[Egg]
[Raspberry]

930
01:13:20,403 --> 01:13:23,899
- Isn't it raspberry?
- Never said I liked it.

931
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,760
On to question 2!

932
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,064
What's his favorite phrase?

933
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:32,074
[I can't stand it]
[What a letdown]

934
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,586
Huh? You never say that!

935
01:13:36,587 --> 01:13:38,631
It's my favorite.

936
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:41,809
- What a letdown.
- You never said it!

937
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:44,095
Question 3!

938
01:13:44,095 --> 01:13:48,340
What animal does he resemble most?

939
01:13:55,023 --> 01:13:58,376
I think they know we're lying.

940
01:13:58,376 --> 01:14:01,420
Hey, why did you say owl!

941
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,441
I'm the king of beasts, the lion!

942
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:09,144
Huh? Aren't you a little too timid?

943
01:14:09,996 --> 01:14:13,480
I mean, not in a bad way.

944
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,977
You're unexpectedly observant,

945
01:14:16,977 --> 01:14:22,257
and surprisingly earnest, or should I say faithful.

946
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:27,161
You seem wild, but you're actually... levelheaded.

947
01:14:28,056 --> 01:14:29,965
That's not a compliment.

948
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,451
Sorry. I mean to say...

949
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:35,420
You see right through me.

950
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,176
You're probably right.

951
01:14:54,873 --> 01:14:57,851
Reon Kugayama of Year 2, Class B.

952
01:14:57,851 --> 01:15:01,900
Aoi Nishimori of Year 3, Class A.

953
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,890
Come to the main stage immediately.

954
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,487
Ladies and gentlemen!

955
01:15:08,487 --> 01:15:13,933
These two, who came last in our compatibility test,

956
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:18,897
need to get to know each other better, so...

957
01:15:18,897 --> 01:15:22,610
they'll have to make a pledge with a kiss!

958
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:32,300
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

959
01:15:32,303 --> 01:15:36,290
- Now what?
- We can't! You know we can't!

960
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,083
But, we have to.

961
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:40,402
No! We can't!

962
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:54,165
Hey p-p-p-panda! W-What's your problem?

963
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:24,563
I... don't understand...

964
01:16:24,563 --> 01:16:27,733
I thought I knew...

965
01:16:28,401 --> 01:16:31,219
what you were thinking.

966
01:16:33,197 --> 01:16:38,701
But, it turns out your thoughts are totally different from mine.

967
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,157
I'm sorry.

968
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:51,414
I should've talked to you about college in America, but...

969
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:55,793
I'm going because I want to be able to look after you.

970
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:05,870
How can you look after me if you're not with me?

971
01:17:07,173 --> 01:17:12,051
Not when I want to cry. Not when I need a hug...

972
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,879
Are we...

973
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:25,923

976
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,140
Dammit...

977
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,230
- Oh, no!
- Seriously?

978
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:22,164
What's all this for?

979
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:27,043
I've gotta take care of this because there's no room at your rabbit hutch.

980
01:18:27,044 --> 01:18:30,631
Let me help you. You can't do it alone.

981
01:18:30,631 --> 01:18:32,507
I can handle it.

982
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:36,020
Just let me do it.

983
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,098
Attention passengers. Due to heavy rain at Futamatagawa,

984
01:18:41,099 --> 01:18:46,521
service is suspended between Minamimakigahara and Shonandai.

985
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,346
Hello?

986
01:19:02,346 --> 01:19:08,860
Shu, it's me. The trains aren't running, so I came to my place.

987
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,854
She's with me.

988
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,349
Thanks.

989
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,595
Put Aoi on.

990
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,723
Shu wants to talk.

991
01:19:27,881 --> 01:19:32,550
Your place is near Hoshikawa Station, right?

992
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:35,340
I'm going there.

993
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:39,283
- You can't. The trains have stopped.
- By taxi.

994
01:19:39,283 --> 01:19:43,961
No way. I'll send her home when the trains restart.

995
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:58,968
Service is suspended on the Izumi Line due to a power outage,

996
01:19:58,969 --> 01:20:02,996
and is unlikely to resume today.

997
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:08,312
Unlikely to resume today? That means...

998
01:20:08,312 --> 01:20:10,663
You might be stuck.

999
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:13,891
What should I do?

1000
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,212
What should you do?

1001
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:22,268
- What else? Stay here.
- What?

1002
01:20:22,268 --> 01:20:25,454
What? Do you think I'm gonna jump you?

1003
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,739
No, but...

1004
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:32,093
Just get changed. You'll catch a cold. Use my clothes.

1005
01:20:46,324 --> 01:20:51,313
Your clothes are too big. Or am I too small?

1006
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:54,515
Is this American size?

1007
01:20:55,233 --> 01:20:56,984
Don't wear my clothes!

1008
01:20:56,985 --> 01:21:00,906
- But you...
- Take them off! No...

1009
01:21:01,449 --> 01:21:03,216
leave them on.

1010
01:21:05,285 --> 01:21:06,454
Want a drink?

1011
01:21:06,454 --> 01:21:08,805
I'm freezing.

1012
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:11,699

Nah, they're not difficult.

Don't lie, they're difficult.

1020
01:21:55,252 --> 01:21:59,714

Yes?

01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,809
Where's Aoi?

1027
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,988
Taking a bath.

1028
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,360

fluent in English, with big boobs.

01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,347
Why...

1090
01:28:34,751 --> 01:28:36,310
Aoi.

1091
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,331
I came for you.

1092
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:41,700
[Aoba High School Festival]

1093
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,540
Well done with the school festival.

1094
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:46,180
Good work.

1095
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,042
Today, we'll split into three groups,

1096
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:53,430
and tidy classrooms, the gymnasium, and main stage.

1097
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:57,010
Now, split into three male and female groups.

1098
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:59,380
Yes.

1099
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:15,468
I knew you'd be here.

1100
01:30:21,191 --> 01:30:22,220
What?

1101
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,110
What did you do?

1102
01:30:26,196 --> 01:30:28,898
Aoi hasn't spoken since yesterday.

1103
01:30:30,867 --> 01:30:33,777
She won't look at me.

1104
01:30:35,788 --> 01:30:38,231
She's not the same.

1105
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,966
Answer me!

1106
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:03,974
I kissed her.

1107
01:31:03,974 --> 01:31:06,110
Go on, hit me.

1108
01:31:08,655 --> 01:31:10,915
Don't mess with me!

1109
01:31:10,915 --> 01:31:16,069
You messed with me! You've got no right to hit me!

1110
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:18,272
Screw you!

1111
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:23,660
Don't touch Aoi! Don't act friendly!

1112
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:27,381
Don't talk to her! Don't breathe near her!

1113
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:29,883
Hey!

1114
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,690
Shu...

1115
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,830
you're a wimp.

1116
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,016
You're right.

1117
01:32:03,517 --> 01:32:05,819
I'm a wimp.

1118
01:32:07,046 --> 01:32:09,799
I'm no hero.

1119
01:32:20,252 --> 01:32:22,069
I'm scared.

1120
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:28,409
Since you came here, I've been a nervous wreck.

1121
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:42,507
Because you're my rival.

1122
01:32:46,378 --> 01:32:50,072
Like hell I am! I'm no rival!

1123
01:32:50,072 --> 01:32:52,967
I can't beat you.

1124
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:02,893
She only cares about you! Can't you see that?

1125
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:12,203
Shu, I...

1126
01:33:12,203 --> 01:33:14,888
...can't beat you at anything.

1127
01:33:16,141 --> 01:33:17,750
But...

1128
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,570
I'm gonna change that.

1129
01:33:22,205 --> 01:33:25,081
I'll take over the business!

1130
01:33:26,918 --> 01:33:32,514
I'll show my dad that I've got what it takes.

1131
01:33:32,514 --> 01:33:35,008
More than you.

1132
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:39,038
Reon...

1133
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:43,918
I won't run from him anymore.

1134
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:49,956
So, Shu, don't run from her either!

1135
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,500
Look, look!

1136
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,337
Kanae! Kanae! Did you see this group message?

1137
01:34:11,337 --> 01:34:13,239
What's this?! No way!

1138
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:17,409
- No way! Look at this!
- What? Oh my god!

1139
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:22,298
Holy crap! Check this out! I can't believe it!

1140
01:34:22,298 --> 01:34:24,457
Look!

1141
01:34:24,457 --> 01:34:25,667
Caught red-handed.

1142
01:34:25,668 --> 01:34:29,521
[Aoi Nishimori is a two-timer!]

1143
01:34:30,882 --> 01:34:34,143
[What a bitch!]
[Spread the word]

1144
01:34:34,143 --> 01:34:35,603
Shu...

1145
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:47,645
- Big news?
- What? What?

1146
01:34:49,376 --> 01:34:50,802
No way...

1147
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:53,712
What is this?

1148
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:56,999
What's wrong?

1149
01:34:56,999 --> 01:34:58,726
Well...

1150
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,101
[Big news! Aoi Nishimori is a two-timer!]

1151
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,050
How could she?

1152
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:16,609
That's so low!

1153
01:35:16,609 --> 01:35:18,345
Poor Shusei.

1154
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:20,113
How did she do it?

1155
01:35:20,113 --> 01:35:21,407
Hey...

1156
01:35:21,407 --> 01:35:24,977
Ryosuke... Where's Shusei-kun?

1157
01:35:24,977 --> 01:35:27,362
He left earlier and I haven't seen him since.

1158
01:35:27,362 --> 01:35:29,063
Oh...

1159
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:47,040
What's so good about a girl like you?

1160
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,741
You're a plain Jane.

1161
01:35:48,741 --> 01:35:52,829
And a two-timer. You make me sick.

1162
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:14,667
You got a problem with my girl?

1163
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:17,170
Shusei...

1164
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:19,870
Shusei...

1165
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:40,752
You dumbasses got it all wrong!

1166
01:36:41,446 --> 01:36:47,300
Aoi Nishimori and I were never together! As if we would be!

1167
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:51,529
Hey, did you hear me?

1168
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:55,818
Listen up!

1169
01:36:56,419 --> 01:37:00,872
Aoi Nishimori and I were never together!

1170
01:37:02,133 --> 01:37:04,969
So, she's not a two-timer!

1171
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:10,780
As if I'd date a girl like her!

1172
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:13,300
Don't fall for that bullcrap!

1173
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:17,698
So... Shusei-kun's girlfriend really is...

1174
01:37:17,698 --> 01:37:18,631
No way!

1175
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:22,844
Aoi Nishimori's real boyfriend is...

1176
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:28,951
...Shu! Kugayama Shusei!

1177
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:33,346
I couldn't believe it, either!

1178
01:37:33,346 --> 01:37:38,819
Why would he fall for an average big boob-less girl like that?

1179
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:40,854
My type of girl has

1180
01:37:40,854 --> 01:37:46,659
smarts and strength, wits and beauty, height, and big boobs!

1181
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:47,969
Reon-kun!

1182
01:37:47,969 --> 01:37:49,455
However!

1183
01:37:49,455 --> 01:37:51,899
Now I understand.

1184
01:37:54,544 --> 01:37:59,672
Aoi Nishimori... is always dedicated!

1185
01:37:59,672 --> 01:38:03,569
Honest. Sincere.

1186
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:07,481
Principled!

1187
01:38:09,033 --> 01:38:10,842
And...

1188
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:17,666
Dammit, she's 100 out of 100!

1189
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:21,462
Reon-kun...

1190
01:38:24,523 --> 01:38:27,240
You got that, dumbasses?

1191
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,070
These two are a real couple!

1192
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:37,969
The end! Thank you for listening!

1193
01:38:41,591 --> 01:38:44,819
- I can't believe it!
- Shusei-kun has a girl?!

1194
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:46,845
Shusei-kun, why...

1195
01:38:46,845 --> 01:38:49,423
Why'd he hide it?

1196
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:52,025
Aoi!

1197
01:39:02,629 --> 01:39:08,508
I've never cared about anyone... this much before.

1198
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:13,379
Shusei...

1199
01:39:13,379 --> 01:39:15,148
Aoi!

1200
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:20,203
I love you!

1201
01:39:26,553 --> 01:39:29,963
You said you didn't understand me...

1202
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:33,500
...but you should know that.

1203
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:42,643
I...

1204
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:48,381
...want to be with you forever.

1205
01:39:49,408 --> 01:39:51,577
I do, too...

1206
01:39:53,887 --> 01:39:57,240
I don't want us to be apart!

1207
01:40:11,004 --> 01:40:13,599
I was sure about going to America...

1208
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:18,245
...but I'm not sure anymore.

1209
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:22,558
One thing I know for sure.

1210
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:30,566
Being apart from you is something I can't do.
