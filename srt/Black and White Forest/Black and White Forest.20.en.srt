7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,260
What took Ms. Wen so long?

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,140
Are you an idiot?

9
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,330
She went to the subway station
to pick up her boyfriend.

10
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,790
Her boyfriend?

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,620
He's either rich or powerful.

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,770
Why would he take the subway?

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,750
You're so ignorant.

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,450
Zixuan's boyfriend

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,080
is from a family of farmers.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,380
He's extremely poor.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,010
He helped her

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,500
carry her luggage on the train,

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,920
and Zixuan fell in love with him.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,020
Otherwise, why would a rich heiress

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,840
choose a poor man?

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,020
You don't know her at all.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,550
Zixuan was born

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,660
to be a unique and reckless girl.

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,100
However, I think this man

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,340
is just her friend.

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,800
She won't be happy with him.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,640
Exactly.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,070
By the way,

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,520
what did you prepare for her birthday?

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,850
Speaking of which,

32
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,150
I bought a 900-yuan scarf,

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,180
but it turns out the other gifts

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,660
are worth at least 1000 yuan.

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,840
Mine must be the cheapest one.

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,580
Don't worry.

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,420
Zixuan

38
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,340
doesn't care about the price.

39
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Gift List)
She cares about

40
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,860
the meaning

41
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,180
behind it.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,780
You know what's going on with Bao.

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,460
Just tell me the truth.

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,720
Will he be alright?

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,340
Don't make up a story.

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm only in charge of business.

53
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,920
I don't know about

54
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,820
other things.

Bin.

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,760
Listen...

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,860
I don't understand.

59
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,660
You arrested

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,980
and then released him.

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,860
Now you're saying he hired a killer.

62
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,260
Why did you let him go?

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,480
Listen to me.

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,940
Look,

65
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,140
it's not as simple as you think.

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,780
I'm thinking too simply?

67
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,170
Then tell me how complicated it is.

68
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,250
I...

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,820
Let me ask you.

70
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,220
Did you call Mr. Xing?

71
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,980
Yes, but his phone is off.

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,660
He's always doing this.

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,820
What do you mean?

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,180
I've told you

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,740
it's not that simple.

76
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,380
Xing Liang is under interrogation,

77
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,380
and Bao was arrested.

78
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,100
How are these two things connected?

79
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,740
Oh, no. How can they be related?

80
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,140
Don't ask. It'll only make it worse.

81
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,210
Thanks.

82
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,130
The number you dialed is off...

83
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,620
It's really off.

84
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,740
Thanks.

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,440
Actually,

86
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,340
from what I know about Bao,

87
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,900
even if he's involved

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,140
in the murder,

89
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,580
he can't be a direct participant.

90
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,870
Ms. Wen,

91
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,340
don't worry.

92
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,250
Binbin.

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
Binbin.

94
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,850
Sister.

95
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,370
Did you call him?

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,800
He didn't answer.

97
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,020
What's going on?

98
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,340
They don't know.

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,850
They took Bao back

100
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,520
for investigation.

101
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Well...

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
What's wrong?

103
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,950
What does that mean?

104
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,180
I think Liang is having a meeting,

105
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,280
so he missed your call.

106
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
At this point,

107
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,440
I don't think he has time...

108
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,400
His phone is off.

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
He can't answer any calls.

110
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,080
Just tell me what happened.

111
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,750
Hurry. Otherwise, I'll ask the police.

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,770
What are you waiting for?

113
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,920
Just tell us what happened.

114
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,400
I think Liang is also
under investigation.

115
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,720
Investigation?

116
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,440
Is it related to Bao's case?

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,830
I'm not sure.

118
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,020
Sister, don't worry.

119
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,700
I'll figure it out.

120
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,720
I can't believe it.

121
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,840
They have a plan.

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,600
They're starting to take people down.

123
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,440
If Liang was fine,

124
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Bao might be in danger.

125
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,520
But Liang was taken away,

126
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,880
so Bao will be fine.

127
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,650
Your logic is correct,

128
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,640
and they understand it too.

129
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,480
But I'm still worried.

130
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
Well, what if...

131
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,880
Just in case.

132
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,030
If Bao is really guilty,

133
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,760
Liang won't get away with it.

134
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,690
Bao...

135
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,150
No matter what,

136
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,600
their ultimate goal

137
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,670
must be Tuan Island.

138
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,900
If the accusation against Bao is true,

139
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,220
Dian Lao'er's shares

140
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,480
will become the focus again,

141
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,680
and Qi Hanchen

142
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,000
will benefit from it.

143
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,500
- Can you get in touch with Haicheng?
- Yes.

144
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,840
But I think

145
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,280
they'll ask for much at this point.

146
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,030
They only want money,

147
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,360
but Qi Hanchen wants our lives.

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,320
Okay, I'll call them.

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
By the way,

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,240
Qi Hanchen has planned this
for a long time.

151
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
He'll spread bad rumors

152
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,540
about Tuan Island.

153
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,160
I've been there.

154
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
Leave it to me.

155
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,000
You have more important things to do.

156
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,880
We don't have time.

157
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,000
We need to split up.

158
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,460
(MorningStar Group)

159
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,840
A report can also

160
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,000
make a difference.

161
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,360
As a unit chief,

162
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
he can't be completely innocent.

163
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,580
According to our source,

164
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
apart from the report letter,

165
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,180
there's another reason

166
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,200
why he's being investigated.

167
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
The shooter

168
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,000
accused Bao Chenyan of hiring a killer.

169
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,080
Xing Liang knew it

170
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,160
but released him.

171
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,600
He violated regulations.

172
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
Hiring a killer?

173
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Who arranged it?

174
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
Uncle Long.

175
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,440
Bao Chenyan was accused of
hiring a killer.

176
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,920
Did your friend do it?

177
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,360
It's the skill of tightening the net.

178
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,680
I'm so impressed.

179
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,920
I'd like to invite your friend

180
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,620
to Guanhai Tea House

181
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,280
to exchange fishing tips in two days.

182
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
Is he available?

183
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,160
Okay, I'll tell him.

184
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,780
This man is very greedy.

185
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
It's not just Tuan Island.

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,040
In my opinion,

187
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,140
he not only wants to

188
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,500
get rid of Bao Chenyan for good

189
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,600
but also wants to set up Xing Liang.

190
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,320
He's cunning

191
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,080
and cruel.

192
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,700
We must be careful

193
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,240
when dealing with him.

194
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,040
Mr. Qi,

195
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,920
is it too dangerous for you

196
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,580
to meet with someone like him?

197
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm doing this because

198
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
I want to know what he's got.

199
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,640
Like I said,

200
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,680
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

201
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,840
He's dealing with

202
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Bao Chenyan and Xing Liang,

203
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
and it's good

204
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,440
for us.

205
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,680
Talk to Mr. Wang

206
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,160
and apply for

207
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,640
an administrative review.

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Just tell them

209
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,040
Bao Chenyan is suspected of
hiring a killer

210
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,960
and unjust enrichment.

211
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
Okay.

212
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,380
(Binjiang Criminal Police Unit)

213
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,010
Where are you going?

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
Can't you just stop?

215
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,320
Binbin, listen.

216
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,600
Stop asking.

217
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,410
You got me wrong.

218
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,040
My sister wanted to know.

219
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,520
Do you want to deal with her?

220
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,360
Fine, I'm leaving.

221
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,620
I'll send her the address

222
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,480
and let her come.

223
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
Stop.

224
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,680
If I knew you'd wait for me,

225
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,360
I'd rather stay at the DIC.

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Listen,

227
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,400
why is Bao Chenyan's murder accusation

228
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,060
related to Xing Liang?

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,600
Before Bao Chenyan was released,

230
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,860
(Binjiang CPB)
Chen Yiming

231
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,240
had made clear accusations.

232
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,080
As the person in charge,

233
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,520
why did you release him

234
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,040
before solving the case?

235
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,150
Yes,

236
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,360
Chen Yiming

237
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,520
made accusations against Bao Chenyan.

238
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
However,

239
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,920
none of them

240
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,680
can be used

241
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,330
as solid evidence.

242
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,080
In such circumstances,

243
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,520
I had no reason

244
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,200
to extend Bao Chenyan's detention.

245
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,040
After all,

246
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,360
he was arrested for fighting,

247
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
a security incident,

248
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,240
instead of a criminal case.

249
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,080
After being released,

250
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,120
he went to the hearing

251
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,420
regarding to

252
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,790
the share transfer agreement
between Wen Group

253
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,000
and Benniu Group.

254
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
As far as we know,

255
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,120
the actual controller
of Wen's Tuan Island Trading Co., Ltd.

256
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,280
is Bao Chenyan,

257
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,640
and your wife

258
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,600
Wen Zixuan

259
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,590
is the investor.

260
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,880
Did you release Bao Chenyan

261
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,160
at this point

262
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,600
to protect Tuan Island Trading's

263
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,220
business interest?

264
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,920
No.

265
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,660
If he'd done it before,

266
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,550
my sister would've been a billionaire.

267
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,880
Why would she work so hard?

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,280
At this critical moment,

269
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,240
no one cares about the process

270
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,680
but the result.

271
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
They set us up

272
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
for Tuan Island.

273
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,760
They want to get all of us
into this mess.

274
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,200
It's not just a trap.

275
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,120
They want to take care of

276
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,000
Mr. Xing for good.

277
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
What do you mean?

278
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,280
Do you know Li Xiangyuan?

279
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,370
Yes.

280
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,300
What's your relationship?

281
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,020
We were classmates in middle school.

282
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,690
Did you help him solve

283
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,740
a public security issue?

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,840
Yes.

285
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,800
It was

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,720
a labor dispute.

287
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Some people

288
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,830
broke into their company

289
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,840
and smashed their office.

290
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,160
He called the police.

291
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,240
However,

292
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,660
this case was taken over

293
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,900
by the police station

294
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,830
in that district.

295
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,280
There are police records

296
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,760
and case files.

297
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,600
Is there any exchange of benefits

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,080
in handling this?

299
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,560
What exchange

300
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,560
of interests?

301
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,000
Xing Jian filed a real-name report.

302
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,800
He said Li Xiangyuan
would pay off his debt,

303
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,870
(Report Letter)
but you

304
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,010
needed to help Li Xiangyuan

305
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,280
solve his problems.

306
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,040
It was a money-power deal.

307
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,680
- Water.
- Thanks.

308
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,640
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

309
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

310
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,280
Cousin,

311
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,560
I really need a bridge loan

312
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,080
to save

313
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,800
my factory.

314
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,200
Otherwise,

315
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
I'll have to run away.

316
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
Xing Jian.

317
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,600
Your cousin

318
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,240
is just a police officer.

319
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,580
He's not that powerful.

320
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,960
You don't know him.

321
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,270
He'd do anything to help

322
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,240
his family,

323
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,360
but this is beyond his ability.

324
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
You're making it hard for him.

325
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,000
Didn't you ask him to borrow

326
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
some money from me?

327
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,460
He didn't tell you that he knew

328
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,200
my company was in trouble,

329
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
and he didn't tell me about it.

330
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,770
He gave you

331
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,760
all his

332
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,920
private savings.

333
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,180
Oh, no.

334
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,880
You got me wrong.

335
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,230
I don't want to borrow money.

336
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,400
My cousin knows many people, right?

337
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,700
Can he introduce me to them?

338
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,590
I'll pay all the interest.

339
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,600
Trust me.

340
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,400
Have some water.

341
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
I'll get the door.

342
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,100
- Have some water.
- Okay.

343
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,680
Xing Jian.

344
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,120
He doesn't know

345
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,880
- any businessman.
- You're here.

346
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,480
He has to stay away from them.

347
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Think about it.

348
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,680
If he was close to these people,

349
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,720
- he'd be in trouble.
- That's right.

350
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,120
Come on.

351
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,210
I didn't think it through.

352
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,670
I just had a business dinner.

353
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,460
I know. You smell like alcohol.

354
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,330
You drank a lot.

355
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,950
- Xiangyuan.
- Hello.

356
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,380
Let me introduce him.

357
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,320
This is my cousin Xing Jian.

358
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,440
This is my old classmate Li Xiangyuan.

359
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,750
His cousin, right?

360
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,020
Nice to meet you.

361
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,860
Hello, Mr. Li.

362
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,640
Have a seat.

363
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,720
I drank a lot.

364
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,180
Last time, Mr. Qi and Mr. Tai
were with us,

365
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,420
and we were drunk,

366
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,730
so I forgot this.

367
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
Xiangyuan,

368
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,260
do you want me

369
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,430
to throw you out with this?

370
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,440
Don't do this again, okay?

371
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,180
Okay.

372
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,480
Then

373
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,960
I'll report my mom.

374
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,640
She found out

375
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,330
you haven't come home for years,

376
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,080
so she prepared

377
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,740
some specialty gifts to corrupt you.

378
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,960
Well...

379
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,330
Let's take a look.

380
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
- Your favorite dried fish.
- Dried fish.

381
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,960
- Go back and apologize to her.
- Two bags.

382
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,280
- Thanks.
- Coffee.

383
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,120
Thanks, Zixuan.

384
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,840
Okay.

385
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,960
Thank you so much. Enough.

386
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I got it, okay?

387
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,080
- I'll take it.
- Mr. Li.

388
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,920
Mr. Li.

389
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
Well, cousin, Zixuan,

390
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,670
you guys talk.

391
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,670
I have work to do.

392
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,760
Hey, you can stay.

393
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,640
I should go.

394
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,000
Walk him...

395
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,440
Hello, Mr. Li.

396
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,730
- Hello, hello.
- Okay.

397
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,040
- I'll walk him out.
- Goodbye.

398
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,480
- Sit down.
- Okay.

399
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,630
Cousin, don't forget

400
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,560
- about me.
- Okay.

401
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
- Just go back.
- It's okay.

402
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,760
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

403
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,780
(Reporter: Xing Jian)

404
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,990
Since I became

405
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,970
a police officer,

406
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,620
I've never protected

407
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,180
anyone

408
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,600
or abused

409
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
my power

410
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,840
to exchange interests

411
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,660
with anyone.

412
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,390
We're still working on

413
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,590
the details.

414
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,080
That's enough for today.

415
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,830
Hello, Xuan.

416
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,230
Mr. Tai,

417
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,660
sorry to bother you.

418
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,840
Don't be so polite.

419
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,130
Listen,

420
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,920
don't worry about

421
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,800
Xing Liang.

422
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,430
I'm trying to figure it out.

423
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,760
I'll tell you if I find anything.

424
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,320
I just want to know

425
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,120
if he committed a crime.

426
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,480
Please trust the police

427
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,040
and Xing.

428
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,240
However, it's a little complicated.

429
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,640
After all, it's a real-name report.

430
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,150
Our leaders want to know the truth.

431
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,750
Who's trying to set him up?

432
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,570
I'm not sure.

433
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,130
Just

434
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,240
take care of

435
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,360
yourself,

436
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,610
okay?

437
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,740
As for Liang,

438
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,320
just remember,

439
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,200
a clean hand wants no washing.

440
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,900
Thanks.

441
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,970
You're welcome.

442
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,380
Okay. Bye.

443
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,170
You usually don't want to see him.

444
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,640
Why are you missing him now?

445
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,330
You usually don't want to see me.

446
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,230
Why are you caring about me now?

447
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,480
You're sad.

448
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,240
He's not always

449
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,510
a likable person,

450
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,860
but he's our family.

451
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,650
We're used to it.

452
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,290
He's never

453
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,260
a likable person, isn't he?

454
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,180
He only cares about his career.

455
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,710
However, with all the accusations

456
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,540
against him,

457
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,820
he must be so sad.

458
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,460
So, I have to help him.

459
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,140
Are you going to

460
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,740
fight against Qi Hanchen?

461
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,300
Do you know

462
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,940
why I didn't choose him?

463
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,780
Why?

464
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,100
Because he didn't deserve it.

465
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,210
Xuan.

466
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,450
I never thought

467
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,360
I'd have

468
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,750
the honor of

469
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,260
drinking your tea.

470
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,340
Things change.

471
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,540
I didn't know

472
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,380
you liked tea.

473
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,380
I only remember

474
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,540
Uncle Qi is a tea expert.

475
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,130
He talked about tea a lot

476
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,820
when our families gathered together,

477
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,350
so I developed this habit.

478
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,990
He's kind of my mentor.

479
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,310
Exactly.

480
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,000
My father is very

481
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,110
interested in tea.

482
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,980
He used to be busy all the time.

483
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,490
After the retirement,

484
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,810
he became obsessed with tea

485
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,980
and made many tea friends.

486
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,500
He doesn't care about

487
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,620
the group at all.

488
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm fully in charge.

489
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,330
Therefore,

490
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,620
I have to make decisions

491
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,540
for everything.

492
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,220
I'm so tired.

493
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,460
You say you're tired,

494
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,660
but

495
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,180
you enjoy it so much, right?

496
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,940
I have to admit it's interesting.

497
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,660
As an old friend,
I want to give you a heads-up.

498
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,300
Don't

499
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,860
overdo anything.

500
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,060
Otherwise,

501
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,430
it won't be

502
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,930
interesting anymore.

503
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,210
I've been told

504
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,120
that once you have a goal,

505
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,880
you have to reach it,

506
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,320
whatever it takes.

507
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,640
It's good to be persistent.

508
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,850
But if you're too persistent,

509
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,520
it'll become an obsession.

510
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,760
As the saying goes,

511
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,110
the greedier,

512
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,610
the more obsessed,

513
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,890
and the more miserable.

514
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,290
As a businessman,

515
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,230
you can't be too greedy or obsessed.

516
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,800
Ms. Wen, you have a point.

517
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,180
But you should worry about yourself.

518
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,520
When I had a meal with Xing,

519
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,640
I told him not to be

520
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,470
too obsessed with work

521
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,570
but care about his family

522
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,790
and rest well.

523
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,680
Look what has happened.

524
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,360
It seems he didn't listen to me.

525
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,480
So, you taught him

526
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
how to rest well,

527
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,560
didn't you?

528
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,760
We're friends.

529
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,550
It's not a big deal.

530
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,040
How long will the lesson last?

531
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,080
Do I need to pay for this?

532
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,930
We're old friends.

533
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,800
You know what I want.

534
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,400
You don't need to ask.

535
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,900
You want me to give you
Tuan Island for free?

536
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,560
You lost the game.

537
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,640
You have no choice.

538
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,190
You're confident.

539
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,000
But I'm afraid

540
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,580
someone won't like it.

541
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,730
Qi Hanchen,

542
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,310
you'd better know your place.

543
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,640
- Stop laughing. I...
- Tianyi!

544
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,600
What are you doing?

545
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,680
Get out!

546
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,200
They're kids.

547
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,130
Please don't mind.

548
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,920
Ms. Wen,

549
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,370
I have a meeting tonight.

550
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,080
- Goodbye.
- No rush.

551
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,440
We haven't finished.

552
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,820
Anything else?

553
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
Okay, talk to him.

554
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,600
Dad.

555
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,000
Listen,

556
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,840
stay out of Xuan's business.

557
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,610
Dad.

558
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,660
I've tried so hard

559
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,380
for this project.

560
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,270
I'm so close to success.

561
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,110
I...

562
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,080
You must play fair,

563
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,550
especially for Tuan Island.

564
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,200
How could you

565
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,100
play dirty like this?

566
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,160
From now on,

567
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,840
you'll stay out of it.

568
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,120
Okay.

569
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,760
I got it.

570
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,560
Ms. Wen, I'm impressed.

571
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,560
Can you tell me

572
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,000
how you persuaded him?

573
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,440
Mr. Qi still cares about our friendship.

574
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,560
I will listen to my father.

575
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,040
However, listen carefully,

576
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,300
since I took over

577
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,740
my family business,

578
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,280
I've been the only person in charge.

579
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,520
You're a successful man.

580
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
You must know

581
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,340
peace brings fortune.

582
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,880
Instead of wasting time and energy

583
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,040
on a lose-lose competition,

584
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,280
why don't we take a step back?

585
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,520
We can collaborate

586
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,250
on the Tuan Island project.

587
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,980
You're smarter than me.

588
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,960
What about Xing?

589
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,720
I will step away from it.

590
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,870
As for the rest, you're on your own.

591
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,960
One more thing.

592
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,920
The person who stabs you in the back

593
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,560
might be someone you trust.

594
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,250
Sister.

595
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,890
What did he say?

596
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,960
The person set him up

597
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,040
might be someone close to him.

598
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,320
Who can it be?

599
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,920
Close to him?

600
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,450
Except for his colleagues,

601
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,800
there are only

602
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,440
a few old classmates.

603
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
Colleagues...

604
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,470
It can't be his classmates.

605
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,320
They're good friends.

606
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,530
Besides, they have

607
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,000
no reason to frame him.

608
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,720
Sister, think about it.

609
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,080
Is there anyone

610
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,840
who knows Qi Hanchen

611
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,640
or needs his help?

612
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,040
Let me think.

613
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,240
I remember

614
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,440
Xing met Qi Hanchen

615
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
during a meal.

616
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,680
Li Xiangyuan invited them.

617
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,640
Li Xiangyuan?

618
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,880
The businessman?

619
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,080
He's Xing's

620
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,660
closest classmate.

621
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,920
Sister,

622
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
why don't we call him?

623
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,880
The number you dialed is powered off,

624
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,330
please...

625
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,080
I can't get through.

626
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,560
Mr. Li,

627
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,120
I've booked the earliest flight.

628
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,960
You can still catch it.

629
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,090
If someone asks, tell them

630
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,120
you don't know.

631
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,580
My phone is off.

632
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Send me emails.

633
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,560
Okay, got it.

634
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,480
Don't move, stop.

635
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm calling the police.

636
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,980
What are you doing?

637
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,760
Call them.

638
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,360
They're looking for you.

639
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,400
Did you write the report letter?

640
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,820
No, it was Xing Jian.

641
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,080
Stop lying to me.

642
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,680
Xing Jian told them

643
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,160
it was your order.

644
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,180
What? He's a rascal!

645
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,380
Why would I do that?

646
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,040
He's

647
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,500
slandering me, okay?

648
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,680
He's blaming it on me!

649
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,360
If it's really that simple,

650
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,160
just tell the police.

651
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Bin, listen,

652
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,990
I promised someone

653
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,040
I won't call the police.

654
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,880
I can't break the rules.

655
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,320
Mr. Qi?

656
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,680
Think about it.

657
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,840
How did we manage to find you

658
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,440
so quickly?

659
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,160
Do you mean...?

660
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,640
If you go to another city,

661
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,120
the police won't find you.

662
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,720
But it means

663
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,360
you'll be the scapegoat.

664
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,530
How long can you hide?

665
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,120
One year,

666
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,400
two years,

667
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,050
or forever?

668
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,560
What do you want?

669
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,660
Keep your phone off and leave.

670
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,440
Just do what Mr. Qi told you.

671
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,670
Don't provoke him.

672
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,820
We'll take care

673
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,640
of the police.

674
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,420
When you're back,

675
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,760
this will be over.

676
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,440
That's it?

677
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,560
Of course not.

678
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,440
Help us find Xing Jian.

679
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,790
I've told you he's a rascal!

680
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,870
He must've taken

681
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,820
Mr. Qi's money.

682
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,740
He won't tell them the truth!

683
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,290
Bao Chenyan.

684
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,560
It's not your first time here.

685
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,920
You know the rules.

686
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,450
I want to see Xing Liang.

687
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,840
He's not available.

688
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,850
You can't see him.

689
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,240
I don't know anything.

690
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,320
Bao Chenyan,
I'm saying this one last time.

691
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,020
Mr. Xing is not available,

692
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,190
understand?

693
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,640
Ask me.

694
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,810
Chen Yiming said

695
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,960
you told him to steal

696
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,920
Wen Binbin's gun.

697
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,180
Nonsense!

698
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,550
Everyone knows I'm loyal to Mr. Wen.

699
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,030
When Binbin was suspended

700
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,920
for losing the gun,

701
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,260
I worried about him the most.

702
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,960
Besides,

703
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,680
it's a police gun!

704
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,910
Are you idiots?

705
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,600
Why would I hurt Binbin?

706
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,080
Stop yelling.

707
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,050
Chen Yiming said

708
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,700
you ordered him to kill

709
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,870
Chen Mingyuan and Wu Ajin.

710
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,400
Officers,

711
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,900
I really hope

712
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,440
you can use your brain.

713
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,520
I fought with Dian Lao'er
for almost 20 years.

714
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,160
It was a fair game.

715
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,450
If I'd wanted to play dirty,

716
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,360
he would've died a million times,

717
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,440
right?

718
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,010
Besides, I was also

719
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,640
looking for Ajin.

720
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,080
Death is too easy

721
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
for him.

722
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,080
He hasn't paid his price.

723
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Please calm down.

724
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,500
Look,

725
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,740
do you know Luo Jiahui?

726
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,770
Who?

727
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,020
Look at this.

728
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
I only have Tao.

729
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,160
No other women.

730
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,760
Luo Jiahui

731
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,320
is Chen Yiming's mistress.

732
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,860
You don't know her?

733
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,610
He's my bro.

734
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,280
We've always trusted

735
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,450
each other,

736
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,160
okay?

737
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,720
I've never asked about
his personal life,

738
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,200
understand?

739
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,780
Who are you looking for?

740
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,950
Well,

741
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,200
I'm Xing Liang's brother-in-law.

742
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,440
He's been busy.

743
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,680
So, he sent me here.

744
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,800
He said

745
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,160
you needed help.

746
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
You're Zixuan's brother, right?

747
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,960
Yes, she's my sister.

748
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,640
Luo, give her the stuff.

749
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,730
Okay, Bin.

750
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,280
You don't have to

751
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,540
bring these fruits.

752
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,200
I'll put it here.

753
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,780
- Come on. Have some water.
- Okay.

754
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,240
You're so polite.

755
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,160
It's a lot.

756
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,780
Hey, come in.

757
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,620
Have a seat.

758
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,510
Suit yourself.

759
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,680
I'll get some water.

760
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,500
Where's Xing Jian?

761
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,760
I haven't seen him for a few days.

762
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,640
He must be messing around.

763
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,130
Li...

764
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,240
Do we have a guest?

765
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,720
Oh, this is Zixuan's brother.

766
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,900
Hi, it's you.

767
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,040
Come on. Have a seat.

768
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,570
Come on. Have a seat.

769
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,160
Is everything okay?

770
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,000
We're fine.

771
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,720
I knew it.

772
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,560
My brother is so lucky.

773
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,480
He has a good wife,

774
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,640
and he often

775
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,200
sends us money and gifts.

776
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,490
Bro,

777
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,880
you should also check my house.

778
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,320
Liang only told me

779
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,600
Xing Jian needed help,

780
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,040
so I...

781
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,700
My old house

782
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,970
collapsed many years ago.

783
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,300
I haven't repaired it,

784
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,630
and I don't have a job.

785
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,160
I'll go back and tell him.

786
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,400
I'm leaving.

787
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Sit down.

788
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,910
No rush.

789
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,640
Have some water.

790
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,560
Come on.

791
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,260
Actually,

792
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,360
I came here

793
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,280
with a mission.

794
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,000
Tell me.

795
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,600
My sister's company

796
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,590
needs some guards.

797
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,000
Liang said

798
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,410
family is more reliable.

799
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,580
He's been busy,

800
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,900
so he asked me to tell you this.

801
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,950
It's good news.

802
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,640
Well,

803
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,400
how's the salary?

804
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,920
Any insurance?

805
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,120
Keep the goodies within the family.

806
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,210
My sister is always
generous with her family.

807
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,000
Six thousand yuan

808
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,950
a month

809
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,530
will full insurance.

810
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,800
It's a lot.

811
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,290
No vacation,

812
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,700
but there's overtime pay.

813
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,040
What do you think of me?

814
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,660
Well, I don't deserve it?

815
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,500
No.

816
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,570
Liang said

817
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,760
Xing Jian is closer to his family.

818
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,240
Liang wants him to handle this.

819
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,960
We're family. What's the difference?

820
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,910
Because we're family,

821
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,840
I have to listen to him.

822
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,130
He really favors Xing Jian.

823
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,740
Li,

824
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,040
ask him over.

825
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,040
I haven't seen him for a few days.

826
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,540
What are you talking about?

827
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,420
I saw him go out yesterday.

828
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,280
Oh, you want

829
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,960
your brother to get this job?

830
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,380
Well, like he said,

831
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,920
they only hire the Xings.

832
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,640
Come on. Call him.

833
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,100
- Tell him there's good news.
- Fine.

834
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,120
Hello.

835
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,530
Come back.

836
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,240
Ye wants to tell you something.

837
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,400
Hurry up.

838
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,480
I'm waiting for you.

839
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,050
Bro.

840
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,430
Well...

841
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,080
One more thing.

842
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,660
I have

843
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,820
a brother

844
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,260
who learned free combat.

845
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
He's good.

846
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,040
He's also a Xing.

847
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,050
Can you let him

848
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,090
work for you?

849
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,120
Why did you run?

850
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,640
They have good news.

851
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,880
What are you doing?

852
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,920
Let me talk to him.

853
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,640
- See you later.
- Okay.

854
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,480
Brother.

855
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,530
It's okay.

856
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,540
We're family.

857
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,920
I'll make it clear.

858
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,560
Why did you report him?

859
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,720
Report what?

860
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,600
I don't know.

861
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,440
I told them

862
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,160
my sister's company needs guards,

863
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,480
and you'll be in charge.

864
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,560
If I tell them

865
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,960
you reported Xing Liang

866
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,560
and said bad things about them,

867
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,560
what will they do?

868
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,580
It's okay. I have a lot of time.

869
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,860
But I don't know about him.

870
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,820
Wait. Wait.

871
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,440
I'll tell you.

872
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,360
Mr. Li

873
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,680
introduced me to a man

874
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,480
called Director An.

875
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't know

876
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,400
his name.

877
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,720
He paid me 500 thousand yuan

878
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,990
to write a letter.

879
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,150
Is everything in this letter true?

880
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,950
Of course not.

881
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,080
If he'd done that,

882
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,970
all of us would've been rich.

883
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
His relatives

884
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,480
are so interesting.

885
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,840
You want to use my sister

886
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,560
and send her husband to jail.

887
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,960
She told me to stay away from you.

888
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,680
She was right.

889
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,740
You're so shameless.

890
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,390
Let's go.

891
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,790
Where?

892
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,840
It's not safe here.

893
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,690
He said you'd get the job.

894
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,360
He'll show me around.

895
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,470
Wait for my call.

896
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,080
Okay. Thank you so much.

897
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,360
When are you coming home?

898
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,810
It's okay.

899
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,560
He paid me

900
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
500 thousand yuan

901
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,320
to write a letter.

902
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,240
Is everything in this letter true?

903
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,170
Of course not.

904
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,420
(Binbin)

905
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,480
Fei Zai,

906
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,360
I'm heading back.

907
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,530
Talk to them.

908
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,160
We'll send the video to the DIC later.

909
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,000
Great.

910
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,600
Mr. Xing is innocent.

911
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,080
What's so special about this place?

912
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,400
We've been here many times.

913
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,640
There's a lot of work to do.

914
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,440
You've been complaining.

915
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,020
We're here now. Just enjoy the trip.

916
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,010
I'll buy a bag for you.

917
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
Okay. Get a taxi.

918
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,240
Wait for me.

919
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,560
Come on. Take it.

920
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,990
- Hurry.
- Okay, just go.

921
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,070
Hurry.

922
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,920
Hello, Mr. Qi.

923
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,280
Look,

924
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,960
I had no choice.

925
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,200
Xing Liang's

926
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,120
brother-in-law

927
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,640
was so nasty. I...

928
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,800
I couldn't handle it.

929
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,120
Don't worry.

930
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,080
I'll take all the blame.

931
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,800
You'll be fine.

932
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,700
I promise.

933
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,320
Okay, I got it.

934
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,560
Mr. Li, it's okay.

935
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,720
It's not your fault.

936
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,960
Don't worry, I will cooperate with you

937
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,160
as I promised.

938
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,920
Thanks, Mr. Qi.

939
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,520
Keep an eye on Bin.

940
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,950
Find out his next move.

941
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,720
Boss,

942
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,680
didn't you promise your father

943
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,000
to stay out of it?

944
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,120
I won't hurt Xing Liang.

945
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,430
I just want to teach him

946
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,460
a lesson.

947
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,760
- Don't go too far.
- Okay.

948
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,440
Uncle Long,

949
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
sorry to keep you waiting.

950
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,200
We arrived early.

951
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,700
By the way,

952
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,200
this is the friend

953
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,560
I told you before.

954
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,560
This is Mr. Jiang.

955
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Mr. Jiang.

956
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,040
We know each other.

957
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,300
(Serve the People,
