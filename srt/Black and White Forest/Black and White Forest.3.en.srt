00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,740
(Two months ago)

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,180
(Police)

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,520
Nature calls.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,560
I can't hold it in anymore.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
Go.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,800
Go ahead.

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,700
Who was assigned to the arrest tonight?

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,510
Liu Yong and Team No. 3.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,760
It's an elite team

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,840
from Binjiang Police.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,740
This is a big fish

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,480
I've been hunting for years.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
We're going to catch him tonight.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,680
Is Bin there?

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,120
He is really good.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,000
You know,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,080
his name is very high on the list

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,170
of backup forces to be trained

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,760
submitted to the Provincial Department.

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,680
I didn't gave him

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,920
the chance just because

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,400
he's my brother-in-law.

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,620
He is good at work

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,140
and always has good ideas.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,700
He's cut out for a cop.

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,430
He should work in criminal investigation.

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,500
There's nothing we can do.

28
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,300
According to the Civil Service Law,

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,340
close relatives cannot work

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,500
as immediate superior-subordinate.

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,540
Don't you know that?

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,020
I talked to him.

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,140
He's willing to work in public security.

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,460
Hello, Liu Yong.

35
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,820
What?

36
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,660
Take him to the hospital.

37
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,500
What's wrong?

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,500
Bin was assaulted

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,740
and lost his gun.

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,020
The Provincial Department called me

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,380
and asked me

42
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,260
what to do about Bin.

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,660
I'd like to hear your opinion.

44
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,620
Suspension from duty.

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,220
=Black & White Forest=

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,220
=Episode 3=

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,180
You all saw it.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,140
Can you blame me for not catching him?

49
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,020
Did I blame you?

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,740
Did I blame you?

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,140
Anyway,

52
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,900
I have

53
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,900
told you everything.

54
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,900
Do you know who those people are?

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,780
Outlaws.

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,260
Now they know I betrayed him.

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,420
If you don't trust me,

58
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,300
you know,

59
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,460
I'll make a great fool of myself.

60
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,580
I'm such a loser.

61
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,620
Calm down.

62
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,340
We just want to

63
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,420
get some information from you.

64
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,020
If you cooperate with us

65
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,140
to catch him as soon as possible,

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,140
you'll be at peace, right?

67
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,380
I'll cooperate with you.

68
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,020
I will.

69
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,140
We have been

70
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,380
in contact by phone.

71
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,100
But he always uses a disposable SIM card.

72
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,060
We can't find any useful information.

73
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,180
Didn't I give you my cell phone?

74
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,700
Do something!

75
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,940
How do you know this guy?

76
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,860
You didn't just met him on the street, right?

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Dian Lao'er,

78
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,460
you should know

79
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,340
that we take this case very seriously.

80
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,020
If you don't tell us what you know,

81
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,020
it doesn't matter,

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,420
but don't blame us

83
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,780
if we bother you often.

84
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,380
We've heard

85
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,220
that you are

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,260
working on a big project.

87
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,020
You don't want

88
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,580
any gossip

89
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,740
to ruin your business, right?

90
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,660
Sir,

91
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,900
I'll tell you the truth.

92
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,060
In fact, there are

93
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,300
quite a few people

94
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,420
doing this.

95
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,020
What's his phone number?

96
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,300
I contact him online

97
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,580
and in games

98
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,740
every time.

99
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,860
Then he will call me,

100
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,420
but always with

101
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,740
an internet number.

102
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,300
Mr. Xing,

103
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,340
Dian Lao'er

104
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,460
didn't tell us the truth.

105
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,740
Why did you just let him go?

106
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,860
He is utterly shameless.

107
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,740
Even if you kept asking,

108
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,060
you wouldn't get anything.

109
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,180
It's better to let him go.

110
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,140
That way,

111
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,020
he is more likely to be exposed.

112
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,500
Just

113
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,700
have someone watch him closely.

114
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,100
Yes.

115
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,340
Mr. Xing,

116
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,020
Bin was here a while ago.

117
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,820
As you instructed,

118
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,060
I stopped him.

119
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,500
Why is it so hard

120
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,660
to let him behave?

121
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,700
It's like killing him.

122
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,540
You know,

123
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
the loss of his gun

124
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,900
is his biggest worry.

125
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,060
His anxiety

126
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,060
is understandable.

127
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,620
He shouldn't have lost it in the first place!

128
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,900
I know he is anxious,

129
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,660
but it isn't an excuse to be unreasonable,

130
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,500
right?

131
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,260
Back then,

132
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,780
I punished him severely

133
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,820
because I wanted him to recover

134
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,060
and improve himself.

135
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,060
It's been two months now.

136
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,460
Has he made any progress?

137
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Yes.

138
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,620
Bin is a little reckless,

139
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,340
but he's capable.

140
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,700
He is smart,

141
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,300
quick-witted,

142
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,860
and has a wide range of contacts.

143
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,220
He is good at finding clues

144
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,860
and does a good job.

145
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,060
It is reasonable for him

146
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,220
to work on this case.

147
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,540
There's nothing wrong with it.

148
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,500
Perhaps, he would give our unit

149
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,540
a big surprise.

150
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,500
Mr. Xing,

151
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,260
there should be punishments and rewards.

152
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,500
Don't extinguish his enthusiasm,

153
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
or we may take a wrong path.

154
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,460
I'll tell Fei Zai to have dinner with him.

155
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,220
He knows how to convince him.

156
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,460
Forget it.

157
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,020
It's been a long day.

158
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,100
Go home and get some rest.

159
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,060
OK, I'm off, then.

160
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,420
(Tuan Island Market)

161
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,500
What's wrong?

162
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,060
You're frowning and moping.

163
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,580
Only three of the five buddies are left

164
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,340
who came from Wujing.

165
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,460
I'm afraid that Wu...

166
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,220
If I don't take care of Wu's plants,

167
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,460
he'll blame me when he gets back.

168
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,540
Well.

169
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,500
You've been watching Dian Lao'er

170
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,620
and you haven't got anything?

171
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,660
It's not right.

172
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,380
That's what bothers me.

173
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,460
Dian Lao'er is like a turtle

174
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,260
who never leaves his room.

175
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,340
Even if he gets out,

176
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,780
he is followed by two or three cops.

177
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,980
What can I do?

178
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,660
Hello.

179
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,940
I checked with Fei Zai.

180
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,900
The shooter did

181
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,300
have something to do with Dian Lao'er.

182
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,940
You should get someone to test him.

183
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,900
Er'leng told me

184
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,660
that Dian Lao'er never comes out.

185
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,660
When he does, he is followed by cops.

186
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,860
We can't intercept him.

187
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,100
Why would you intercept him?

188
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,740
I told you to test him.

189
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,660
Do you know what is testing?

190
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,060
I'm hanging up.

191
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,900
(Happy Heaven Shroud Shop)

192
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,140
Stop pretending.

193
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
You had been a thief for half your life.

194
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,420
Since you lost a finger,

195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
you suddenly have reverence for life?

196
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,100
Look,

197
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,300
you're in the dead man's business,

198
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,380
but your shop is at a busy train station.

199
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,700
Don't you think it's weird?

200
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,940
Well,

201
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,700
they make money off the living.

202
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,260
I also make money off the living.

203
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,140
If they can open a shop here,

204
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,220
why can't I?

205
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,020
Bin,

206
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,140
this is for you.

207
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,580
Keep it for yourself.

208
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,100
I know

209
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,700
you came to me about something.

210
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,260
But you know what,

211
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,940
I've given up the old business.

212
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,860
I have nothing more to do

213
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,940
with that world.

214
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,540
If you don't mind,

215
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,700
have some tea inside.

216
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,220
If you have no other business,

217
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,940
do what you have to do.

218
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,900
Gave up the old business?

219
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,500
Then are you still in contact

220
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
with your well-informed sources?

221
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,860
I just came to ask for information.

222
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,500
I won't get you in trouble.

223
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,700
I only have this small shop.

224
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,140
If people

225
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,820
keep coming here,

226
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,540
I don't have time to entertain them all.

227
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,420
Fine.

228
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,980
If you don't have time,

229
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,860
I'm leaving.

230
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,100
It's still early.

231
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,940
I'll stop by Ling's parlor.

232
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,740
I happen to have

233
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,980
a good guy

234
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,460
to set her up with.

235
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,060
When you are invited to her wedding,

236
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,620
don't be surprised.

237
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,380
I know everything in Binjiang.

238
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,820
I'll share some gossip with you.

239
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
A while ago,

240
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,140
that wanted criminal,

241
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,140
Zhou Yiwei,

242
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,340
sneaked back to Baisha Village

243
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,340
with a gun.

244
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,420
After a week,

245
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,740
he died.

246
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,660
It is said

247
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,140
that he died the night

248
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,260
of Bao's incident,

249
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,700
and the gun was also gone.

250
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,300
Are you saying

251
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,620
Zhou Yiwei's death

252
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,660
has something to do with the gun?

253
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,140
I didn't say that.

254
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,380
We're just gossiping.

255
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
OK.

256
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,660
Let's share some other gossip.

257
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,420
The gun.

258
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,700
Who has it?

259
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,060
You know,

260
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,820
the locals

261
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,420
are unlikely to steal it.

262
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,580
It's too big a target.

263
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,900
If something happens, they can't get away.

264
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,140
Only the outsiders

265
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,500
dare to play with guns.

266
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,420
Do you recognize this guy?

267
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,780
Wearing a hat and a mask,

268
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,940
he covers himself well.

269
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,300
How can I recognize him?

270
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,820
He has a bit of Lei Da's brow and eyes.

271
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,660
Lei Da?

272
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,580
Who is he?

273
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,260
He came from Na Deng.

274
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,540
He is brutal.

275
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,500
He'll do anything

276
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,340
for money.

277
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,860
He usually carries a bag under his arms.

278
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,340
I heard that someone

279
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
once saw a gun

280
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
in his bag.

281
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,260
I don't know if it's true.

282
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,860
Where is this guy?

283
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,740
Thunder Game Room.

284
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,100
Security work.

285
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,460
Tell Dian Lao'er,

286
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,660
if he doesn't let Wu go,

287
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,740
I'll keep smashing his shops.

288
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,580
Are you clear?

289
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,780
Let's go.

290
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
(Dian 12345 Long)

291
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,780
Hello.

292
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,740
Uncle Long.

293
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,500
What kind of guy did you get for me?

294
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,180
You said he was a professional.

295
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,540
Do you know

296
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,740
how much trouble he has caused me?

297
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,460
I warned you

298
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,020
that everyone

299
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,100
that messed with me

300
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,140
was sent to hell already.

301
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,780
Sir,

302
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,580
don't be mad.

303
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,420
A good temper makes you rich.

304
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,340
You must give me a satisfactory answer,

305
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,500
otherwise,

306
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,820
I'll bury you too.

307
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
I'm just a middleman.

308
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,460
Don't make this difficult for me.

309
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,540
How about this?

310
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,500
I'll talk to him and ask him

311
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,660
to give you a discount.

312
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,900
Is that good enough?

313
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,260
I'm telling you,

314
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,060
I'm not paying him.

315
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,260
On the contrary, he has to pay me.

316
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,180
I

317
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,220
have suffered heavy losses.

318
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,700
You may be dissatisfied with his service.

319
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,460
But he did his job.

320
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,820
As agreed,

321
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,740
you must settle the payment in three days.

322
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,740
He's one-track mind.

323
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,620
If you don't pay, I'm afraid...

324
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,540
Are you threatening me?

325
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,100
Fine, come on.

326
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,060
Tell him to come.

327
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,180
Come to meet me at my house.

328
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,340
I'll be honest with you.

329
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,380
You broke the rules.

330
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,500
I talked to him for a long time

331
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,620
to stop him from shooting you.

332
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,980
Come on, come to me.

333
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,900
Kill me.

334
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
Tell him to come.

335
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,380
I told you he is a professional killer,

336
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,220
but I forgot to mention

337
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,700
that that's his family business.

338
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,740
His whole family is doing this.

339
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,420
Are you sure you want to do this?

340
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,980
I know!

341
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,260
I'll tell you what.

342
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,460
I'm in the middle of something.

343
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,100
I won't waste my time on you.

344
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,620
But listen to me carefully.

345
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,860
200,000,

346
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,060
not a penny

347
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,980
more!

348
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,180
Can you find out their location?

349
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,340
They used

350
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,380
an encrypted network

351
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,620
with servers in Northern Europe.

352
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,340
We can't trace them.

353
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,740
The guy

354
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,380
speaks Chinese with English mixed in.

355
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,300
He has the same habit

356
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,060
as a friend of mine from Gang City.

357
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,500
Keep monitoring Dian Lao'er.

358
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,700
They will get back in touch.

359
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,380
Report anything suspicious

360
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,300
immediately.

361
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,540
Yes.

362
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,620
Lao'er, Lao'er,

363
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,620
bad news.

364
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,700
Bao's guys

365
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,140
smashed two of our shops.

366
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,700
They said that they wouldn't stop

367
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,820
until we gave them Wu.

368
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,620
Tuan Island.

369
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,060
It's serious business.

370
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,500
We're going to make a fortune.

371
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,980
We don't want blood.

372
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,700
Hurry up.

373
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,460
Send our guys there.

374
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,060
Watch it closely!

375
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,940
Yes, I'm on it.

376
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,220
Mr. Xing, we've got something new.

377
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,940
Through the traffic surveillance,

378
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,820
we found the shooter's car

379
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,620
at an intersection.

380
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,940
His face wasn't captured,

381
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,100
but the footage shows

382
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,380
a pattern

383
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,740
resembling a tattoo

384
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,380
on his wrist.

385
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
Zoom in.

386
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,180
That's a special tattoo.

387
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,740
We should be able to get some clues.

388
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,500
Get Fei Zai here.

389
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,420
Yes.

390
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,060
Tell them I told you to go.

391
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,140
They will welcome you warmly

392
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,500
and answer all your questions.

393
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,420
Thank you, Bin.

394
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,500
Be serious, though,

395
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,180
shouldn't you pay me?

396
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,300
It's been several times.

397
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,940
Don't exploit me like this.

398
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,140
What?

399
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
Hello.

400
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,540
Hello, why is the signal so bad?

401
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,980
Unbelievable.

402
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,260
You will regret it.

403
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,900
What are you doing?

404
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,740
Don't you remember me?

405
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,640
Who are you?

406
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,820
The last time at Lei Da's dinner party,

407
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,300
we were drinking together, remember?

408
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,740
You don't remember.

409
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,900
But everyone was drunk that night.

410
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,180
It's normal you forgot it.

411
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,340
Why isn't Lei Da here?

412
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,620
He asked me to come.

413
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,460
Lei Da...

414
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,380
- Lei Da...
- Buddy,

415
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,780
I've got you steamed vermicelli roll.

416
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,220
I asked you to buy it on the next street

417
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,540
and you've been away for over an hour.

418
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,060
Were you hitting on girls again?

419
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,580
No, buddy.

420
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,700
By the way,

421
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,580
come and check

422
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,660
if I got it right.

423
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,620
How can you do it wrong?

424
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,460
Bring it over.

425
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,940
Give me.

426
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,500
Why don't you just tell me

427
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,820
where Lei Da is? I'll go to see him.

428
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,780
He is on the second floor.

429
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,820
Go up to him.

430
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,340
Eat your food.

431
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,900
That's the place.

432
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,300
(Longmen Assassin)

433
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,460
Bin said

434
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,500
the proprietress of this shop is the most

435
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,900
resourceful and well-informed in Binjiang.

436
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,300
She's waiting for us on the second floor.

437
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,060
She should be on the second floor.

438
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,820
Miss.

439
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,900
Do you have an appointment?

440
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,060
No.

441
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,020
I...

442
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,340
We're Bin's friends.

443
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,540
Bin told us to come.

444
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,700
Bin's friends?

445
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,500
Which one of you is Mr. Xing?

446
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,860
That's me.

447
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,540
OK.

448
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,660
Come here.

449
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,060
Pants off,

450
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
lie down on the chair.

451
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,820
Why pants off?

452
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,700
Bin told me

453
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
that he wants a Snoopy tattoo

454
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,740
on his bottom.

455
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,500
Who? Who said...

456
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,980
Sorry, but you may be mistaken.

457
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,820
Here is the thing.

458
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
We're cops.

459
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,380
We want to get some information.

460
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,780
Hey,

461
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,020
what do you want?

462
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,500
Let's talk this over.

463
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,820
Boss,

464
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,860
see if he is the guy.

465
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,220
That's him! Kill him!

466
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,340
This

467
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,860
looks like a totem.

468
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,180
It's too vague.

469
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
I'm not sure.

470
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,700
Wait for a minute.

471
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,940
I think it's here.

472
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,500
Here, look at this.

473
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,060
Is it this?

474
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,980
Put up with it.

475
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,060
Tianyi.

476
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,340
Take a dozen guys

477
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,950
with Big Eye Chen

478
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,420
to the guy named...

479
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,700
- Red Hair.
- Yeah.

480
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,620
Beat him up.

481
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,540
Yes.

482
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Don't move.

483
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,860
They didn't hurt me badly.

484
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,700
No big deal.

485
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,060
No big deal?

486
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,140
Then why were you screaming?

487
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,220
He rubbed me the wrong way.

488
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,140
No.

489
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,380
I think

490
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,780
you're really stupid.

491
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,980
I just smashed his shop.

492
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,900
Why would you go there to look for trouble?

493
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,100
Bao, I really think

494
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
something is wrong with this.

495
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,540
What's wrong?

496
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,240
Now everyone

497
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,140
is diverting our attention

498
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,740
towards Dian Lao'er.

499
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,620
It's going too well.

500
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,180
So

501
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,860
what's the problem?

502
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,900
Now all the evidence

503
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,220
points to Dian Lao'er.

504
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,300
Look.

505
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,060
In Binjiang, isn't Dian Lao'er

506
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,460
the only one who dares to challenge Bao?

507
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,020
Doesn't his guy

508
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,420
happen to have a gun?

509
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,460
And you didn't see anyone there, right?

510
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,220
Don't you think Dan Lao'er hid him?

511
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,340
He did it, obviously.

512
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
Isn't it going too well?

513
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,500
Only a creature

514
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,860
with brawn but no brains like you

515
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,620
could think of something like this.

516
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,180
You're smart.

517
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,980
Then you tell me

518
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,820
what to do.

519
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,940
Where's your boss?

520
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,660
He will be away for a few days.

521
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
Call him

522
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,980
and tell him I have a big order.

523
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,970
Ask him to come over right away.

524
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,220
I can't reach him, either.

525
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,020
Why don't you come back in a few days?

526
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,700
We can't wait. Call him.

527
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,660
Are you done?

528
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,500
You smashed two of my shops in one day.

529
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,780
Can't we talk this over?

530
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,260
(Dian Lao'er)
My request is simple.

531
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,180
Give Wu to me.

532
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,820
Wu hurt my boys.

533
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,500
We haven't settled the score yet.

534
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,820
You want him?

535
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,660
OK.

536
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,100
Beg me!

537
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,420
Dan Lao'er,

538
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,940
do you have no shame?

539
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,060
You're getting even worse, aren't you?

540
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,580
You can't even lift a machete, can you?

541
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,100
I'm telling you,

542
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,260
either you let Wu go,

543
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,620
or I will

544
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,020
smash

545
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,860
all your shops every day.

546
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,700
Don't get impulsive.

547
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,660
Come on, let me talk to him.

548
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,820
Talk what?

549
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,820
If he dares to mess with me,

550
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,980
I'm going to beat him up..

551
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,700
Did you hear me?

552
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,620
Bao,

553
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,860
you reminded me.

554
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,380
What did we do before?

555
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,100
What about this?

556
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,940
This afternoon,

557
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
four o'clock,

558
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,740
Julong Dock,

559
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,180
see you there.

560
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,380
If you win,

561
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,660
take him away.

562
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,640
If you lose,

563
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,140
leave Tuan Island.

564
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,980
Is that OK?

565
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
OK!

566
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,500
Nice!

567
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,540
I promise you.

568
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,020
Don't blame me for talking too much.

569
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,420
I know

570
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,300
you're well connected.

571
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,900
Don't bring the cops there.

572
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,940
Whoever brings the cops

573
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,060
is an untrustworthy scum.

574
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,020
(Dian Lao'er)

575
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,580
Get our guys

576
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,300
and weapons ready.

577
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,580
Beat him up.

578
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,500
Nobody will

579
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,940
tell Bin

580
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,580
about this.

581
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,740
Got it.

582
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,860
Got it.

583
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,980
Man,

584
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
you shouldn't tell him either.

585
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
I know.

586
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,940
Don't worry about it.

587
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,220
Drink more water.

588
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,660
Reduce your inner heat.

589
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,220
(Bihaihui Hot Spring Health Spa)

590
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,300
You're good.

591
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,020
You used to steal.

592
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,420
Now you start to lie.

593
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,780
And you're good at hiding.

594
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,100
With food and drink here,

595
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,020
you can even enjoy life.

596
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,780
Bin,

597
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,020
no, no,

598
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,700
I didn't lie to you.

599
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,020
Tell me

600
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,500
what happened to Lei Da's gun?

601
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,140
No, no.

602
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,420
I'll tell you.

603
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,500
I'll tell you everything.

604
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,460
Everything.

605
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,420
Everything.

606
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,460
Bin,

607
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,620
I didn't want to lie to you.

608
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,020
But someone

609
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,660
made me do it.

610
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,300
A stranger?

611
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,140
Yes.

612
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,020
He

613
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,460
wore a fisherman's hat

614
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,300
and a mask,

615
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,540
with a black mole on his neck.

616
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,180
Right.

617
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,300
He looks a bit like the portrait

618
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,420
you showed me.

619
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,300
The man told me

620
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,540
to lead them to Lei Da

621
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,820
if anyone came to ask me about the gun.

622
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,940
I think he knows Lei Da well.

623
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,140
Bin,

624
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,380
I didn't mean to lie to you.

625
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,580
Anything else?

626
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,260
The man spoke

627
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,540
with a slight Ninghai accent.

628
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,500
Just like a friend of mine.

629
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,980
Anything else?

630
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,780
No.

631
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,860
No, really.

632
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,660
Does he have a tattoo?

633
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,540
Don't you know

634
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,540
that tattoo?

635
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,460
I've seen that tattoo before.

636
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,660
About ten years ago,

637
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,780
a guy offended a boss

638
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,540
in Hanjiang.

639
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,780
The boss

640
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,700
hired a guy

641
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,020
who did dirty work,

642
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,660
and he

643
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,220
had the same tattoo.

644
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,940
I heard

645
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,940
that the guy was from Da An Alliance.

646
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,620
There's a place in Da An Alliance

647
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,700
where you can hire people to do dirty work.

648
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,900
Bin,

649
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,100
you know what,

650
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,780
they know everything about me.

651
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,660
Are you so good now?

652
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,740
Even those people know you.

653
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,180
I'm so scared.

654
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,340
OK, I got it.

655
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,060
OK.

656
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,380
Finished so quickly?

657
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,740
Don't stare at me. Let's go.

658
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,460
Are you hiding something from me?

659
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
No. No.

660
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,780
Dude, what could I possibly

661
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,900
hide from you?

662
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,860
Don't be so paranoid all day.

663
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,660
Fine, from today,

664
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,700
if you can get a girl,

665
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
I'll take your last name.

666
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,660
No, dude.

667
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,060
I didn't, really?

668
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,020
- What's up?
- I...

669
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,220
Dian Lao'er asked to meet Bao.

670
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,300
What?

671
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,700
Based on Wu Ling's tip,

672
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,180
we contacted Na Meng Police for assistance.

673
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,460
We've confirmed

674
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,300
that the tattoo

675
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,980
is a unique local image

676
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,540
with a clear meaning.

677
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,260
We've sent them the portrait

678
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,450
and characteristics of the shooter.

679
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,060
What did you say?

680
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
I didn't hear you.

681
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,540
Say it again.

682
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,420
I said the shooter had a Ninghai accent,

683
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,900
a mole on his neck,

684
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,060
and a tattoo on his wrist.

685
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,220
You should have known this.

686
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,180
But according to a reliable source,

687
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,620
the guy is probably from Da An Alliance.

688
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,300
There's a gang doing dirty work.

689
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,580
Get someone to look into it.

690
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,860
(Da An Alliance)

691
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,980
(Julong Dock)

692
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,800
Bao.

693
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,730
Bao.

694
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,220
He is right here.

695
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,780
Let's see if you can

696
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,460
take him away.

697
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,900
Dian Lao'er,

698
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,460
who gave you the nerve

699
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,460
to be so overbearing?

700
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,420
Have you forgotten

701
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,540
the lessons I've taught you

702
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,460
all these years?

703
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,700
Come on, guys.

704
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,620
Let's help him recall them.

705
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,340
Are you afraid, guys?

706
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,500
Fei Zai, tell the Riot Squad

707
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,900
- to stand by in place for now.
- Yes.

708
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,580
- Police.
- Police.

709
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,940
Move. Move.

710
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,660
Hello, sir.

711
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,660
So many people.

712
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,580
Are you having a square dancing contest?

713
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,020
Mr. Chen,

714
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
what's going on here?

715
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,900
Bao had to make a little movie.

716
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,380
He asked me to bring my guys here

717
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,980
to help him out.

718
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,620
This is the male lead.

719
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,860
Right, Bao?

720
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,020
Xing Liang,

721
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,500
what are you doing?

722
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,180
Have you got the guy?

723
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,220
Do you have nothing better to do?

724
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,420
Bao Chenyan,

725
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,380
how old are you?

726
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,700
Are you still playing

727
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
the gangster here?

728
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,940
What do you want?

729
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,820
Do you want me to call his sister over

730
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
to watch you guys fight?

731
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,380
Mr. Chen,

732
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,620
what you want to do

733
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,500
and how you want to do it

734
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
is none of my business.

735
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,420
But don't forget what I reminded you.

736
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,140
Don't let your side business

737
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,540
delay your main business.

738
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,780
Yes, sure.

739
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,460
I should focus on my business

740
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,260
and stop doing useless stuff.

741
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,940
Fortunately, you're here,

742
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,620
or else we would be in trouble.

743
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,780
Alright, I'm heading home.

744
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,140
My dog will bite if it gets hungry.

745
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,340
It doesn't matter.

746
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,260
If the alpha dog is gone,

747
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,620
the rest of the dogs will melt away.

748
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,820
They won't be starved. What do you think?

749
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,180
I know.

750
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,140
I know.

751
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,260
Wait.

752
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,500
Don't you think your buddies

753
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,620
should leave their stuff here?

754
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
It's scary.

755
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,540
Leave all your props here.

756
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,090
Put them down.

757
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,620
I'll take the lead.

758
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,920
Bao,

759
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
let's take a rain check.

760
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,260
Put your weapons down.

761
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,140
Er'leng.

762
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,420
Come over!

763
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,270
Yes, sir.

764
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Go.

765
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,100
Why don't we arrest them?

766
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,220
