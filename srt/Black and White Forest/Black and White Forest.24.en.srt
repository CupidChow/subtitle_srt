1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,720
You've made me speechless.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,040
(Eleven years ago)

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,240
I told you to find a good

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,920
accountant,

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,160
and I will pay for that!

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,160
Why didn't you listen?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,720
Do you have to do this?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,600
It's been three months!

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,200
Look what you've done!

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
It's a mess!

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,920
Bao.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,320
Don't be angry.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,560
Sometimes, men and women are the same.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,360
You might get sick from anger.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,440
Bao.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,720
It's just simple
addition and subtraction, right?

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,680
Please give us one day.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,880
We'll figure it out.

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,480
If you hire another person,

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,320
you'll have to...

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,200
You'll have to pay for the salary
and living expenses,

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,160
right?

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,880
You'll pay extra money
for the same work.

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,120
Shut up!

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,960
Do you want to piss me off?

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,520
Don't you remember?

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,160
You came to Wuhan from Shanxi

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,480
to sell clothes

29
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,200
and lost everything.

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,760
You were chased and threatened

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,960
by creditors.

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,560
Don't make Bao angry.

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Bao, calm down.

34
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,720
Think about it.
If hadn't been for Bao and me,

35
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
you would've been dead.

36
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Yes, you went to middle school,

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,600
so what?

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,040
Bao, I've been following you
since primary school.

39
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,240
I can find a good fighter,

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,760
but it's really hard for me

41
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,120
to find an accountant.

42
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,600
Er'leng,

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,360
why are you so proud of

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
not finishing primary school?

45
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,240
I can't believe this!

46
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,200
You two really did

47
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,920
a good job.

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
You settled the accounts

49
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,480
separately.

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,840
In three days,

51
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,440
each of you calculated six times

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,760
and came up with 12 numbers,

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,160
and they're

54
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,320
all different!

55
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
You said accountants were useless.

56
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,800
I hired one for one morning

57
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,160
and paid him 200 yuan,

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,120
and he calculated it correctly.

59
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,240
Aren't you ashamed?

60
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,920
Come in!

61
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,440
Who?

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Hello,

63
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,480
I want to apply for the job.

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,760
This is my resume.

65
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,860
(Personal Resume)

66
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
Gang City University.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,920
Master Degree?

68
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,000
For real?

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Yes.

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,520
I can get a Harvard

71
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
degree certificate for 300 yuan.

72
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,360
Harvard? Which city?

73
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,320
Stop talking! Both of you!

74
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,360
No one cares about your opinion!

75
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,960
Come here.

76
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,160
You want this job.

77
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,560
Anyway, you need to pass the interview.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
I happen to have an account book.

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
Calculate it.

80
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,280
I'll give you a morning. Oh, no.

81
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,480
You have two hours

82
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,960
to settle the accounts.

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,720
Wu, Er'leng.

84
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,000
Find a room for him

85
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
and give him a pen.

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Watch him for two hours.

87
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
He'll calculate it.

88
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
He's reading it so quickly.

89
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,200
What is he doing?

90
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,090
What do you mean?

91
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
I've finished it.

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
How?

93
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,600
Just simple mental arithmetic.

94
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,240
Bro.

95
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Just simple mental arithmetic?

96
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Your words really hurt

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
my feelings,

98
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,120
but I like that.

99
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,880
Well,

100
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,040
what do you need?

101
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,350
I only want basic salaries

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,380
and the company's
future dividend payouts.

103
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,880
You can be

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
more specific.

105
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Which means

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
if the company makes a lot of money,

107
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
I want to get a share.

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,040
From now on,

109
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200
you'll work for me.

110
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,040
What's your name?

111
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm Tu Manjiang.

112
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,060
=Black&White Forest=

113
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,060
=Episode 24=

114
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,450
(Uncle Long?)
Lin Yisheng

115
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,680
was hired by Tu Manjiang.

116
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,640
But Tu Manjiang has worked

117
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,760
for Bao for eleven years.

118
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,400
He's always been hard-working and loyal.

119
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
Why would he betray Bao?

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
I can't figure it out either.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Well,

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,040
why would

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,160
Tu Manjiang,

124
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,520
an educated man,

125
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,800
work for

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
a gangster leader?

127
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,560
They're so different.

128
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,440
Back then, Bao needed
a professional expert

129
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
to help him,

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,960
but real talents didn't want

131
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,280
to join a small company.

132
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,800
Then Tu Manjiang came,

133
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,560
and he stayed there.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,880
To be honest,

135
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,080
Bao's company
couldn't have come this far

136
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,000
without Tu Manjiang.

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,400
However, I've got this feeling

138
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
that Tu Manjiang

139
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,880
is so strange.

140
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,320
Take us for an example.

141
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,550
If we want a job,

142
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,480
we'll either choose a high-salary job

143
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,640
or

144
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,930
a big company.

145
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,090
With Tu Manjiang's ability,

146
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,410
he could find

147
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,450
a much better job than this one,

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,840
and it'd be more comfortable.

149
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,100
Why would he

150
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,690
work with

151
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,790
(Tu Manjiang)
Bao and his brothers?

152
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,180
Why did he

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,380
choose Bao Chenyan?

154
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,500
It doesn't

155
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,940
make sense to us,

156
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,860
which means we're missing something.

157
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,820
We need to investigate

158
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,520
(Tu Manjiang, Lin Yisheng)
them,

159
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,740
especially Lin Yisheng.

160
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,420
A financial crime

161
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,300
is often complicated

162
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,460
and covert.

163
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,100
Therefore,

164
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,900
we have to find solid evidence.

165
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,740
Yu,

166
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,380
Fei Zai,

167
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,020
go to Haicheng

168
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,540
to investigate

169
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
their parent company.

170
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,900
Yes, sir.

171
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,900
Yes, sir.

172
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,780
(Marketing Center)

173
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,500
Well, Mr. Lin,

174
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,860
Uncle Man told us to pick you up.

175
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,700
Are you sure?

176
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,620
Mr. Tu didn't tell me.

177
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,020
This can't be a mistake.

178
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,380
Uncle Man told us to come.

179
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,740
Then I'll call him.

180
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,580
Please don't.

181
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,460
Don't you believe us?

182
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,580
Here's the thing.

183
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,500
Uncle Man is meeting with a client

184
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,980
who's very interested in

185
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,940
your project

186
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,900
and wants to talk to you.

187
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,580
They're discussing it right now.

188
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,620
They're waiting for you.

189
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,700
Let's go.

190
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,740
Don't keep them waiting.

191
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,460
Hurry up. It's about your project.

192
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,420
Come on.

193
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,260
Let's go.

194
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,580
Bao.

195
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,820
What's wrong?

196
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,260
Sit down.

197
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,540
What's this for?

198
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,140
Man.

199
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,020
I'll make

200
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,700
the first toast.

201
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,100
Let me toast to you.

202
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,980
What's wrong?

203
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,220
We've worked together for eleven years.

204
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,940
Have you ever taken me

205
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,540
for your brother?

206
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,260
When I decided to take this job,

207
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,220
I told you

208
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,900
I did it for you because you're

209
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
reliable.

210
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,860
I don't have

211
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,580
other family in this world.

212
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,620
I've always wanted

213
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,300
a brother like you.

214
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,740
It's been eleven years.

215
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
I've never changed.

216
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,220
Mr. Lin, why don't you eat?

217
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,740
Come on.

218
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,420
Have some food.

219
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,180
Wait, where's Mr. Tu?

220
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,740
Why isn't he here?

221
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,500
Don't worry.

222
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,220
He'll be here soon.

223
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
How about this?

224
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,140
Maybe next time. I'll call Mr. Tu

225
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,300
and tell him I have work to do.

226
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,940
What's the rush?

227
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,500
We can talk before he comes.

228
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,780
Talk about what?

229
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,820
About how much money you want to steal

230
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,660
from the project.

231
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,420
I'll make

232
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,140
another toast.

233
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,740
You've helped me a lot

234
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,860
with the company.

235
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,940
I've always had a line in my heart.

236
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,020
Some people are inside it,

237
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,340
and some are not.

238
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,860
Inside the line,

239
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,540
there are Zixuan,

240
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,140
Binbin,

241
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,620
Er'leng,

242
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
and you.

243
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,900
So, I've never lied to you.

244
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm always telling the truth

245
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,700
in front of you.

246
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,220
Are you

247
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,780
doing the same thing?

248
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,060
I admit

249
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,940
I don't always say things

250
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,860
I'm confident about,

251
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,100
but

252
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,620
I've never lied about anything

253
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,420
bad for the company.

254
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,660
You are

255
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,020
my boss.

256
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,460
I know

257
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,300
the rules.

258
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,060
The Tuan Island project

259
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,980
is our common cause.

260
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,260
What we're doing is legal

261
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,940
and good for the country

262
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,300
and the people.

263
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
How can you accuse me of stealing?

264
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,740
You're

265
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,900
confident.

266
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,020
Well said.

267
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,220
But I still don't believe you.

268
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,980
Why am I talking to

269
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,860
a bunch of

270
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,780
unreasonable people?

271
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,780
Listen,

272
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,940
let me go. Otherwise...

273
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,660
You shut up!

274
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
Listen,

275
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm not as patient as Bin.

276
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,460
If you don't tell me

277
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,420
the truth,

278
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,300
you won't get out alive.

279
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,620
Bao.

280
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,340
Can I toast to you

281
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,780
this time?

282
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,820
Man,

283
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,900
we've been friends

284
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,580
for over ten years.

285
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,940
If you tell me the truth,

286
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,620
I'll forgive you.

287
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,340
Bao, what truth?

288
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,260
You know me well.

289
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
If I'm not sure,

290
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
I won't ask.

291
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,260
Now I'm asking you.

292
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,500
This is your chance.

293
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,180
If you don't tell me the truth,

294
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,660
I'll bury you

295
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,460
in this pit.

296
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,940
This is murder.

297
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,220
It's illegal.

298
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,900
You're breaking the law, understand?

299
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,860
Maybe I can cut you into pieces,

300
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,660
boil you in the pot,

301
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,540
and find

302
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,340
a deserted forest

303
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,820
to bury you.

304
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,660
They'll never find you.

305
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,940
What can they do?

306
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,500
Do you dare to kill me?

307
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,860
You're so annoying!

308
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,020
Say it!

309
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,820
Say it!

310
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,860
No!

311
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,820
Okay! Okay!

312
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,780
Get off him!

313
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,380
What are you doing?

314
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,140
I'm tired.

315
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
Mr. Lin,

316
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,060
please cooperate.

317
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,340
And you, don't be so rude!

318
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,380
The Make Money project

319
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
is real.

320
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,740
It's a good company.

321
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Hey, stop!

322
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,740
Please.

323
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,860
Sit down, okay?

324
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,140
Please sit down.

325
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,500
Please sit down.

326
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,940
Mr. Tu

327
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,820
did do something

328
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,820
behind Bao's back.

329
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,980
I think

330
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,820
it has something to do with Qi Hanchen.

331
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,940
(Income and Expenditure Book)

332
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,220
I let you manage

333
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,300
our money alone,

334
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,820
and I've never asked about it.

335
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,220
Binbin said you betrayed me.

336
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,580
I don't believe him.

337
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,220
However, what's going on here?

338
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,100
You transferred five million yuan

339
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,580
to a shell company!

340
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,980
Have I wronged you?

341
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,740
(Income and Expenditure Book)

342
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,100
Give me a reason

343
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,380
to forgive you.

344
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,460
I gave it

345
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,180
to Qi Hanchen.

346
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,380
Qi Hanchen!

347
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,100
Have you been

348
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,940
colluding with him

349
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,340
to set me up?

350
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,700
No.

351
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,780
If I wanted to set you up,

352
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,060
you would never find out.

353
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,860
Why would you do this?

354
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,980
Why?

355
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,940
What else could it be?

356
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,660
For you.

357
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,660
For the company.

358
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,540
For your ridiculous

359
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,980
responsibilities for the vendors.

360
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,260
For your leadership.

361
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,660
For the livelihoods

362
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,020
of our brothers!

363
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,220
Go on.

364
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,980
Bao.

365
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,980
As a gangster leader,

366
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,180
you're successful.

367
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
As a businessman,

368
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,940
you're a loser.

369
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,540
I know Qi Hanchen is our enemy,

370
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,980
but I have to give him money.

371
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,940
I have to cooperate with him!

372
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,900
No matter what,

373
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,260
you shouldn't have betrayed me!

374
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,740
You've known the rules

375
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,460
since the day you joined us!

376
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,940
I knew

377
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,340
you'd be pissed off

378
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,980
when you find out,

379
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,860
but I never expected

380
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,380
you'd doubt me.

381
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,060
You've never trusted me.

382
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,300
Why did you hand over
your company to me?

383
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,340
Sit down.

384
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,420
I want an explanation.

385
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,860
I gave Qi Hanchen money

386
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,500
for the Make Money project.

387
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,620
Financial license?

388
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
What's that?

389
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,900
According to the law,

390
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,820
we must get
an official financial license

391
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,780
to carry out

392
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,780
small and medium-sized lending activities.

393
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,580
Otherwise,

394
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,700
Make Money project

395
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,820
will be

396
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,460
illegal.

397
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,940
I gave Qi Hanchen money

398
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,540
to share his financial license.

399
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
In that case,

400
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,140
Lin Yisheng's money

401
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,460
will be processed by

402
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,300
a licensed company.

403
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,700
Even if something happens
to Lin Yisheng,

404
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,940
we'll still be able to
protect the vendors.

405
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,380
So,

406
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,060
Make Money is a good project,

407
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,980
and you have a backup plan.

408
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,780
Why didn't you

409
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,580
tell Ms. Wen and me?

410
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Because his money
can't be transferred immediately,

411
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,820
and we're in urgent need of funds.

412
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,620
The entire Binjiang knows

413
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,100
you got the Tuan Island project.

414
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,580
As for fund-raising,

415
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,060
real entrepreneurs
wouldn't dare join us,

416
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,380
and those who hold a grudge against you

417
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,620
don't want to help us.

418
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,620
It's the only project

419
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,140
that can raise enough funds

420
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,300
to support the Tuan Island project.

421
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,660
Why do you have to

422
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,580
work with Qi Hanchen?

423
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,940
Because he's the only
qualified person left.

424
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
I didn't tell you

425
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,500
because I knew you wouldn't agree.

426
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,180
But I don't have time to convince you.

427
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,980
Bao,

428
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,580
business is not like gangs.

429
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,660
Gangsters care about brotherhood

430
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,820
while businessmen only want money.

431
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
As long as it's profitable,

432
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,820
enemies can become partners.

433
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,220
Qi Hanchen is our rival,

434
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,380
but it doesn't mean
we can't make money together.

435
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,740
I shouldn't have

436
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
lied to you,

437
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,020
but I don't regret it.

438
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,500
Stop.

439
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,780
It's enough.

440
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,180
Okay.

441
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,820
(Financial Cooperation Agreement)

442
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,540
I've told you everything.

443
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,900
It's up to you.

444
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,580
(Financial Cooperation Agreement)

445
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,210
The problem

446
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,660
lies in my funds.

447
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,780
Mr. Tu had no choice.

448
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,260
Bao,

449
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,380
please don't blame him.

450
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,700
Mr. Tu didn't do this

451
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,220
for his own interest

452
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,060
but for the bigger picture.

453
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,660
We don't need an explanation.

454
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
You didn't tell Bao about it.

455
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,580
You made a huge mistake.

456
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,460
I admit it,

457
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,380
but I don't regret it.

458
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,940
Make Money project

459
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,500
will benefit

460
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,420
our company

461
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,420
and the vendors.

462
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,870
Financial fraud is rampant.

463
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,000
Bao.

464
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,390
It's very complicated.

465
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,380
Be careful.

466
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,300
Bao,

467
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,780
Tuan Island has made us

468
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,140
lose a lot of money.

469
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,540
The only profit

470
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,020
comes from the stall rents.

471
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,420
Look,

472
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,460
of the vendors can't pay the rent,

473
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,340
we won't make money.

474
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,580
If we don't have money,
the project will fail.

475
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,060
Therefore, Make Money

476
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,050
is not just for the vendors

477
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,730
but for our company.

478
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,020
Bao, I know you don't trust Bao.

479
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,780
You think he'll play dirty

480
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,620
like he did before.

481
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,500
However, things have changed.

482
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,300
He's the biggest shareholder
of this project.

483
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,740
We're on the same boat.

484
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,700
As a businessman,

485
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,500
he also understands this.

486
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,980
As for Make Money,

487
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm willing to vouch

488
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,260
for the project.

489
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,500
Man.

490
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,580
All the vendors

491
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,060
in the market

492
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,380
are our old friends.

493
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,340
It's been over ten years.

494
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,380
They don't have

495
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,740
much money.

496
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,380
Therefore, this project

497
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
cannot fail.

498
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
Bao, I know you're worried,

499
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,820
but the vendors

500
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,460
can make decisions on their own.

501
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,340
Mr. Lin.

502
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,020
How about this?

503
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,020
If anyone

504
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,940
who get a loan regrets it,

505
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,140
they'll only need

506
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,620
to repay the principal within three days

507
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,660
instead of the interest.

508
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,180
As for the deposits,

509
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,060
we'll pay them back immediately.

510
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,100
If you don't have money,

511
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,180
write IOUs,

512
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,980
and I'll vouch for you,

513
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,380
okay?

514
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,820
Okay.

515
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,740
Bao,

516
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,380
how about you?

517
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Are you happy now?

518
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,420
Come on. Take a look.

519
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,780
Yes. Right here.

520
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,980
If you have any doubts,

521
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,060
you can get a refund

522
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,340
within three days

523
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,100
for the loans

524
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,220
or the deposits.

525
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,580
As for the details,

526
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
you can read the file

527
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,540
or ask me.

528
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,980
Come on.

529
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,740
What's wrong with them?

530
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,660
Usually, they're very stingy.

531
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,540
Why are they

532
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,940
so generous today?

533
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,460
Hui.

534
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,980
Bao, come on,

535
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,820
have a seat.

536
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,900
Make Money project is issuing refunds.

537
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,060
You can get your money back.

538
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,380
Why?

539
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,700
It's a good project.

540
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,740
I'll be honest with you.

541
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,900
It's Mr. Lin's project.

542
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,060
Bao doesn't know much about it.

543
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,580
Besides, financial fraud is rampant.

544
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,980
It's your money.

545
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,180
- It's okay.
- Hui.

546
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,420
If you need money, you can ask me.

547
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,460
Don't join the project.

548
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,820
Bao,

549
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,260
I know you care about me,

550
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,980
but you've helped me a lot.

551
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,900
Besides, the project seems reliable.

552
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,860
Are you out of your mind?

553
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,620
You think it's reliable?

554
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,780
How do you know?

555
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,380
At first, I wasn't sure about it,

556
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,180
but Man invested all his money.

557
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,980
He's an expert.

558
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,940
It has to be profitable.

559
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,020
You believe him?

560
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,060
Do you remember what he did

561
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
when you needed money?

562
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
You're wrong about him.

563
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,100
Actually,

564
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,850
I borrowed it from Man,

565
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,020
but I said it was my relative's money

566
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,860
because he asked me to.

567
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,460
He said

568
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,620
he couldn't

569
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,290
help everyone

570
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,260
but the ones in urgent need of money.

571
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,220
He didn't want to cause trouble,

572
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,340
so he asked me to keep a secret.

573
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,860
Man is a good guy,

574
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,820
and Make Money project

575
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,060
has helped me a lot.

576
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,220
They also think it can help them,

577
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,340
so they're investing

578
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,580
their money into it.

579
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,260
Besides,

580
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,460
if it was a fraud,

581
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,460
why would they

582
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,660
ask us to get a refund.

583
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,500
Not everyone is a good person.

584
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,860
Man.

585
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,660
We haven't finished

586
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,260
the third drink.

587
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,580
I'll toast to you.

588
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,580
I want to apologize to you

589
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,340
in front of them.

590
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,580
Bro.

591
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,540
I'm sorry.

592
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,180
I shouldn't have

593
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,420
hidden it

594
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,740
from you.

595
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,420
I'm grateful

596
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,900
that you can forgive me.

597
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,180
Hey,

598
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,980
are we still brothers?

599
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,690
Bao,

600
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,100
what about the Make Money project?

601
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,380
We can do it,

602
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,580
but I don't trust Lin Yisheng.

603
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,220
Man,

604
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,220
please

605
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,700
keep an eye on him.

606
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,100
Bao, I'll take care of it.

607
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,340
I won't allow him to harm

608
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,700
the interests of the vendors.

609
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,100
Don't worry.

610
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,340
Come on.

611
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,140
What are you doing?

612
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
There's a fly.

613
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,540
It's disgusting.

614
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,740
Look at you.

615
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,020
Man.

616
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,100
Sit down.

617
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,540
Let's get drunk.

618
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,620
Enough.

619
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,740
Enough!

620
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,700
Eat some food.

621
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,620
What the hell?

622
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,900
- Come out.
- Bro, why did you

623
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,100
drag me out?

624
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,060
You were so childish.
I couldn't stand it,

625
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,140
so I dragged you out.

626
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,260
You should be grateful.

627
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,260
I told you

628
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,100
Bao would fall for it.

629
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,220
You didn't listen.

630
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Do you really dislike Uncle Man

631
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,420
or do you think Make Money project

632
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,460
has a problem?

633
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,460
What's the difference?

634
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,260
That hypocrite is up to no good!

635
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,140
Is that my sister?

636
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,540
- Let's go back.
- What?

637
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,620
- Follow me.
- What?

638
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,740
Come on! Let's go!

639
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,980
Sister.

640
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,100
Why are you here?

641
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
I miss you, sister.

642
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,700
Who's this?

643
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,860
Mr. An,

644
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,020
sorry, this is my brother Luo Tianyi.

645
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,540
This is Bin.

646
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,900
Brother, right?

647
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,940
Hello, I'm An Zhiqiang.

648
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,940
Tianyi.

649
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,900
It's time to go back.

650
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,940
Listen, don't you dare touch her.

651
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,220
Sister, goodbye.

652
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,100
- What the hell?
- Wait!

653
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,860
(Sun Changhai, Uncle Long)

654
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,900
Zhang.

655
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,260
Okay.

656
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,900
I'm coming.

657
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,820
What's wrong with you?

658
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,140
You're a smart guy.

659
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,100
Why are you so scared

660
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,220
of my sister?

661
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,980
He doesn't look like a good guy.

662
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,820
You should've beaten him up.

663
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,420
I'm not her boyfriend.

664
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,060
What can I do?

665
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,020
Your sister can choose
whoever she likes.

666
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,060
Wait. What's going on?

667
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,780
It went well, didn't it?

668
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,180
You were so close to success.

669
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,100
What happened?

670
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,980
I don't know!

671
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,620
Maybe she still cares about the fact

672
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,900
that I haven't

673
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,180
got my job back.

674
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,060
Bro, are you really stupid
or playing dumb?

675
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,020
Even I can tell she likes you,

676
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,900
and you'll go back to work
sooner or later.

677
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,740
Do you think she'll care about that?

678
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,580
Huh?

679
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,860
Besides,

680
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,540
even if she does,

681
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
shouldn't you stop

682
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,580
that guy?

683
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,380
You didn't drink much.

684
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,760
Why are you so drunk?

685
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,020
God.

686
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,300
Where did you go?

687
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,180
Give me a hand.

688
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,020
Look at you.

689
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,860
Take a sip.

690
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
I added some mango.

691
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,780
What a waste.

692
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,340
How is it?

693
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,420
Stop looking. Come on.

694
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,260
Get him in the car.

695
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,140
Hurry up. Come on.

696
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,540
I told you not to drink too much.

697
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,300
Hurry. Get the door.

698
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,340
Be careful.

699
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,700
Okay.

700
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,820
Come on.

701
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,820
Feet.

702
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,060
Where are you going?

703
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,140
Wait for my sister.

704
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,340
Listen, sort this out,

705
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,540
or you can't fall asleep.

706
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,680
Found anything?

707
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,530
Well,

708
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,070
I sent the phone recording

709
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,740
of Chen Mingyuan and Uncle Long

710
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,060
to my teacher

711
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,620
and asked him to analyze it.

712
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,100
I just wanted

713
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,640
to give it a try,

714
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,780
but I didn't expect

715
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,300
to find this.

716
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,500
Come on. Play it.

717
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,660
They said

718
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,170
you sold them out twice,

719
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,770
and they were arrested.

720
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,680
They want 1 million yuan.

721
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,710
If you don't agree,

722
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,100
it won't be

723
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,780
as easy as killing a dog.

724
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,740
He was in a car,

725
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,150
but it doesn't mean anything.

726
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,490
Listen carefully.

727
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,900
You sold them out twice,

728
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,500
and they were arrested.

729
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,540
Does that mean the place

730
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,180
where Uncle Long's car passed
was holding

731
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,630
the 5th-anniversary event?

732
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,540
I remember we couldn't locate him,

733
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,980
but we knew

734
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,900
he was in Shenchuan.

735
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,890
We can estimate the distance

736
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,300
between the car and the sound

737
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,620
based on the volume.

738
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,700
Really?

739
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,980
Come on. Play it again.

740
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,860
(Binjiang Criminal Police Unit)

741
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,900
Why are you sitting here?

742
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,220
If I didn't see you,

743
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,540
you'd be hit by my car.

744
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,300
I want to talk to you.

745
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,540
It's late. Maybe next time.

746
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,500
Fan.

747
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,500
I asked you out,

748
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,900
but you said you were busy.

749
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,100
You didn't reply to me either.

750
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,980
I just want to know

751
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,100
if I made a mistake

752
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,020
and made you angry.

753
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,340
I promise I can change.

754
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,460
It's not your fault.

755
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,460

as for our relationship,

757
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,820
I want to think it through.

758
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,820
I've made up my mind.

759
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,340
I only want to be with you.

760
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,860
Is it because I'm not reinstated?

761

What happened?

789
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
Nothing.

790
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,060
Bao accepted Lin Yisheng's
Make Money project,

791
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,340
and the vendors

792
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,580
are very supportive.

793
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,940
I didn't know

794
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,860
Tu Manjiang had such a big influence.

795
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,060
He...

796
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,220
He's capable

797
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,090
and has a good temper.

798
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,500
He won't be rude to anyone.

799
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
However, I still think

800
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,340
there's a distance between us.

801
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,740
It's like I can't

802
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,980
see through him

803
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,300
or make friends with him.

804
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,260
Do you know his experience

805
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,140
in South Korea?

806
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,410
He doesn't talk about himself.

807
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,060
What's wrong?

808
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,060
His resume is very clear

809
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,700
about his experience in different times,

810
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,770
but no one knows what happened to him

811
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,820
when he was studying in South Korea.

812
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,380
He told the university
he had a car accident

813
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,940
and disappeared for half a year.

814
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,300
He was supposed to

815
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,340
study abroad after coming back,

816
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,700
but he suddenly changed his mind,

817
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,820
and his teachers and classmates

818
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,860
were so surprised.

819
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,460
Later,

820
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,860
his mentor recommended

821
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,060
a big company for him,

822
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,980
but he refused it

823
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,620
and chose

824
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,060
Bao Chenyan's small company.

825
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,300
You think something happened to him
in South Korea, right?

826
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,020
Well,

827
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,180
someone suddenly decides

828
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,940
to live a different life.

829
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,900
Something big must've happened.

830
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,150
Sister.

831
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,780
Sister.

832
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,100
Sister.

833
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,100
My hair!

834
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,260
Well,

835
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,700
are you surprised?

836
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,340
You made this?

837
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,140
I cooked it.

838
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,420
Listen, I got up at 5 a.m.

839
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,260
to fry eggs for you.

840
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,140
Look, I made a Chinese hamburger.

841
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,660
Why are you doing this?

842
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,780
What do you want?

843
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,620
Nothing.

844
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
Well,

845
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,580
I got up early

846
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,460
and made breakfast.

847
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,660
I'm a good brother, right?

848
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,500
Let's eat.

849
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,860
Don't want to say it?

850
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,100
Goodbye.

851
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,540
Sister, I'm not going to say anything,

852
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,380
okay?

853
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,380
I just want to talk about Bin.

854
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,500
Sister...

855
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,460
I think he's a good guy.

856
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,740
He's chased you

857
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,460
for so many years.

858
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,540
Please give him a chance.

859
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,460
Okay?

860
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,620
Say something.

861
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,780
Just give me an answer.

862
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,300
Sister.

863
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,260
Sister.

864
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,740
Perhaps

865
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,620
you can tell me why you don't like him.

866
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,340
I'll tell him to change, okay?

867
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,900
If you don't want to answer it,

868
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,460
at least give him a sign,

869
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,300
right?

870
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,340
Are you okay?

871
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,030
I'm fine.

872
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,300
My sister said you liked this perfume,

873
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,740
so I asked a friend to buy it in France.

874
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,820
Try it.

875
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,900
He's handsome

876
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,340
and funny.

877
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,580
What's the smell?

878
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,980
You broke the perfume?

879
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,660
- Injured?
- I'm going to work.

880
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,980
Sister, what about Bin?

881
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,820
If you're my brother,

882
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,860
don't talk about it again.

883
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,820
Mr. Xing, here's the info.

884
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,020
We investigated all the stores

885
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,380
that held the 5th-anniversary event

886
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,180
in Shenchuan at 8:29 p.m. that night

887
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,060
and have confirmed Heyue Supermarket
on Heliu Road.

888
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,100
Based on the surveillance
within the range

889
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,340
provided by Mr. Wu,

890
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,340
we've identified 19 cars.

891
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,700
We'll investigate them one by one.

892
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,860
(Registration Info)

893
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,180
Look.

894
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,460
How about this one?

895
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,380
I just got it.

896
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,860
It's good.

897
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,780
Let me try it.

898
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
You wish.

899
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,260
Listen,

900
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,820
in terms of skills,

901
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,900
Big Eye Chen is the best.

902
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,700
What a pity.

903
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,180
Who'd have thought

904
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,140
he'd end up

905
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,540
like this?

906
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,780
By the way, I saw
a video of him this morning.

907
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,880
Look.

908
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,120
Someone posted

909
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,280
the video of his race

910
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,620
online.

911
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,260
Hello.

912
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,420
Luo, are you with Bin?

913
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,780
I need to tell him something.

914
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,860
Why don't you just call him?

915
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,540
Bin,

916
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,380
we're not meant to be.

917
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,380
You will understand.

918
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,860
It's for the best.

919
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,620
(Da Pao)

920
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,300
This turn.

921
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,140
Didn't I tell you to call him?

922
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,940
Luo, well,

923
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,140
he didn't answer my call.

924
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,040
I'll tell you first.

925
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,880
Okay, tell me.

926
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,380
Well, it's not new information.

927
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,450
Didn't you say you were

928
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,560
looking for a motorcycle rider?

929
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,010
Bin sent me his photo.

930
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,110
I just saw someone

931
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,050
who looks like him,

932
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,620
so I followed him.

933
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,060
He entered the building,

934
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,520
and his motorcycle is here.

935
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,790
Where are you?

936
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,340
I need to tell you something.

937
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,460
Well,

938
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,650
the price for every piece of information

939
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,900
is 1000 yuan.

940
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,240
No problem.

941
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,300
Just send me the address.

942
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
Okay.

943
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,500
(No. 188, Xiangnanli Avenue)

944
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,780
(BRCB Yijia Road Branch)

945
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,580
What's wrong?

946
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,300
I've been calling you all afternoon.

947
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,260
What were you doing?

948
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,900
Healing emotional wounds.

949
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,180
What's wrong?

950
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,580
I gave Da Pao

951
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,260
1000 yuan for information.

952
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,020
1000 yuan.

953
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,140
He fooled you.

954
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,980
I'll ask him to give it back.

955
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,740
Keep healing yourself.

956
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,620
I'll take a look.

957
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,380
Hello, Luo. Where are you?

958
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,940
I'm almost there. What's wrong?

959
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,220
Don't come.

960
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,100
He just left.

961
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,620
Are you kidding me?

962
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,500
I'm almost there,

963
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,820
and he's gone?

964
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,580
Wait a minute.

965
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,020
Red motorcycle,
black leather jacket, and red helmet?

966
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,340
Yes.

967
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,780
The last two digits are 48.

968
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,540
Okay, go back. I saw it.

Go to the hotpot store in Siwei Tower.

972
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,300
I need to talk.

973
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,580
I'll take a bath first.

974
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,260
Okay, see you later.

975
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:24,730
Sister.

976
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,980
Why are you here?

977
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,820
What's going on?

978
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,100
Tianyi.

979
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,020
Give me your phone.

980
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,860
Are you crazy?

00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,420
Give me your phone.
I'll explain it later!

982
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,100
Are you out of your mind?

983
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,380
Tell me why!
