Goodbye.

Take care.

We're going.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,000

What are you doing?

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,560
How did you come here?

13

Why did you tear it?

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,160
Give it to me.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,800
I'm asking you why you tore it.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,080
What brought you here?

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,360
My parents are worried about you

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,960
and let me follow you and look after you.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,040
Why did you tear it?

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,080
I graduated first in my major

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
from JUFE.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,880
There are many high-paying jobs for me

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,000
to choose in Jiangzhou and Shenchuan.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,160

Not going.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
Then who is going?

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,440
Me?

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,760
I want to go. But can I go?

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,680
Do you know how much the fees are?

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,560
All the expenses are 50,000 yuan a year.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Our family can't afford that.

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,520
My sis and her husband are very tired.

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,600
I don't want them to be more tired

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
because of this matter and me.

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,240
No need to bother my dad and mom.

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,360
I've opened a few companies

38
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,800
and the business is doing well.

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,800
I knew it.

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,560
You and a group of brothers

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,400
risk your life to make a living.

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
Is it a business?

43

Uncle.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Listen to me.

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,240
This business

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,400
has to be like this...

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,600
What happened to your hand?

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Show me!

49
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,080
- Don't move.
- Be gentle.

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,320
That hand.

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,040
That hand.

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Is this the so-called business? Is it?

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,480
What kind of business is this?

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
Keep it down.

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,560
Sit.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,640
I didn't rob.

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,360
I didn't.

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,280
They compensated me this money.

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
This is compensation.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,160
If I didn't make it worse,

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,360
they wouldn't compensate me this much.

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,920
Do you understand?

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
This is the business.

64

Go ahead.

71
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,840
I have made new discoveries.

72
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,640
The financial manager of Guotai Group

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,480
frequently met with someone.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,520
This person seems to be Qi Hanchen's manager,

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
An Zhiqiang.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,840
thank you for the hard work.

and Qi Hanchen's companies.

87
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,280
for a joint case with ECD.

Well,

94

to see where

102
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,920
this money ultimately went.

Mr. Qi,

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm very anxious.

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,320
Let's meet.

108
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm discussing a project in Gang City.

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,640
I can't go back for now.

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,680
Isn't the Tuan Island Market important?

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,720
How can we talk without meeting?

112
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,320
You insisted on getting the management right

113
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
for Tuan Island.

114
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
I agreed.

115
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,120
Now there are issues with the operation.

116
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,560
Why do you tell me that?

117
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,400
On the matter of Tuan Island,

118
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,120
I am currently only doing two things.

119
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,960
One,

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,360
get the money I should have;

121
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,680
two,

122
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,680
arrange for personnel to investigate

123
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,760
your business performance

124
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,840
and management skills.

125
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,680
I am not responsible for anything else

126
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
and will not inquire about it.

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
This is the rule of the business game.

128
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,600
If you really don't understand this,

129
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,880
I can send someone over.

130
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,880
Mr. Qi,

131
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,160
we are on the same boat now.

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
Mr. Tu, Tu Manjiang,

133
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,080
has been hospitalized.

134
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Many accounts are unclear.

135
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
Think about it.

136
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,600
If the funding for Tuan Island

137
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,000
goes wrong,

138
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,920
are you happy?

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll ask Mr. An to go over.

140
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
First, check the accounts;

141
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,080
second, help you relieve the pressure.

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
How could An handle this?

143
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,000
Can he make the decisions?

144
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,280
Mr. An is an outstanding graduate.

145
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,130
Originally, this is a small matter.

146
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,980
He doesn't have to go at all.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,040
You told me there are difficulties now.

148
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,760
Moreover, it involves Xuan's company.

149
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,880
That's why I let him go.

150
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,720
On the Tuan Island project,

151
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,440
he can fully represent me.

152
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,680
Ok?

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,920
That's all.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,040
This person

155
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,000
is really good at acting.

156
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
It is a good thing.

157
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,720
The more he hides,

158
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,160
the more it indicates there is a problem.

159
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
Keep pressing him.

160
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,640
How could he be not back?

161
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
Hello?

162
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,720
Mr. Xing.

163
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,810
Hello.

164
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
I am discussing a project in Gang City.

165
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
What?

166
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,520
Is there something going on?

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,920
It's ok.

168
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,040
Gang City is not far away.

169
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
It's like this.

170
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,080
Please come back

171
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,520
as soon as possible.

172
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,960
But I am still discussing a project.

173
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,120
If the project fails, who is responsible?

174
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
There's a case

175
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
that might involve you.

176
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,200
I need to ask you about it.

177
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,480
What case?

178
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
Can't we discuss this over the phone?

179
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
A murder case occurred

180
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,080
at the Guanhai Tea House under your name.

181
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
According to our investigation,

182
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,240
the murderer has a close relationship

183
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,310
with the staff

184
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,360
at this tea house.

185
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
So,

186
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,200
you need to be questioned.

187
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,240
This tea house is an investment of mine.

188
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,360
But I am not responsible for it.

189
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,960
If you want to know the details,

190
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,160
I can arrange for the person in charge

191
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,560
to connect with you.

192
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,040
We have already informed

193
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,480
the person in charge of Guanhai Tea House,

194
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,360
An Zhiqiang.

195
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,720
Coincidentally,

196
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,670
he is also very busy.

197
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,840
He is discussing projects outside

198
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,800
and doesn't have time either.

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,120
But it's ok.

200
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,320
I have already called you.

201
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,920
If I can't see you in person tomorrow,

202
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,640
then we will send a notification

203
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,160
to the Guanhai Tea House

204
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,560
and your company's headquarters.

205
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Mr. Xing, you're really anxious.

206
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,000
Fine.

207
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,400
I'll arrive at noon tomorrow.

208
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
What about An Zhiqiang?

209
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,800
If

210
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,600
he keeps refusing to be questioned,

211
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,680
we will have to directly summon him.

212
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,840
The nature will be different.

213
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
He will go with me.

214
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,440
Please come in.

215
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Ms. Wen, I found out.

216
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Ok, thank you.

(Wen's Tuan Island Trading Co., Ltd.)

220
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,080
Mr. An.

221
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Ok.

222
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
I've seen it.

223
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
Just say

224
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
what you want to say.

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,280
The company's minority shareholders

226
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,900
pledged their equity for commercial loans.

227
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
We need to focus on risk prevention.

228
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,280
If there are issues with their loans,

229
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,960
the project will encounter problems.

230
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,640
As the main company,

231
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,360
we need to bear joint and several risks.

232
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,600
Aren't you just looking for trouble?

233
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,960
Mr. Man has already told us

234
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,880
this project uses

235
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
your financial license.

236
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,040
If any problems occur,

237
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,120
it is your responsibility.

238
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
So crazy.

239
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,520
You don't understand at all.

240
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,000
Then let me give you a good lesson.

241
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,650
What you said

242
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,560
is a different matter.

243
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
But companies

244
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
only recognize contracts, not people.

245
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,430
You can now go

246
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,700
to check and see

247
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,800
if this financial company

248
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,350
has any connections with Morningstar Group

249
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,240
and Shenchuan Corporation,

250
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,920
and if there are overlapping shareholders.

251
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
If there isn't,

252
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,040
then don't get us involved.

253
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,280
We are all Chinese.

254
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,440
Do Chinese companies not take responsibility

255
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,040
when doing business with each other?

256
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
What a talent indeed!

257
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Look at you.

258
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,480
You have the same demeanor as that Qi.

259
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,080
I will look

260
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,040
into this matter.

261
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Ok.

262
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,040
Next time,

263
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,320
go directly to Mr. Man for anything.

264
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,560
He can still talk in the hospital.

265
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,610
Is that ok?

266
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,520
I don't want to see you.

267
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Seeing you annoys me.

268
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,040
Ok.

269
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,520
I hope

270
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,320
we meet as few times as possible.

271
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Bao.

272
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,600
Lie down.

273
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,520
Don't move.

274
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,600
Is Tao ok?

275
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,040
She's fine.

276
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
Man,

277
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,520
An, Mr. Qi's subordinate,

278
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,960
has been to the company.

279
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,680
He said

280
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,880
our company is facing

281
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,880
operational problems and risks.

282
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,600
What risks?

283
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Many small merchants

284
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,160
at Tuan Island Market

285
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,240
participated in the Make Money project.

286
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,080
If this project

287
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
has any issues,

288
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,680
he is worried

289
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,800
the equity we hold

290
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
might be taken by others.

291
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,840
This is impossible.

292
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,800
When they initially

293
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,920
lent us the license,

294
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,260
they conducted a qualification review

295
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,920
on both the company

296
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,800
and the financial loan project.

297
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,120
If there are any issues,

298
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,320
how could he possibly lend us the license?

299
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,720
So many merchants have participated.

300
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,440
Unlikely they all can't pay back the money.

301
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,640
Since they have checked,

302
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,200
we have to follow through.

303
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,640
You are not as detailed

304
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,040
in financial operations as I am,

305
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,640
so I will talk to them.

306
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,720
Man,

307
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,010
lie down.

308
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,080
Come on.

309
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,800
No rush.

310
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,400
Take care of your injury.

An Zhiqiang,

315
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
here's the thing.

316
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
A murder case occurred

317
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
at the Guanhai Tea House.

318
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,960
When we got the surveillance video,

319
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,480
they told us the monitor was broken.

320
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,600
What a coincidence.

321
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,080
I can not decide

322
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,000
when the monitor will be broken.

323
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,880
If you insist on holding

324
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,920
our tea house responsible,

325
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,280
I admit

326
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,720
that it is due to the negligence

327
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360
of the technical dept and the security dept.

328
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,960
But this monitor was broken

329
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,320
from the previous day.

330
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,320
It wasn't broken when the case occurred.

331
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,120
You can't say that a monitor issue

332
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,000
means this case is related to us.

333
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,520
By the way,

334
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,960
when the case occurred,

335
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,800
where were you?

336
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
What do you mean by that, officer?

337
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,720
I am indeed the person in charge.

338
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,720
Is this why you suspect me?

339
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
I am a boss after all.

340
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440

- Answer whatever I ask you.

- How is your relationship?

We are friends.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Yang.

Mr. Xing has something to attend to,

360

so he can't come.

Mr. Xing

362
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,720
is quite funny.

363
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,400
He personally made a phone call

364
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,320
and called me back from Gang City,

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,560
but he didn't show up himself.

366
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,920
Is he really busy

367
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,880
or...

368
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,480

369
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,600
and rushed over for a meeting,

370
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,830
- so...
- Ok.

371
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,240

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,360
Ms. Wen,

385
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
someone came to settle the accounts,

386
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,960
saying the money on the books is not enough.

387
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,040
That's impossible.

388
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,230
The money on the books is sufficient.

389
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,180
Most of the funds have been transferred

390
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,920
to the special account for Tuan Island project.

391
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,960
All the money was withdrawn this morning.

392
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,560
What about the remaining money?

393
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,170
The company's working capital

394
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,280
and daily reserves

395
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,120
have all been used up.

396
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,560
I understand.

397
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,560
You ask

398
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,760
the Procurement Dept

399
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,760
to delay for another two days.

400
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
I'll find a way.

401
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,960
Ok.

402
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,580
(Criminal Technical Team of Binjiang PSB)

403
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,140
(Xing Liang)
Mr. Qi.

404
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,440
(Binbin)
Look at you.

405
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,720
You don't have time to go to the company

406
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
but have time to drink tea here.

407
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,120
You're not good at doing business.

408
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,000
You are really good at performing.

409
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
Have you figured out the company's matters?

410
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,480
As for opening a company

411
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,360
and doing business,

412
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,000
I can never understand.

413
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,920
But I do understand one thing.

414
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,680
We are

415
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,160
partners

416
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,560
and friends.

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
What are you messing around with?

418
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
Since the agreement was signed,

419
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
I never made a single call,

420
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,120
nor asked about the progress.

421
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,320
The company is operated by you.

422
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,240
Now there are various issues,

423
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,440
but you are blaming me.

424
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,720
Qi Hanchen, I'm telling you,

425
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,670
we are now partners,

426
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,880
friends.

427
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
Isn't this your business?

428
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,160
Our nature is different.

429
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,840
Tuan Island is everything to you.

430
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,790
To me,

431
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,820
it's just a whim.

432
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,020
(In front of the Public Security Bureau)

433
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,280
It's the Public Security Bureau.

434
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
I've told you long ago

435
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,840
that with your level of education,

436
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,800
you can barely survive in the society

437
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,990
but you won't make it in this circle.

438
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,880
Broaden your perspective.

439
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,520
Do whatever you can do.

440
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,480
Don't mess around.

441
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,080
Play with finance like others?

442
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,120
You won't make it.

443
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,990
Bao.

444
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,360
- Bao.
- What are you doing?

445
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
Answer the phone.

446
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,680
Just kidding.

447
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,900
(In front of the Public Security Bureau)

448
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,360
Hello? Zixuan, what happened?

449
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
We were tricked by Lin Yisheng.

450
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,800
All the money has been transferred away.

451
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
They colluded from the very beginning

452
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,600
and used our relationship

453
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
to enter the Tuan Island project.

454
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,560
They put all of us in it.

455
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,280
I didn't manage the risks well.

456
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
It's fine.

457
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,550
Don't panic.

458
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,720
I'll be there soon.

459
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,160
Ok.

460
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,200
Go to Banshantang.

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,280
Lin Yisheng and Tu Manjiang

462
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,040
embezzled all the company's money.

463
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,990
I should have listened to you

464
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,280
and be wary of Tu Manjiang.

465
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,640
- Go to the hospital.
- Why?

466
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,160
I saw his condition wasn't right yesterday.

467
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,800
If the money is really gone,

468
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,480
there must be a problem with him.

469
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,600
Hello?

470
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
I came out of the Crime Investigation Unit

471
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,040
and ran into Bao Chenyan.

472
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,480
He should have received a call

473
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,320
from Wen Zixuan

474
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,360
and left in a hurry.

475
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
They probably have already found out.

476
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,720
Activate the backup plan.

477
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,120
No, no, no.

478
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,320
Excuse me.

479
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,440
I want to ask something.

480
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,320
Where did Tu Manjiang go?

481
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
He went to the dressing room.

482
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,360
Go.

483
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,180
Liu, is Tu Man Jiang inside?

484
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,080
He's inside.

485
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,500
(Dressing room)

486
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,800
How about you?

487
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,520
I've freed myself.

488
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
You can

489
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,680
start now.

490
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,120
Good.

491
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,320
We have already cut ties

492
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,420
with the financial company, right?

493
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,520
Yes, we have.

494
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,030
We have any relationship

495
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,200
with them no longer.

496
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,920
Ok.

497
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,640
Let's do this.

498
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
Arrange

499
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,600
for all relevant personnel

500
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,470
to be dismissed

501
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,360
and withdraw all funds.

502
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,280
Let Zhiqiang arrange for someone

503
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,600
to start collecting

504
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
the payment and logistics fees

505
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,480
from those merchants tomorrow.

506
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,000
We will report to the police

507
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,240
if they cannot pay us,

508
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,280
so that the police can back us up.

509
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,320
Ok.

510
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,120
He dared to play tricks on me today.

511
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,160
I'll teach this guy

512
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,760
how to survive in the civilized society.

513
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,280
What's the situation?

514
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,360
I have already contacted the bank

515
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,680
to freeze the funds.

516
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,480
They will recover it as soon as possible.

517
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,280
Have you already know something?

518
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
I have never asked

519
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
about your company's matters.

520
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,610
The ECD takes charge of financial cases.

521
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,560
We just cooperate with them.

522
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
What can I know?

523
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,050
Look me in the eye

524
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,440
and repeat what you just said.

525
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,800
We just sent someone

526
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,400
to investigate Guotai Group.

527
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
However, the specific situation

528
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,960
is still in the confidentiality stage.

529
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,960
I didn't ask you for the details.

530
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
At least tell me what case it is.

531
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,640
There is currently no direct evidence.

532
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
However,

533
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,080
the known information is

534
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,080
Guotai Group

535
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,880
is likely related to the fraud gang

536
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,760
in Huqing.

537
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,170
That's all.

538
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,280
Xing Liang, Xing Liang,

539
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,180
you clearly knew everything

540
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,240
but you watched me

541
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,510
jump into the trap.

542
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,960
We are disciplined.

543
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,650
The case under investigation

544
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,590
cannot be leaked.

545
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,480
How could I tell you?

546
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,980
You have become so absorbed in your position

547
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,490
that you don't even know who you are.

548
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,120
It is precisely because I know who I am,

549
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,560
then I must adhere to rules.

550
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,360
All right, Xing Liang,

551
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,280
I finally see

552
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,720
what kind of person you are.

553
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,160
Calm down a bit.

554
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,120
The case is still under investigation.

555
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
To take a step back,

556
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,000
even if that money can't be recovered,

557
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,400
my salary

558
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,840
can also support our family.

559
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,560
I am very calm now.

560
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,080
Listen carefully.

561
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,560
This is not the matter of money.

562
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
Since our family's businesses

563
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,200
are worthless to you,

564
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,320
fine,

565
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
we can go our separate ways.

566
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,840
Pay this month's payment for goods

567
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,760
and logistics costs.

568
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,720
Why has it been postponed by a month?

569
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,720
Me too.

570
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,520
Yesterday it could be withdrawn in a week,

571
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,440
but now it has changed to a month.

572
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,280
Yeah.

573
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,400
It could be withdrawn immediately back then.

574
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,920
Why is it taking longer and longer?

575
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,000
I've invested all my savings

576
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
and even mortgaged this shop.

577
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,240
What should we do now?

578
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,600
Hurry up and make the call.

579
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,630
Give Bao a call.

580
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,800
Let me give him a call.

581
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,120
Quick, make the call.

582
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,680
Hello? Bao.

583
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,480
The neighbors have all invested their money

584
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,920
into the Make Money financing project.

585
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,800
But we just found out the money

586
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,040
can only be withdrawn after one month.

587
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,320
Logistics and warehousing fees

588
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,360
are all waiting to get paid now.

589
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,520
What should we do?

590
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,990
Didn't they say that the money

591
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,440
can be withdrawn anytime and anywhere?

592
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,080
How could it be a month?

593
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,640
It used to be like this.

594
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,080
Later, the cycle gets longer and longer.

595
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,680
It's getting harder to withdraw the money.

596
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,840
Now we can't withdraw it at all.

597
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,800
Please find a way.

598
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,360
What should we do?

599
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,160
Let everyone calm down first.

600
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,320
I'll ask them about it.

601
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,880
Ok.

602
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,600
- What did Bao say?
- What did you say?

603
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,720
Bao said he will handle it.

604
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,640
Do not be anxious.

605
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,800
How could we not be anxious?

606
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,560
My money is in it.

607
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,440
We can only listen to Bao now.

608
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,080
Qi Hanchen

609
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,560
let me discuss something with you.

610
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,560
All these merchants

611
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,080
in Tuan Island

612
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,760
are honest people.

613
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,040
What they do is a small business.

614
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,240
You have a big business.

615
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,440
Give them a break,

616
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,720
ok?

617
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,360
Have you figured out the situation?

618
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,320
When I initially supplied them,

619
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,600
it was already agreed upon.

620
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,280
First,

621
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,580
the price is very favorable;

622
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,760
second,

623
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,760
they can defer payments for 10 days.

624
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,610
I have fulfilled my promise.

625
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,400
I am now

626
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,080
collecting payments

627
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,760
according to the agreement.

628
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,440
It's their responsibility if they fail to pay.

629
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,760
What does this have to do with me?

630
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,500
Moreover, I've said it before

631
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,090
we are doing business,

632
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,800
not doing charity.

633
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,620
By the way,

634
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,100
I'm giving you

635
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,400
a friendly reminder.

636
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,280
If they can't make the payment,

637
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I can only use legal means

638
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,000
to protect my legitimate interests

639
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,840
and collect their shops

640
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,000
according to the mortgage terms.

641
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,760
Qi Hanchen,

642
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,720
you are really ruthless.

643
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,200
You are really something!

644
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,400
All right?

645
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,480
How about this?

646
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,200
I will pay off all the debts

647
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
of these merchants.

648
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,120
I just ask you

649
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
to give me a few days' grace.

650
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,680
Do me this favor.

651
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Mr. Bao,

652
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,520
oh no,

653
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Bao,

654
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,200
you are really a person

655
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,320
who values loyalty.

656
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,280
I will definitely do you this favor.

657
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,170
Three days.

658
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,390
By then I want to see the money.

659
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,130
Hurry up.

660
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,960
Binbin.

661
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,370
Binbin,

662
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,800
listen clearly.

663
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,320
Go to the finance department now

664
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,240
and withdraw 500,000 yuan

665
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,800
to cover all the merchants' debts

666
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,840
first.

667
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,780
Ok, I'm going now.

668
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
Bin,

669
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,880
there's no money in the account.

670
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,720
Impossible!

671
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,760
There was over eight million this morning.

672
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,960
Bin,

673
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,280
this money is the project deposit

674
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,560
mortgaged to the bank.

675
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,360
It appears on the books but we can't use it.

676
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,760
How much cash flow do we have now?

677
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,600
- Check it out.
- Ok.

678
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,320
Bin, take a look.

679
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,700
(Transaction details inquiry)

680
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,120
Hello? Binbin,

681
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,480
what's the situation?

682
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,320
The company is out of money.

683
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,680
Tu Manjiang transferred all the money away.

684
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,760
Is it possible to recover it?

685
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
It is a shell company.

686
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,520
He should have planned it.

687
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
We can't recover it.

688
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
Ok, I got it.

689
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,360
Has the money

690
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,440
been laundered abroad?

691
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,320
Sheng,

692
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,080
you have to leave quickly.

693
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,400
I am in the dark

694
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,560
while you are in the light.

695
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,760
The money has been laundered now.

696
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,280
Bao won't let you go.

697
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,920
The police will not let you go either.

698
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,800
It's too dangerous for you to be here.

699
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,360
How about this?

700
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,560
You go abroad immediately

701
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,720
to avoid the trouble.

702
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,280
Come back after this period is over.

703
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,640
How about you going with me?

704
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,400
I can't leave.

705
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,760
I still have very important things

706
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
that I haven't finished.

707
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,840
What important things?

708
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,240
Bao,

709
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,120
there is one thing...

710
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,120
I believe you.

711
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,330
Then I ask you directly.

712
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,830
Go ahead.

713
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,480
Did you introduce that mistress

714
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,440
to Big Eye Chen?

715
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,210
So strange.

716
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,300
Xing Liang asked me about it.

717
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,140
You also ask me.

718
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,680
What does his mistress

719
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,000
have to do with me?

720
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,120
Do I really have to know?

721
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,040
It's really quite strange.

722
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,360
You should know

723
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,120
Tao is watching me very closely.

724
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,440
I don't have other women.

725
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,680
Tao's friends said

726
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,360
they've seen you at a drinking party.

727
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,360
They sent me photos.

728
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,920
These girls all look quite similar.

729
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
All look familiar.

730
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,200
Which one?

731
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,280
The second one over here.

732
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,400
I definitely have seen her before.

733
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,720
Is her name

734
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,960
Hui?

735
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,120
Have you seen her or not?

736
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,050
Are you familiar with her?

737
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,200
Make it clear.

738
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,560
How should I put it...

739
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,280
I remember now.

740
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,680
I've seen her.

741
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,820
And I have even talked to her.

742
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,840
Once upon a time,

743
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,640
many of us played together.

744
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
I remember I saw her with

745
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,080
Man.

746
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,280
Man and she

747
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,320
sat on the sofa

748
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,280
at the innermost part

749
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,400
of the private room.

750
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,680
They had a great time chatting.

751
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,640
I joked at that time

752
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,680
and said, "Man,

753
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,040
you guys chat so happily,

754
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,280
why not take her home?"

755
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,320
Tu Manjiang?

756
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,320
Right.

757
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,200
Tu Manjiang.

758
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,160
What are you doing?

759
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,960
I am really a fool!

760
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,440
That's such a big flaw,

761
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,560
such an obvious thing.

762
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,680
But I didn't expect that.

763
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,800
From the time I lost my gun

764
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,440
then to Big Eye Chen attempting suicide,

765
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,080
and now to the money being transferred away,

766
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,960
one thing after another,

767
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,680
which one can avoid him?

768
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,800
Bao!

769
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,000
Bao!

770
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,070
The merchants are arguing downstairs.

771
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,120
Hurry up and take a look.

772
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,240
Speak louder. Louder.

773
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,680
Speak louder. Louder.

774
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,760
Did you not eat?

775
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,760
Be quiet.

776
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,840
Bao is here.

777
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,480
Can't you speak nicely?

778
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,120
Why come here to make a scene?

779
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,000
Bao,

780
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,680
we all invested the money

781
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,000
because we believed in you,

782
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
but now we can't withdraw it,

783
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,160
we have no choice but to come to you.

784
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,000
Right.

785
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,120
Right.

786
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,120
Bao,

787
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,160
you have to give us an explanation.

788
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,720
You can't ignore us.

789
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,920
Hui, you are bold.

790
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,120
You dare to cause trouble too.

791
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,440
No, no.

792
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,240
Bao, Bao,

793
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,400
all of our money

794
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,080
didn't come from nowhere;

795
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,770
that money is the hard-earned money

796
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,880
we saved over the years.

797
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,000
But we can't withdraw it suddenly.

798
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,130
You have to give us an explanation, right?

799
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,470
Yeah, yeah, what should we do?

800
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,440
It's all our hard-earned money.

801
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,960
Are you still going to make a scene?

802
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,880
You were deceived, and so did I.

803
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,400
Have I ever told you

804
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,840
that I don't care if you are deceived?

805
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:42,960
Have I ever said it or not?

806
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,440
No, no, no.

807
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,480
I will help you get back all the money

808
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,680
you were cheated out of.

809
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,040
I promise.

810
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,870
If I can't get it back...

811
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,760
The company is located here.

812
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,840
You can move the things as you like.

813
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,360
- Is it ok?
- No, no.

814
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,280
Let's do this.

815
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Like this,

816
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,480
stand in a line.

817
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,840
Think carefully about the amount

818
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,720
and register it clearly and accurately.

819
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
- Is it ok?
- Ok, ok.

820
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,880
Let's listen to Bao.

821
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,200
Yes, yes, yes.

822
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,160
Wu.

823
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,200
Everyone, stay calm.

824
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,720
Line up behind me in order.

825
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,650
All right.

826
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,610
Come on.

827
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,960
Don't block the road.

828
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,960
Go up, go up.

829
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,200
- Honey, be careful.
- Be careful.

830
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,140
Be careful.

831
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,080
Tu Manjiang is driving us to death.

832
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,680
He wants to play?

833
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,360
Just play with him.

834
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,360
We're out of money.

835
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,640
How?

836
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,880
Sis.

837
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,720
Bao.

838
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,040
How's the situation?

839
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,480
I calculated the situation of the merchants.

840
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,020
There's a shortfall of more than six million.

841
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,520
The funds of my company

842
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,640
have all been taken away.

843
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
It's all my fault for being too greedy.

844
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,600
Nonsense.

845
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,640
What does this have to do with you?

846
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,440
The most important thing now

847
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,040
is to cover the money of Qi

848
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,320
and these merchants.

849
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,800
My company has no money on the books.

850
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,640
My own cash

851
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,760
is also too lacking.

852
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,400
I am thinking

853
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,240
if there's no other way,

854
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,960
I will pledge the company to the bank.

855
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,000
This is not enough either.

856
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,200
I have already pledged the company.

857
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,280
I think it should be no problem

858
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,480
for all of us to contribute a little.

859
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,560
Xuan,

860
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
in general online scams,

861
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,960
they quickly funnel the victim's money

862
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,480
into different accounts,

863
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,160
and then transfer it through these accounts

864
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,910
into online companies

865
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,850
invested by the main company.

866
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,320
And this company

867
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,120
does not belong to the scam gang.

868
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,430
This is a very complete

869
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,960
money laundering chain.

870
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,920
The Make Money project

871
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,920
that you are doing

872
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,400
have similar operations.

873
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,920
Most importantly...

874
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,160
What is it?

875
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,240
Say it.

876
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
The case is still unresolved.

877
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,200
I can't say.

878
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,560
You watch your own family members

879
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,280
jump into a pit that someone has dug

880
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,680
without saying a word

881
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,840
or showing any reaction.

882
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,560
No wonder you can achieve great things.

883
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,800
Xuan, you should understand my work.

884
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,760
Bao.

885
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,520
When Lin Yisheng was running that project,

886
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,340
I just felt something wrong,

887
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,580
(Guotai Group)
but

888
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
I looked into his background

889
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,320
which is very clean.

890
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,800
No issues could be found.

891
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,840
So I downloaded this app,

892
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,840
transferred some money into it

893
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,000
and traced the flow of funds

894
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,400
to find the final account.

895
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,080
I also asked a friend.

896
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,800
This account belongs

897
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,930
to a financial company in Huqing,

898
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,480
well,

899
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,640
which is not affiliated with Guotai Group.

900
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
But the Lin's is one of the shareholders.

901
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,690
What kind of company is this anyway?

902
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,560
On the surface,

903
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,860
there is very little valid information.

904
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,080
It seems to have no business activity.

905
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,080
However, its risk warning

906
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,200
has nearly 100 items.

907
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,880
Moreover, it was rumored online

908
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,760
that it is

909
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,560
actually a loan shark company

910
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,960
disguised as a legitimate business.

911
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,360
When I discovered

912
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,730
that the special funds

913
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,580
allocated for the Tuan Island project

914
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,720
were transferred under the guise of investment,

915
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,120
I suddenly realized

916
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,280
Lin Yisheng didn't have good intentions

917
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,800
from the very beginning.

918
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,520
He knew very well

919
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,280
that I was eager to find an external force

920
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,920
to fight against Qi Hanchen,

921
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,800
so he took the initiative to approach me.

922
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,400
The current situation is

923
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,680
that Lin Yisheng is in the light

924
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,040
while Tu Manjiang is in the dark.

925
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,040
Qi Hanchen is fanning the flames.

926
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,800
What a big game!

927
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,880
Now Tu Manjiang has disappeared.

928
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,320
But Lin Yisheng is still around.

929
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,680
So this money

930
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,120
is either in his hands

931
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,080
or in Qi Hanchen's hands.

932
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,920
The resolution

933
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,400
of this case

934
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,000
still depends on the police.

935
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,200
I just thought of a way

936
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,920
that might help us

937
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,920
get some money.

938
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,560
Bao...

939
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,640
I'll walk you out.

940
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,360
Liang,

941
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,800
the mistress of Big Eye Chen

942
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,040
was not introduced by Bao.

943
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
Hui and Tu Manjiang know each other.

944
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,320
They are very familiar.

945
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,360
I think

946
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,320
Bao should have been set up by someone.

947
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,740
Behind everything,

948
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,040
there is Tu Manjiang.

949
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,360
It seems

950
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
he should be the mastermind behind it.

951
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,640
Even if he's not,

952
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,360
he is very close to the mastermind.

953
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:40,061
♪The moon is surrounded by stars♪

954
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:44,491
