00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,580
(Eight years ago)

2
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,480
Bao,

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,040
if you ask me,

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,840
we shouldn't fight anymore.

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
I've been working at this pier
for over twenty years.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,380
I want to leave it for my brothers

7
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,000
so they can make a living.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,040
Is that too much to ask?

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,360
Dian Lao'er,

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,680
making a living is not too much.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,400
You know that.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,200
Many of my vendors
at the Tuan Island market

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,240
are buying seafood from your place

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,120
at a 30% higher price.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,480
What's going on?

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,360
Is this true?

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,040
No.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,440
Did you hear that, Bao?

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,600
If it's true,

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,120
it's just some careless brothers.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,320
I'll make sure

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,960
to teach them a lesson later.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
From today,

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,720
the vendors from Tuan Island

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,920
should buy seafood from your place

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,920
at the same price.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,920
If you agree,

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,680
then it's settled.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,000
If you don't agree,

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,540
I'm going to make trouble for you today.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,200
I agree.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,440
Do you know
why they call me Dian Lao'er?

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Because

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,160
I don't want

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,440
to risk my life

36
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,240
for the position of the boss.
[*Lao'er: second]

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,920
So,

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,440
I've come out unscathed

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,960
after twenty years here.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,520
From now on,

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,960
whatever you want to do,

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,620
I'll go along with it.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,640
Let's go home.

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,580
Where's my game console?

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
Let's go.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,580
=Black&White Forest=

47
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,540
=Episode 13=

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
First it was Bao.

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,760
Then it was me.

50
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,960
It went from Binjiang to Ninghai,
and then back to Binjiang.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
After a big circle,

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,680
it's back to the same place.

53
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,760
Why?

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,080
What do you think?

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
For the Tuan Island.

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
Really?

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
Do you have concrete evidence,

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
or is it just speculation?

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
Both.

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
You're worried about my sister too.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
You know my sister's temper.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,860
Once she makes a decision,

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
no one can change it.

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,320
That's why

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,200
I came to see you.

66
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,540
What?

67
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,780
I can't convince her. Don't count on me.

68
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,180
Listen to me.

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,660
I have an idea.

70
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,180
I need you

71
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,380
to cooperate.

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,100
Do you think this plan is feasible?

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
No.

74
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,660
But for Xuan,

75
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,300
I still want to try.

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,420
For my sister,

77
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,820
we have to try.

78
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,100
Okay then. It's settled.

79
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm not doing this for you.

80
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,340
I'm doing it for my sister.

81
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,220
Right, right.

82
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,500
Okay, see you tomorrow night.

83
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,700
Don't forget.

84
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,700
Working with you?

85
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,660
I'm already exhausted.

86
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,020
Debts must be paid.

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,940
It's a must.

88
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,900
Debts must be paid.

89
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,120
It's a must.

90
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,880
Debts must be paid.

91
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,380
It's a must.

92
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,380
Debts must be paid.

93
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,860
It's a must.

94
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,900
You two are ruthless.

95
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,180
Can you turn the volume down a bit?

96
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,700
Debts must be paid.

97
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,060
It's a must.

98
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,390
Debts must be paid.

99
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,500
Debts must be paid.

100
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,620
Lao'er.

101
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,070
The brothers are all ready.

102
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,180
I've arranged people

103
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,590
around the hospital.

104
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,460
Are they going with us too?

105
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,780
Don't mind them.

106
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,500
They're crazy.

107
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,500
It's a must.

108
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,340
Debts must be paid.

109
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,820
It's a must.

110
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,870
Come on, Yong.

111
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,910
- Come on.
- Mr. Xing.

112
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,820
Sit, sit.

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,130
Luo's Steamed Vermicelli Roll.

114
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,850
Their business is booming.

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,630
- Thanks.
- I queued for over 30 min.

116
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,160
How's it going?

117
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,500
I wasted the whole night.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,420
I went through

119
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,300
all the CCTV footage
from the crime scene

120
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,180
as Bin described.

121
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,780
I didn't find anything.

122
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,540
They must have come prepared.

123
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,660
Where's Fei Zai? Here.

124
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,200
He's watching Dian Lao'er.

125
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,020
By the way, Mr. Xing,

126
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,980
Mr. Tai said you need to report to him

127
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,900
about the full-scale surveillance,

128
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,980
otherwise...

129
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,300
Otherwise,

130
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,080
I'll be held accountable?

131
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Yeah.

132
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,260
Okay, I know.

133
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,580
Bao,

134
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,300
for you to meet me today,

135
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,300
you've given me a chance.

136
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,540
Thank you.

137
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,060
I'll apologize to you.

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,540
You have to pay for this wine.

139
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,140
What are you doing?

140
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,380
Why are you drinking wine for no reason?

141
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,700
What do you mean?

142
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,580
I, Dian Lao'er,

143
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,860
have made a mistake.

144
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,220
I admit it.

145
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,260
If I get hit,

146
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,660
I'll stand straight.

147
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,300
Lao'er,

148
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,420
why are you apologizing to me?

149
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,820
Let me explain.

150
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,220
I found out

151
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,700
about the situation at the pier.

152
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,740
I really don't know

153
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,020
the person who stabbed you,

154
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,580
but he did hide at my pier.

155
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,100
I'm responsible for this.

156
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,820
I made a mistake.

157
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,820
I owe you an apology.

158
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,660
Are you saying

159
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,620
you don't know

160
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,460
the person who stabbed me?

161
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,020
If I knew him,

162
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,980
would I dare to meet you today?

163
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,140
I know you very well.

164
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,420
You can't do anything,

165
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,700
but you're bold.

166
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,900
Right?

167
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,620
Look at yourself here.

168
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,160
You're meeting with me,

169
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,860
but you brought two bodyguards.

170
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,180
Is there anything in this world
you're afraid of?

171
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,180
You mean these two?

172
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,060
Bro.

173
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,180
Let me introduce them.

174
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,500
These two

175
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,940
are the brothers

176
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,590
of the shooter from Birkin Paris.

177
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,700
It's their brother

178
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,500
who shot at me, right?

179
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,780
Their brother was caught.

180
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
They said it was my responsibility,

181
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,620
and I must pay

182
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,220
one million.

183
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,920
You don't have that kind of money.

184
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,580
Boss.

185
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,300
My brother is one thing,

186
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,940
but we're the other thing.

187
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,460
Your grudge with my brother

188
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,660
has nothing to do with us.

189
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,820
Besides, he's already been caught,

190
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,180
probably going to be executed.

191
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,810
If you have a grudge,
he'll pay with his life,

192
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,620
right?

193
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,180
Did I tell you to speak?

194
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,900
Debts must be paid.

195
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,420
It's a must.

196
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,340
Debts must be paid.

197
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,380
Do you still want money?

198
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,300
It's a must.

199
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
Debts...

200
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,020
Does this happen every day?

201
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
How pathetic, bro.

202
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,900
Dian Lao'er.

203
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,830
I'm also curious.

204
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Why is everyone saying

205
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,660
they're related to you?

206
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,660
Bad luck.

207
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,540
They have their mouths.

208
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,460
What can I do?

209
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,180
True.

210
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,060
Today,

211
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,340
are you here to apologize to me?

212
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,940
Good.

213
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,380
Dian Lao'er,

214
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,060
I have only one condition.

215
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,820
Just withdraw

216
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,020
from the Tuan Island

217
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,770
bidding team.

218
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,700
Then the stabs you did to me,

219
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,180
from this moment on,

220
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,520
will have nothing to do with you.

221
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,380
Are you saying

222
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,290
if I withdraw
from the Tuan Island project,

223
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,820
it's all settled?

224
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,140
But if I withdraw,

225
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,860
I'll lose my shares.

226
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,100
Yes.

227
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,580
If I lose my shares,

228
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,260
I'll lose my money.

229
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,740
That's your problem then.

230
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,940
Without money,

231
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,300
how can I give them what I owe?

232
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,180
If I don't have money for them,

233
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,020
they're going to kill me.

234
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,700
Then, I'll have no shares

235
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,500
or money,

236
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,220
and I'll be gone.

237
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,060
You don't want me alive?

238
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,540
Fine.

239
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
Come on then.

240
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,780
No one should live.

241
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,660
Everyone can just die!

242
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,860
Dian Lao'er, you better behave.

243
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,340
- Put it down.
- Show some respect.

244
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,380
Lao'er, are you alright?

245
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,020
Bao, are you okay?

246
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,180
Dian Lao'er,

247
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,740
I know you have big dreams.

248
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,020
You've always wanted

249
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,260
to take Tuan Island from me.

250
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,940
Today's a perfect opportunity for you.

251
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,420
If you kill me,

252
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,100
your wish

253
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,020
will come true.

254
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,060
Come on.

255
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,740
Come on!

256
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,940
You all saw it.

257
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,820
I didn't move.

258
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,980
I didn't do anything.

259
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,140
Bao,

260
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,380
let's keep things above board.

261
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,100
We'll talk again

262
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,140
at the Xingyu Pier.

263
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,140
When you're feeling better,

264
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
I'll make sure

265
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,860
you still live here.

266
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,520
Step aside.

267
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,400
Come here.

268
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,420
Come here.

269
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,380
Don't move.

270
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,540
Let's go.

271
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,260
Debts must be paid.

272
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,820
It's a must.

273
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,860
Debts must be paid.

274
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,700
It's a must.

275
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,460
(Binjiang Public Security Bureau;
Director's Office)

276
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,780
Come in.

277
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,820
Tell me. What's going on?

278
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,140
I'm still busy.

279
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,660
The Provincial Department

280
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,620
gave me another week.

281
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,000
We'll still handle it ourselves.

282
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,580
Alright, that's it.

283
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,860
Go back.

284
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,020
Aren't you busy?

285
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,720
What else do you need?

286
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,580
What are you looking for?

287
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,140
Where's my police ID?

288
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,980
I think it was here yesterday.

289
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
Acting.

290
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,710
Keep acting.

291
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,630
Don't disturb me.

292
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,560
Can you check if it's with you?

293
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,170
Look in your drawer.

294
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,540
You're unbelievable.

295
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,340
Come on.

296
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,380
What do you need

297
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,740
my police ID for?

298
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,940
Seriously.

299
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,780
Xing Liang,

300
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,220
you're really shameless.

301
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,900
Who's shameless?

302
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,660
You're only two years younger

303
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,240
than the guys in the dorm,

304
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,380
but you always act spoiled.

305
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,020
Just spoil yourself for life.

306
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,070
How am I acting spoiled?

307
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,520
Steamed vermicelli rolls
from Luo's place.

308
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,360
Do you want it?

309
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,470
Are you trading

310
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,860
steamed vermicelli rolls
for your police ID?

311
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,640
I can't believe you thought of that.

312
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,820
Alright, you won't eat, so I...

313
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,640
Who said I won't eat?

314
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,490
Did I say that?

315
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,180
Continue being tough.

316
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,010
Hurry up and go back.

317
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,900
Why haven't you touched these fruits?

318
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,220
I'll take them for the brothers.

319
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,620
- Bye.
- Don't stuff yourself.

320
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,100
Where are the chopsticks?

321
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,460
Why are you making dumplings?

322
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,660
Xuan, you're back.

323
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,420
If you want to eat,
ask the cook to make it.

324
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,000
If not, you can order takeout.

325
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,680
The cook is also from the South.

326
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,050
She can't quite make

327
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,060
the kind of dumplings we have
in Beijing.

328
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,180
I'll help you.

329
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,420
No need. Wash your hands.

330
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,260
It'll be ready soon.

331
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,500
Did you make the filling?

332
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,740
I learned it from a video online.

333
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,980
It looks right.

334
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,090
Did you add water?

335
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,180
I'll add it now.

336
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,000
- That's not what I meant.
- How many times?

337
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,060
When I say add water,

338
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,540
I mean you should pour cold water in,

339
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,380
not stick your finger in.

340
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,940
- What's going on?
- I'll do it.

341
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,020
Add cold water.

342
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,760
That's how you add water, see?

343
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,420
Alright, it's done. You can keep it.

344
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,260
You can use it later.

345
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,780
Are you really okay?

346
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,880
- I'm fine.
- Let me see.

347
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,780
I'm fine. I'm fine.

348
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,660
It's all red.

349
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,570
You're really something.

350
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,260
OK, I'll remember next time.

351
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,980
I should pour some cold water.

352
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,820
I remember.

353
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,500
When I was in school,

354
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,920
you'd come to find me on weekends.

355
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,380
We couldn't afford much food.

356
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,970
A senior ran a dumpling shop

357
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,030
right downstairs.

358
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,840
I often took you there to eat.

359
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,020
What's it called?

360
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,330
Changfa Dumpling Shop.

361
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,300
At first,
I thought it was called Changfa

362
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,900
because he liked rock music.

363
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,500
I thought it was so romantic.

364
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,520
But later, I found out

365
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,620
it's "Fa" as in "prosper".

366
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,020
Guess what his last name is?

367
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,380
Is it Sun?

368
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,220
It's Jia.

369
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,420
Jia Changfa.

370
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,020
It always seemed lively,

371
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,900
with lots of our juniors
going there to eat.

372
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,740
We never paid.

373
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,820
So, when graduation came,

374
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
the shop closed down.

375
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,480
Just as the name suggested.
[*Jia: fake]

376
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,740
- Changfa.
- Those were the good days.

377
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,580
Yeah.

378
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,420
I wasn't used to eating dumplings,

379
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,620
but you guys made me learn
to love them.

380
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,500
But I only eat this filling.

381
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,460
This tastes good.

382
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,900
All these years,

383
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,700
you've really worked hard.

384
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,660
It's just like eating dumplings, right?

385
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,180
You get used to it.

386
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,660
You need to balance family and work.

387
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,220
In the future,

388
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,020
don't exhaust yourself

389
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,060
at work.

390
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,440
Next time you want dumplings,
just tell me.

391
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,200
I'm at least better than you
at making them.

392
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,820
Look, it's standing up now.

393
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,660
I can make it stand up too.

394
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,300
Have a try.

395
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,940
It looks quite good

396
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,620
after cooking.

397
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,020
Try this filling.

398
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,700
Sis.

399
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,340
You're good at picking the right time.

400
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,740
It's perfect for eating dumplings.

401
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,020
I was worried you didn't like dumplings,

402
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,300
so I even ordered takeout.

403
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,900
Do you know
Liang made the dumplings today?

404
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,060
- Of course.
- No.

405
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,180
You two are up to something.

406
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,000
No, nothing.

407
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,830
If something's off,
there's always a reason.

408
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,880
I won't buy your little tricks.

409
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,980
What could possibly be wrong?

410
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,180
It's just a family meal.

411
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,860
Besides,

412
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,260
you've always taken care of us.

413
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,340
When there's a problem,

414
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,060
the most important thing is you.

415
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,020
Right.

416
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,260
It's because of the Tuan Island project,
right?

417
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,780
No need to make such a big deal of it.

418
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,300
I told you.

419
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,540
This whole dumpling nostalgia thing

420
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,540
wouldn't work.

421
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,680
Can't you just stick
to the plan for once?

422
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,180
Why did you bring takeout?

423
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,020
I...

424
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,860
I'll be straightforward.

425
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,780
I don't agree with your participation
in the Tuan Island project.

426
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,020
You have no say in this.

427
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,220
The money is in my hands.

428
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,260
Well...

429
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,180
My room's window opens with a push.

430
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,080
You've always liked

431
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,700
threatening us with suicide
since little.

432
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,580
Hurry up and go.

433
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,660
If you say that,

434
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,900
then I'll go even further.

435
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,540
I heard what Dad said

436
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,380
before he passed.

437
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,020
He wanted you to watch me
start a family to continue

438
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,980
the family bloodline.

439
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,420
If you don't withdraw,

440
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,020
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow
and get sterilized.

441
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,500
I didn't know that.

442
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,700
Sterilized, huh?

443
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,420
Do you think you can scare me?

444
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,220
You don't even have a girlfriend.

445
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,060
Do you think
your sterilization will scare me?

446
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,060
I've never counted on you.

447
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,800
Your brother-in-law can try his best.

448
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,500
Our future kids can use my surname.

449
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,460
Don't joke about sterilization!

450
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,220
What about Bao?

451
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,360
Bao also advised me.

452
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
He also wants you to withdraw.

453
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,540
He feels the same as we do.

454
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,180
The most important thing is your safety.

455
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,340
He came to see me yesterday,

456
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,740
but I refused.

457
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,100
Why do you have to do
this Tuan Island project?

458
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,020
I didn't choose the project.

459
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,620
The project chose me.

460
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,420
You two are the police.

461
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,380
Bao is a gangster.

462
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,860
Only I'm a pure businessman.

463
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,580
So for me,

464
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,100
Tuan Island is just

465
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,580
a crucial business opportunity.

466
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,220
Do you think

467
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,720
it's easy to run the family business

468
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,320
that Dad left?

469
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,040
Why don't you think about it
when you are using money?

470
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,080
Have you ever asked
about how my company's doing?

471
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,980
Have you ever cared?

472
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,720
You know

473
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,020
the situation with the company.

474
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,260
Do I have other options?

475
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,140
Tuan Island is the best one.

476
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,980
No.

477
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,020
Xuan,

478
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,600
the Tuan Island project

479
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,980
is too dangerous for you.

480
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,300
I don't agree either.

481
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,080
At worst, just give up on this industry.

482
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,700
We can all go back to Hugang.

483
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,180
We won't starve to death.

484
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,420
I understand your worries.

485
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,780
I'll think it over carefully.

486
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,340
At least you've eased up a bit.

487
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,180
The sterilization thing I said

488
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,020
did work.

489
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,140
Can't food block your mouth?

490
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,100
Don't joke about sterilization.

491
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,140
Alright.

492
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,420
Don't get angry.

493
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,780
Then, eat this.

494
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,220
I love dumplings.

495
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,060
Your sister loves
Jia Changfa's dumplings.

496
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,220
Who?

497
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,300
After Dad passed,

498
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,260
this is the first time

499
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,020
we've talked about the family business

500
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,460
at this table, right?

501
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,900
(Binjiang Public Security Bureau)

502
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:05,340
(Remote Transmission;
Other users' computers and phones)

503
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,660
(Binjiang Public Security Bureau)

504
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,940
I just received evidence

505
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,700
about Dian Lao'er's connection
with Wu Ajin.

506
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,300
You contact Fei Zai now.

507
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,340
Arrest them on the spot.

508
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,540
Dian Lao'er

509
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,500
is indeed connected to the dead killer.

510
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,980
Now, go to his house.

511
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,060
Take him down immediately.

512
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,700
Who is it?

513
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,220
What are you doing?

514
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,340
- Where's Dian Lao'er?
- What's going on?

515
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,260
Don't move.

516
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,140
Don't move.

517
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,500
Where's Dian Lao'er?

518
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,620
It's 7:30 PM, Beijing time.

519
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,980
What's going on, Lao'er?

520
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,020
Why are you so quiet?

521
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,860
I...

522
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,580
Didn't you hear my footsteps?

523
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,500
The code.

524
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,100
What's the code?

525
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,860
I forgot.

526
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,100
Erhuang.

527
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,030
- Woof, woof?
- Yeah.

528
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,060
You scared me.

529
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,980
- Where's the medicine?
- It's here.

530
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
I'll get it for you.

531
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,780
Slow down.

532
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,420
Come on.

533
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,020
Lao'er.

534
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,860
Something's wrong.

535
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,980
There's a strange smell.

536
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,300
It's your feet.

537
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,300
Lao'er.

538
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,740
How long are we gonna hide?

539
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,740
Stop your nonsense.

540
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,820
Lao'er.

541
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,580
Didn't you tell the cops?

542
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,880
They know what's going on now.

543
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,020
I can't explain.

544
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,220
Lao'er.

545
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,200
Those two crazy dogs

546
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,420
are looking for us everywhere.

547
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,460
How long do you think we can hide?

548
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,380
Alright, alright.

549
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,900
I know what I'm doing.

550
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,620
Hurry up and get the bed ready.

551
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,660
I'll stay here for a few days.

552
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,180
Did you get my clothes?

553
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,160
Everything's here.

554
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,860
Bao.

555
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,180
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

556
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,840
Bao.

557
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,780
What's going on today?

558
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,580
Whose birthday is it?
There's even a cake.

559
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,740
Today is a happy day.

560
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,780
Of course, we need a cake.

561
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,380
It's all about the sense of ritual.

562
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,820
- Let's drink.
- Come on.

563
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,000
The nurse will be here soon.

564
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,260
Come on, let's drink.

565
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,100
Come on.

566
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,860
Have a beverage.

567
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,180
I want to drink wine.

568
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,500
You can't.

569
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,600
Your injuries aren't healed.
How can you drink?

570
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,500
Do you know

571
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,660
how hard it was

572
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,860
to get Tao to leave just now?

573
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,240
I just wanted to drink.

574
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,540
These past few days,

575
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,780
so many things haven't gone right.

576
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,000
Let me drink a little.

577
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,820
Don't try to persuade me. Don't nag me.

578
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,140
Of course, Bao said to drink.

579
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,360
- Slow down.
- Don't touch Bao's drink.

580
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

581
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,180
That's great.

582
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,110
If it weren't for those two jerks,

583
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,780
I would've caught Dian Lao'er.

584
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,860
Don't worry.

585
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,700
We'll catch him sooner or later.

586
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,900
As for the Tuan Island project,

587
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,220
our only competitor

588
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,620
has run away.

589
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,740
He's out of the game.

590
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,100
Let's celebrate in advance.

591
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,460
Another drink.

592
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,340
Come on.

593
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,260
For the Tuan Island project,

594
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,180
you've all worked hard,

595
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,420
but who's worked the hardest?

596
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,190
It's Man.

597
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,860
No, I haven't.

598
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,800
You're being too polite.

599
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,900
Come on, let's drink.

600
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,540
Let's drink.

601
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,500
Let's drink. Come on.

602
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Come on.

603
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,100
Man,

604
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,180
are you tired?

605
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,460
Thank you for your hard work.

606
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,980
Not hard at all.

607
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,180
Bin helped me a lot.

608
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,500
I didn't know before.

609
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,460
Bin's good

610
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,620
at business.

611
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,260
Of course. Don't you know

612
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,680
who Bin's father is?

613
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,350
Like father like son.

614
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,050
He's Mr. Wen's son.

615
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,390
How could he be bad at business?

616
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,010
Right?

617
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
But Bin,

618
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,270
you're always running around,
never sitting still.

619
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,820
Business is a good choice for you.

620
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,100
No.

621
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,300
I just want to learn more things.

622
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,720
Bin's not young anymore.

623
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,080
Bin should be more sensible now.

624
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,820
Plus, this project used to be

625
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,900
the Wen family's business.

626
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,260
Bin should learn
how to manage the business.

627
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,260
That's great.

628
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,100
Yeah.

629
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,300
What are you doing?

630
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900
Who told you to drink here?

631
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,340
Why shush? Get out.

632
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,460
Take your stuff and leave.

633
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,700
Do you know you're a patient?

634
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,540
Give me the wine.

635
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,700
Take your stuff and get out.

636
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,780
Let's go, let's go.

637
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,900
- Get out.
- Okay.

638
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,260
Take your stuff and get out.

639
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,380
- Take it with you.
- Leave it here.

640
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,300
Give me the wine.

641
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,960
Give me it.

642
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,420
Have you forgotten you're a patient?

643
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,060
Rest well.

644
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,840
- Get out.
- You go first.

645
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,180
Bao, we're leaving.

646
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,380
You're really something.

647
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,420
You always show up
right on time for meals.

648
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,110
Why the cake today?

649
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,740
I was wondering what's missing.

650
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,280
I know my sister the best.

651
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,580
I thought we needed a cake,

652
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,780
so I made a detour to buy it.

653
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,800
You're thoughtful.

654
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
Come on, sit down.

655
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,880
We agreed.

656
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,020
Today, the three of us

657
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,020
are just going to have a quiet meal.

658
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,380
Don't give me any more surprises.

659
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,920
I'll go first.

660
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,380
(Turn off)

661
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,350
Alright, the phone's off now.

662
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,380
Xuan, this was a work phone.

663
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,220
I couldn't...

664
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,100
Yeah,

665
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,940
but that's the difference
between people.

666
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,060
Stop taunting your brother-in-law.

667
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,660
If I wasn't in a good mood,

668
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,780
I wouldn't tolerate you.

669
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,700
Our competitor has disappeared,

670
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,440
and the Tuan Island project
is practically settled now.

671
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,780
Shall we have a toast first?

672
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,430
Sis, this is to you.

673
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,800
As soon as you joined
the Tuan Island project,

674
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,060
Dian Lao'er, the troublemaker,

675
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,580
backed out.

676
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,600
You're our lucky star.

677
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,700
You're not hitting the mark

678
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,340
with your flattery.

679
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,740
If we were granting merits,

680
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,860
your brother-in-law
would be ahead of me.

681
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,620
So, isn't your first drink

682
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,220
supposed to be to your brother-in-law?

683
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,940
This first drink should be to you.

684
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,460
You and my sister will have
a second child.

685
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,020
That's the most important.

686
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,860
Aren't you going to get sterilized?

687
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,860
I ran into Aunt Feng

688
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,450
from the old military district.

689
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,380
- Do you remember her?
- Yeah.

690
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,460
Her younger son is
about the same age as Bin, right?

691
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,380
Her grandson's already been born.

692
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,220
This wine doesn't taste quite right.

693
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,700
I'll go see if there's anything else.

694
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,500
You'd better hide.

695
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,700
And you.

696
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,500
Shouldn't you put in more effort?

697
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,870
Are we really going to have
a second child?

698
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,500
I'm talking about Bin's work.

699
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,100
With him like this,

700
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,220
how's he going to date?

701
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,220
You're worrying over nothing.

702
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,500
He's already seeing someone.

703
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,700
What are you talking about?

704
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,180
Na Fan is both beautiful and capable.

705
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,620
Given Bin's current situation,

706
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,100
how could I possibly bring it up?

707
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,620
I don't care.

708
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,180
Anyway, you caused this situation.

709
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,180
You handle it.

710
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,500
I got it.

711
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,860
Mr. Qi.

712
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,580
A big boss like you

713
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,780
is willing to invest
in our little place.

714
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,300
It's our honor.

715
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,420
Not at all.

716
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,760
(Director Xu)
Do you have

717
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,340
(Dawan District Investment Bureau)
any specific project in mind?

718
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
This area

719
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,300
is part of the Dawan District plan,

720
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,860
with unlimited potential

721
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,940
and resources.

722
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,020
After careful evaluation, our company

723
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
unanimously believes

724
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,820
that the Tuan Island
upgrade project is great.

725
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
It has a good location,

726
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,100
high foot traffic,

727
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,980
and a solid base of original vendors.

728
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,420
It has great potential for growth.

729
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,460
Mr. Qi, you're truly
a great businessman,

730
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,120
with foresight and courage.

731
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,460
(Mr. Wang from Dawan)
Not at all.

732
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,180
I believe, with your strength,

733
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,100
this vision will definitely come true.

734
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,300
- Cheers.
- Welcome, Mr. Qi.

735
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,020
Thank you, thank you.

736
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,740
May the Tuan Island project
succeed soon.

737
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,300
Boss.

738
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,820
Dian Lao'er's call.

739
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,380
Hello?

740
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,940
Mr. Qi.

741
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,460
Any news

742
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,260
about Uncle Long?

743
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,220
It's all set.

744
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,260
He'll come soon.

745
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,620
Okay.

746
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,020
Given your current situation,

747
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,740
many things are inconvenient
for you to handle,

748
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,820
but the Tuan Island project

749
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,020
must continue.

750
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,020
The bidding is about to start.
It can't stop.

751
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,380
Here's the plan.

752
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,020
You sign a transfer agreement

753
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,140
and hand over your shares of Tuan Island

754
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,620
and your company's shares

755
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,020
to me to handle.

756
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,300
I'll send someone
to continue this project.

757
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,820
I've caused

758
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,460
a lot of trouble for this.

759
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,740
Now you're abandoning me,

760
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,220
and you want to take my company?

761
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,580
I'm telling you.

762
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,740
Don't even think about it.

763
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,980
Are you sure
you want to speak to me like this?

764
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,660
No, no.

765
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,140
I didn't mean that.

766
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,980
I just got a bit flustered.

767
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,060
I was wrong, bro,

768
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,900
I was wrong.

769
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
You know.

770
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,040
I've put everything on the line

771
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,860
for this project.

772
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,180
You can't just abandon me.

773
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,420
What's yours will still be yours.

774
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,140
I'm just sending someone else
to take care of things.

775
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,100
Okay, okay.

776
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,900
I'll do as you say.

777
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,420
Lao'er,

778
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,500
is everything okay?

779
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,740
I hope so.

780
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,380
Get the relevant documents ready.

781
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,220
We need to get

782
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,620
his Tuan Island shares

783
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,980
and his company's shares.

784
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,020
Why Dian Lao'er's company shares?

785
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,300
We used his company's name for the bid.

786
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,580
With his current condition,

787
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,980
he's a time bomb.

788
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,020
He can't be

789
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,440
on the company's shareholder list.

790
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,940
Dian Lao'er's a veteran in the game.

791
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,720
Do we really need
to deal with this trouble?

792
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,420
It's business.

793
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,580
Trouble is inevitable.

794
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,060
When trouble comes, we can solve it.

795
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,260
If it can't be solved,

796
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,220
then we'll make
the troublemaker disappear.

797
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,640
My sister is probably
going through menopause.

798
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,540
She worries about everything.

799
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,300
Just appease her a bit

800
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,620
and let her relax.

801
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,760
Do you really think you're a detective?

802
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,560
Aren't you also in a rush
to find the gun?

803
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,980
So now,

804
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,100
you're not in a hurry?

805
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,220
Of course, I'm in a hurry.

806
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,880
But what's the use of that?

807
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,140
Unless you tell me something.

808
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,020
If we catch Dian Lao'er,

809
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,860
things still won't end, right?

810
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,260
After all this trouble,

811
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,020
was it all just

812
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,460
for Dian Lao'er?

813
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,740
That's what I think too.

814
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,740
They took the gun

815
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,500
and only made a move two months later.

816
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,340
I don't think this is
the result they want.

817
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,420
One thing is certain.

818
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,780
Aside from the obvious

819
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
Tuan Island project,

820
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,260
there must be something else

821
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,660
we haven't discovered.

822
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,060
And it has to be a big deal.

823
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,620
Any leads?

824
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,460
We have to find Dian Lao'er.

825
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,580
Maybe we can find a clue from him.

826
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,900
(Chen Mingyuan/Dian Lao'er)

827
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,180
Xing,

828
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,060
we've investigated
Dian Lao'er's finances.

829
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
We've found something.

830
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,100
A fund company

831
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,540
invested in Dian Lao'er's company

832
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,560
(Transaction History)
shortly after the initiation

833
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,660
of the Tuan Island project.

834
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,660
Also,

835
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,500
that company has gotten a small portion

836
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,100
of the Tuan Island shares

837
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,940
from the periphery.

838
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,860
What's the background of this company?

839
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,020
The main investor is from Gang City.

840
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,100
His record is clean.

841
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,420
No issue has been found.

842
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,340
This might be

843
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,500
the white glove

844
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,100
they intentionally put on the surface.

845
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,860
Datou?

846
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,740
Datou?

847
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,340
Where is he?

848
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,580
Where did he go?

849
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,460
I'm starving to death here.

850
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,900
Hey, hey.

851
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,490
What are you doing?

852
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,320
You've been looking for food for ages.

853
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,460
I've searched this room so many times.

854
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,420
There's only this bag
of instant noodles left.

855
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,620
Come on.

856
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,540
How long are we supposed to wait
before we can go home?

857
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,920
We haven't gotten the money.

858
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,300
How can we go home?

859
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,540
Then we need better food.

860
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,260
I haven't had meat in three days.

861
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,820
Let me tell you.
If you don't give me some meat,

862
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,460
you'll have to drag my dead body
back home.

863
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,170
What better food?

864
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,120
We spent all the money to get here.

865
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,880
If you have meat this time,

866
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,860
what can we eat later?

867
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,200
I don't care.

868
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,060
If you don't give me meat,

869
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,540
I'm quitting.

870
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,210
What are you doing?

871
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,970
I'm telling you.

872
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,220
You asked for this.

873
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:36,900
Keep making a fuss,

874
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,470
and I'll throw you out, got it?

875
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,870
Where are you going?

876
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,070
Oh, my.

877
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,220
I didn't think of that.

878
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,020
Your brain

879
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,010
finally worked for once.

880
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,620
This big dog's great.

881
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,380
Lao'er, drink it.

882
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,380
Alright.

883
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,780
This temporary escape command center
is set up.

884
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,060
Bro,

885
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,580
how'd you find this place?

886
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,500
Why are you here?

887
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,700
Where did you come from?

888
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,790
Little dog.

889
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,640
Come here, come here.

890
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,900
