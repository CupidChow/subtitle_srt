3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,440
Boss.

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,120
Bin found the killer.

5
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,800
Where is this?

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,640
Xingyu Pier.

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,440
Report to Mr. Xing.

8
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,400
I'll apply for surveillance.

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,440
- He won't get away.
- Okay.

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,360
What?

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,440
Why are you texting them?

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,840
Didn't I tell you

13
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
they were not reliable?

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
But they have more means

15
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
to catch criminals.

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,480
Besides, Bao told us

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
to catch him

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
at all costs.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Fine.

20
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
What about now?

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
It's over.

22
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,920
Come on, I'll buy you late-night snacks.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,880
What? Snacks?

24
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,530
Mr. Wang,

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,080
is this all we've got?

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,690
Yes, here's all the surveillance

27
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,390
of Xingyu Pier.

28
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,020
Thanks.

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,660
It weird.

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,380
Where can he go?

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,060
Did he drown in the sea?

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,760
Liu Yong.

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
Look,

34
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,860
the surveillance of Xingyu Pier

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,940
can cover a big area,

36
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,700
but some remote paths

37
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,540
can't be seen.

38
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,500
What about the local

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,340
police station?

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,340
They're out

41
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,220
searching for him.

42
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,950
Who's this?

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,340
It's so early.

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,720
Take it! It's so annoying!

45
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,580
Hello.

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,700
Dian Lao'er,

47
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,220
how dare you play dirty?

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,220
Bao?

49
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,460
I have bad news.

50
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm still alive.

51
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,700
How do you want to play?

52
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,540
I sent a killer?

53
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,340
Why would I do that?

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,540
How's that possible?

55
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,340
Bao, I'll be honest with you.

56
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,100
Someone else is trying to kill me!

57
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,620
I'm in danger!

58
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,500
I'll give you a chance

59
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,340
to get over here

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,660
and explain everything.

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,940
Otherwise,

62
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
I'll see you

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,740
in the crematorium.

64
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,260
Okay! Come on!

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,700
Don't be a coward!

66
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm not scared!

67
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,940
Come on!

68
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,180
And you, and you!

69
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,340
All of you!

70
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,540
Let's go to hell together!

71
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,700
Is he crazy?

72
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,820
Tianyi,

73
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,500
gather our people.

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,260
Arrange it!

75
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,030
Bao.

76
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,260
It's not negotiable.

77
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,860
That's it.

78
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,180
How's that possible?

79
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,860
I can't stop you,

80
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,900
but my sister can.

81
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,380
If you really get into a fight,

82
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,300
what about your business?

83
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,860
What about the project?

84
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,340
Binbin,

85
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,020
think about it.

86
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,740
No one has dared

87
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
touch me all these years.

88
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,740
After I participated

89
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,700
the bidding project
of Tuan Island Market,

90
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,860
I was stabbed.

91
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,020
It doesn't matter.

92
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,340
What if someone wants

93
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,060
to kill Zixuan?

94
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,180
I'm so scared.

95
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,900
Sir.

96
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,020
What's so urgent?

97
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,740
You have a package.

98
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
It requires your signature.

99
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,060
My signature?

100
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,900
Yes.

101
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,140
Sir, here's your package.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Please sign your name.

103
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,980
Here.

104
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,180
(Reception)

105
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,260
Who sent this?

106
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,580
I don't know. The sender is anonymous.

107
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,140
Didn't you see the person?

108
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,060
No, I picked it up
from the delivery locker.

109
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,340
Did you sign it?

110
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,420
Okay. Thanks.

111
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
Pen!

112
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,500
Sorry.

113
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,500
My sister told me

114
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,500
Xing Liang also asked her

115
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,260
to quit the project.

116
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,220
Xing Liang

117
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,300
finally did the right thing.

118
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,100
I think he was right.

119
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,820
I've found a new investor

120
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,740
from Haicheng.

121
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,780
My sister rejected it.

122
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,580
She said we're family.

123
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,020
You need a hand.

124
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,100
She has to help you.

125
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,900
Binbin.

126
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,420
I think the project
of Tuan Island Market

127
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,460
and the attack

128
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,140
are not that simple.

129
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,100
I'm afraid

130
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,340
the person behind this

131
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,420
has a bigger plan.

132
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,100
Anyway, now

133
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,700
you,

134
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,180
my sister,

135
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,820
Xing Liang,

136
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,020
and me

137
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,740
are all involved in this.

138
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,540
So, none of us

139
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,420
can deal with it alone.

140
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,300
I've told Xing Liang

141
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,140
about the pier...

142
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,070
I think he was right.

143
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,420
It's okay

144
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,340
to do whatever it takes

145
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,860
to solve the problem.

146
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,260
It doesn't matter if it

147
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,580
breaks the rule.

148
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,500
We've got an anonymous ally.

149
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,860
I've been

150
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,060
wondering

151
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,340
why he helped us.

152
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,940
Liu Yong,

153
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,780
ask for assistance.

154
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,980
Find this car.

155
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,140
Okay.

156
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,900
Fei Zai, track back

157
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,580
to the city delivery company.

158
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,820
Ask the police station to help us

159
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,820
find more details.

160
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,540
- Got it.
- You can go.

161
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,100
Shouldn't we gather our people?

162
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,620
I'm still on it.

163
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,100
Why are we going to the police station?

164
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,460
You're silly. Don't deny it.

165
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,180
I thought you were going to
find a place to kill time.

166
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,580
Gather our people?

167
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,220
Bao was pissed off.

168
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,380
Don't take it seriously.

169
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,620
Then...

170
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,580
why are we

171
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,020
going to the police station?

172
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
Follow them.

173
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,660
If we want to solve this,

174
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,220
we'll need their help.

175
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,540
So many enemies.

176
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,020
Hurry up.

177
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,860
Pay back the money.

178
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,020
Don't let us come here for nothing,

179
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,340
okay?

180
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,900
Dear friends,

181
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,260
I will pay you back.

182
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,220
Then give us the money.

183
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,900
But I don't have money.

184
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,220
Are you fooling us?

185
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,580
If you hurt me, I won't pay you back.

186
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,900
Can you stop wasting time?

187
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,180
I'll pay you back in a month,

188
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,580
okay?

189
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,780
But now

190
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,820
someone wants to kill me.

191
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,260
You have to protect me.

192
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,580
Otherwise,

193
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,620
you'll only get paper money.

194
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,460
Fine.

195
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,820
We can protect you

196
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,140
when you're not in danger.

197
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,140
If you're in danger...

198
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,420
If I'm in danger,

199
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,420
I'll make sure

200
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,100
you go to hell with me.

201
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,220
Where are you going?

202
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,260
Take a dump.

203
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
Want to join me?

204
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,540
Wait. Put your phone down.

205
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,140
Mr. Xing, we found it.

206
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,180
The deserted factory.

207
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,140
Unfinished building?

208
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,090
Yes.

209
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,020
Inform the SWAT. We're going.

210
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,180
Okay.

211
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Call our people.

212
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,700
Why?

213
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,900
They're all going out.

214
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,820
It must be serious.

215
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,180
We're working on the same thing.

216
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,700
Hello.

217
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,740
Hello.

218
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,220
Mr. Qi.

219
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,300
You finally answered my call.

220
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,620
Thank god.

221
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,500
Can you do me a favor?

222
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,220
Can you

223
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,020
give me 1 million yuan to save my life?

224
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,020
I called Chen and Minister An,

225
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,740
but they didn't answer.

226
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,780
Can you talk to them?

227
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,900
We had a deal.

228
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,340
I'll give you the money

229
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,180
when we succeed.

230
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,220
It's not my obligation or responsibility

231
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,620
to give you what you want.

232
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,460
Mr. Qi,

233
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
I've worked

234
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,380
so hard for you.

235
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,820
Please help me one last time.

236
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,940
As you know,

237
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,980
the Suns are pushing me

238
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,460
to pay them back.

239
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,900
Bao wants to kill me.

240
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Don't worry.

241
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,220
I won't sell you out.

242
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,580
I'll definitely

243
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,460
take the blame for you.

244
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,820
Take the blame for me?

245
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,820
We're friends, right?

246
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,420
You don't have to lie.

247
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,220
Didn't you send

248
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,780
the man to stab Bao?

249
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,940
I'll be honest with you.

250
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,540
He told me

251
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,060
you asked him

252
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,140
to give me a hand.

253
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,020
Dian Lao'er.

254
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,260
I'm a real businessman.

255
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,220
I can use money.

256
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,020
Why would I hire a killer?

257
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,980
What? You...

258
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,660
In that case...

259
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,380
Well,

260
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,940
I won't take the blame

261
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,420
for stabbing Bao.

262
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,780
Well,

263
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,100
can you

264
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,340
lend 1 million yuan?

265
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,620
I'll pay you back

266
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,380
after I talk to Uncle Long.

267
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,620
There's no other way.

268
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,540
The Suns

269
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,380
are pushing me so hard.

270
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,620
I have no choice.

271
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,780
Do you know

272
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,620
why I chose you?

273
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,740
Because you were a psycho

274
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,460
who feared nothing.

275
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,140
Now you're a coward.

276
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,660
You're not crazy.

277
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
You can't help me anymore.

278
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,860
Do you think you're useful to me?

279
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,740
I've told you

280
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,500
I'm a businessman.

281
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
Therefore,

282
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,660
I won't waste my money

283
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,620
on a useless thing.

284
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,740
Boss.

285
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
Shall we

286
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,740
deal with Dian Lao'er?

287
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,500
After all,

288
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,820
the project is still inviting bids.

289
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,300
If Dian Lao'er is dead,

290
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,430
we...

291
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,020
It's an opportunity.

292
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,020
Tuan Island project

293
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,220
is worth nearly 4 billion yuan.

294
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,900
It's not a game for a nasty person

295
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,100
like Dian Lao'er.

296
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,780
I used him

297
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,220
because I had no choice.

298
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,140
Before the bid opening,

299
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,740
we must kick him out.

300
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,980
This is good for us.

301
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,100
We don't need to waste time
getting rid of him.

302
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,820
Tell Chen,

303
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,300
don't give a penny to Dian Lao'er.

304
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,700
Okay.

305
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,700
But who will deal with the project

306
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,140
on behalf of us?

307
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,860
Prepare the legal

308
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,980
and financial documents.

309
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,420
It's time

310
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,100
for me to deal with it.

311
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,390
Boss,

312
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,580
it's not a big project.

313
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,620
You don't have to do this.

314
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,060
The Qi Family and the Wen Family

315
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,910
have a history.

316
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,340
Tuan Island

317
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,540
has always been Old Master's regret.

318
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,260
He put up with it,

319
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,740
but I won't.

320
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,380
Liu Yong.

321
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,060
Take our men in

322
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,580
through the north gate.

323
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,300
Okay.

324
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,180
Captain Wu,

325
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,380
my people will go in
through the north gate.

326
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,690
Your men will surround the building

327
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,560
from the west and east sides.

328
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,710
We have to succeed.

329
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,730
Got it.

330
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,620
Halt!

331
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,020
I think they found him.

332
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,340
Wait for our backup.

333
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,940
They'll get in. We'll wait outside.

334
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,020
How's it going?

335
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,260
They got in

336
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,580
but haven't caught him.

337
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,340
Shall we get in?

338
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,540
Don't make trouble.

339
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,140
Look, tell our people to split

340
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
and watch the junctions.

341
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,100
They're trying to catch him,

342
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,540
and we'll make sure he can't escape.

343
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,460
Go.

344
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,740
How's it going?

345
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,580
Mr. Xing,

346
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,860
no suspicious person.

347
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,900
Expand the search area.

348
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,180
Expand the search area.

349
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,620
Mr. Xing, we spotted
the suspect in the southeast.

350
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,460
Wow.

351
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,140
I just found out

352
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,380
he raised a duck and a chicken
in the birdcage.

353
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,180
He's so funny.

354
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,820
Bro, bro.

355
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,700
Look at him.

356
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,420
He looks like an idiot.

357
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
A month is not enough.

358
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,180
He can't even get the money in a year.

359
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,060
It's simple.

360
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,500
Sell his car and house.

361
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,820
We'll find a way, right?

362
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,980
Absolutely.

363
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,180
Idiot.

364
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,420
What the hell?

365
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,300
Where did he come from?

366
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,460
Look at you.

367
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,940
You've never won a fight,

368
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,900
but you keep fighting.

369
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
What's wrong with you?

370
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,700
It's my duty.

371
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,380
After all, I want to go back to work.

372
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,860
When you recover,

373
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,860
I will ask the doctor
to check your brain.

374
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
It's my duty.

375
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,060
Fine.

376
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,910
I...

377
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,860
It hurts.

378
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,180
Sister,

379
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,540
shall we quit the project?

380
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,700
Xing Liang was right.

381
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,980
It's too complicated.

382
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,940
I'll think about it.

383
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,820
Mind your own business.

384
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,060
Don't teach me.

385
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,980
Pay back the money.

386
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,380
Pay back the money.

387
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,780
Absolutely.

388
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,460
Pay back the money.

389
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,780
Absolutely.

390
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,140
Pay back the money.

391
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,500
Didn't I promise to pay you back?

392
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,580
Can you stop

393
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,820
torturing me?

394
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,980
What the hell?

395
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,500
Then pay us back.

396
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,780
Give us the money.

397
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,100
Hello.

398
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,020
Dead?

399
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,780
At this point,

400
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,460
don't fight with Bao Chenyan.

401
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,980
Don't forget our goal.

402
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,580
Okay.

403
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,460
I got it.

404
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,020
Can I ask you

405
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,060
who took

406
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,900
this order?

407
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,700
It was quick

408
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,260
and clean.

409
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,340
Boss.

410
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,180
How's it going?

411
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,460
We've got all the bidding documents,

412
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,180
but Dian Lao'er didn't contribute much

413
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,170
to the project.

414
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,250
He only got a 0.2 percent share

415
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,460
from a small shareholder.

416
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,140
So useless.

417
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,900
We can't count on him.

418
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Organize the relevant documents now.

419
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,820
We're ready to take over.

420
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,860
Okay.

421
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,780
No matter who did it,

422
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,500
I'm glad he's dead.

423
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,620
Hello.

424
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,700
I want to order a bouquet.

425
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,960
The bigger, the better.

426
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,350
Pay back the money.

427
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,780
Absolutely.

428
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,140
Pay back the money.

429
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,500
Absolutely.

430
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,580
Pay back the money.

431
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,180
- Absolutely.
- You...

432
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,380
Pay back the money.

433
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,020
- So annoying!
- Absolutely.

434
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,140
Pay back the money.

435
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,100
Absolutely.

436
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,830
- Pay back the money.
- Absolutely.

437
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,780
I have a real AK-47,

438
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,060
I'll teach you a lesson!

439
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,300
Get out!

440
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,180
Get out!

441
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,540
I want to see Binbin!

442
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,020
Don't you understand?

443
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,140
You haven't recovered?

444
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,180
What can you do?

445
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,580
Lie down!

446
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,260
Ms. Wen is with him.

447
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,700
He'll be fine.

448
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,660
Bao.

449
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,460
The killer died right after you called

450
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,780
Dian Lao'er.

451
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,780
Is it too coincidental?

452
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,300
What do you mean?

453
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,340
Go ahead.

454
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,580
I think there are

455
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,860
two possibilities.

456
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,060
First,

457
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,820
Dian Lao'er

458
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,460
hired the killer,

459
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,140
and he suddenly died,

460
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,300
which means someone
is also against Dian Lao'er.

461
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,820
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

462
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,180
It's good for us.

463
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,100
Second,

464
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,180
Dian Lao'er didn't hire the killer,

465
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,940
which mean

466
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,100
someone is behind all this.

467
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,260
It's dangerous for us.

468
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,060
No matter who they are,

469
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,980
they only want Tuan Island.

470
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,940
Absolutely.

471
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,620
Man.

472
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,380
Has Ms. Wen's company

473
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,540
finished

474
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,140
capital injection?

475
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,900
Not yet.

476
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,940
Wait. Bao, what do you mean?

477
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,100
Are you going to
terminate the cooperation?

478
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,940
It's too risky.

479
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,600
If we can't get an investment
from Haicheng,

480
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,180
we'll be in trouble.

481
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,020
We'll lose

482
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,180
the project completely.

483
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,020
Man,

484
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,940
Ms. Wen's company can't invest

485
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
in this project.

486
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,100
What?

487
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,060
As you know,

488
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,220
Binbin

489
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,940
and Zixuan

490
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,020
are like

491
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,060
my family.

492
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,020
If

493
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,420
I can't protect my family,

494
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,340
what's the point of doing business?

495
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,980
We can terminate the cooperation,

496
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,060
but we have to find a way.

497
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,500
We can't lose the project.

498
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,580
We've spent all our money

499
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,500
on this,

500
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,260
including mortgage loans
and bridge loans.

501
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,980
If anything goes wrong,

502
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,420
there'll be a capital chain rupture.

503
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,460
When the gun was lost,

504
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,700
you promised

505
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,620
to take care of it,

506
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,140
right?

507
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,320
I gave you two months.

508
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,660
And?

509
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,540
You still haven't found it.

510
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,660
Now you're persuading me

511
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,260
to give you more time.

512
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,820
How much time do you need?

513
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,740
How many lives

514
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,260
do you want to lose?

515
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,620
I'm fully responsible.

516
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,780
How can you be responsible?

517
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,810
What can you do?

518
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,860
Can you afford the consequences?

519
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,980
I want you to bring them back to life.

520
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,020
Can you do it?

521
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,500
I want you to solve the case.

522
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,580
Can you do it?

523
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,420
I can't.

524
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,940
But I'll bear all the consequences.

525
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
What do you mean?

526
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,980
Quiet quitting?

527
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,580
Do you want to give up trying?

528
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,620
Xing Liang, what do you mean?

529
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,420
Xing Liang!

530
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,540
What are you doing?

531
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,820
Listen, don't give me that sad face.

532
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,660
You're aggrieved.

533
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm more aggrieved than you!

534
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,540
I was scolded by Provincial Department.

535
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,020
I became the joke
of the colleagues in other cities.

536
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,620
The steering group

537
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,660
wants to take over the case.

538
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,100
I'm the one who's humiliated!

539
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,140
- What can I do?
- You...

540
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,820
Do you think I want this?

541
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,060
Why are you yelling?

542
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,900
Who the hell are you?

543
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,700
You're a cop!

544
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,260
You have to solve this case!

545
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,220
You always take the moral high ground.

546
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,020
Why don't you solve it?

547
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,540
Solve it or quit your job!

548
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,140
(Police Identity Card)

549
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,660
Hello, are you Mr. Bao Chenyan?

550
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,220
What's the matter?

551
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,340
Flowers delivery.

552
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,060
Man.

553
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,340
Who send the flowers?

554
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,980
(Get well soon. Dian Lao'er)

555
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,900
Dian Lao'er?

556
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,540
Why would he do it?

557
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,340
I think

558
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,500
he wants to make peace.

559
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,340
If he wants to start a fight,

560
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,620
I'll kill him.

561
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,460
Bao, we can't make it worse.

562
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,700
If he really wants to make peace,

563
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,600
it must be for the Tuan Island project.

564
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,980
Our interests are aligned.

565
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,380
At this point,

566
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,740
we must stay calm.

567
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,860
We can make peace

568
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,340
with him.

569
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,220
Tell him,

570
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,340
he needs to meet me in person.

571
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,780
I'll tell Tianyi to gather our brothers.

572
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,340
If he wants to make peace,

573
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,780
we'll pretend to accept it.

574
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,340
However, if he makes trouble,

575
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,060
we'll kill him.

576
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,260
Man.

577
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,500
Come on.

578
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,660
Look at you.

579
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,260
You're an educated man,

580
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,380
but now

581
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,740
you're mixing business

582
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,020
with killing.

583
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
Who stays with wolves

584
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,380
will learn to howl.

585
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,800
Be careful. Be careful.

586
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,660
This case is complicated. I...

587
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,580
I know what you're thinking.

588
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,940
It's the most important case right now.

589
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,500
You have to do whatever it takes.

590
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,300
You can't give up

591
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,180
until you solve the case

592
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,100
and eliminate the gangs.

593
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,180
I will report to our leaders.

594
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,740
I know you won't let us down.

595
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,580
(Liu Yong)

596
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,060
Hello.

597
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,300
Mr. Xing, we found something
about the suspect's identity.

598
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,580
Got it.

599
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,900
Mr. Xing,

600
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,040
we verified the suspect's identity.

601
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,110
His name is Wu Ajin.
He's from Gang City.

602
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,860
The customs has no record
of him entering the country.

603
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,280
Gang City?

604
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,700
No wonder.

605
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,740
He's a stowaway.

606
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,720
Mr. Xing, Mr. Yang.

607
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
The suspect

608
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,700
must know Dian Lao'er.

609
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,980
(Binjiang, Incoming Call,
Duration, Local)

610
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,540
Are you an idiot?

611
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,580
We're going to make peace

612
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,820
instead of fighting.

613
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,380
Why are you bringing so many men?

614
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,300
Besides, it's a hospital.

615
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,970
Want to be arrested?

616
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,980
Idiot.

617
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,820
Bro.

618
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,460
What?

619
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,780
Considering his words,

620
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,860
I think we'll have a fight tomorrow.

621
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Are we going?

622
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,900
Of course.

623
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,820
If he's dead,

624
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,740
who will give us money?

625
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,300
Well, according to the conversation,

626
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,060
that man is also a big shot.

627
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,380
What if we get into

628
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,900
a fight?

629
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,700
Why are you so naive?

630
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
If he's killed,

631
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,580
there'll be a debt transfer.

632
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,860
We still need to collect the debt.

633
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,700
If there's no fight,

634
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,300
and he runs away,

635
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,420
we'll lose everything.

636
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,380
That's right.

637
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,220
Bro,

638
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,780
you're so smart.

639
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,100
No wonder you graduated
from high school.

640
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,460
Of course.

641
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,820
You didn't even finish primary school.

642
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,820
That's true.

643
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,100
Mr. Xing,

644
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,940
he deleted all the

645
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,780
call history.

646
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,300
Apart from the number we know,

647
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,420
there's another one.

648
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,650
We've investigated the user

649
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,700
Wei Jia.

650
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,340
He's very close to Dian Lao'er,

651
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,900
and he was summoned
by the police several times.

652
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
Which means

653
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,050
Wu Ajin is Dian Lao'er's

654
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,010
contact person.

655
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,160
Mr. Xing,

656
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,500
shall we summon

657
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,380
and interrogate him?

658
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,010
Wei Jia

659
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,490
is a firewall.

660
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,260
If we do it now,

661
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,120
he won't sell Dian Lao'er out.

662
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,660
(Wu Ajin, Attack, Bao Chenyan)

663
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,580
If Wu Ajin

664
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,460
is the attacker

665
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,980
who works for Dian Lao'er,

666
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,820
it'll mean the person who killed Wu Ajin

667
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,220
doesn't work for any forces

668
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,060
we know.

669
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,980
The biggest conflict of interest

670
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,500
between Dian Lao'er and Bao Chenyan

671
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,220
is the project of Tuan Island Market.

672
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,700
The person who killed Wu Ajin

673
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,340
also wants this project.

674
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,460
Mr. Xing,

675
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,380
what should we do now?

676
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,540
We'll have a full surveillance.

677
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,660
Once we get evidence,

678
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,140
we'll arrest him.

679
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,180
Roger.

680
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,060
Mr. Xing,

681
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,500
we need Mr. Tai's approval

682
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,620
of the full surveillance.

683
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,900
Okay.

684
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,100
Draft a report on behalf of

685
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,020
the task force.

686
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,900
Let him sign it.

687
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,900
Okay.

688
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,300
Dear leaders,

689
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,180
I've heard

690
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,340
Provincial Department

691
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,220
will send a steering group

692
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,620
to take over the case.

693
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,060
Is it true?

694
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,260
Well, if it's true,

695
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,300
our efforts will be in vain.

696
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
How can it be in vain?

697
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,820
You can give up now!

698
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,260
I'll keep an eye on Dian Lao'er!

699
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,780
He can't get away!

700
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,940
At that point,

701
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,380
I really passed out.

702
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,420
I was wearing a helmet.

703
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,180
Even if I didn't,

704
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,820
I couldn't see his face.

705
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,300
My eyes are not

706
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,860
cameras.

707
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,340
Then think about it carefully.

708
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Any details?

709
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,540
The motorcycle tires

710
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,500
are thick and big.

711
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,260
They seem

712
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,300
expensive.

713
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,420
And the engine

714
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,940
sounded like

715
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,620
10000 milliliters of displacement,

716
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,460
right?

717
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,180
Bro, don't talk nonsense.

718
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,020
10000 milliliters?

719
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,940
It can even launch you to the moon.

720
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,860
I was exaggerating.

721
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,060
At least 1000 milliliters.

722
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,340
Anything else?

723
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,100
Yes, there is.

724
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,660
Well,

725
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,660
I don't know if it was my illusion,

726
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,940
but I think that person

727
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,580
has a good shape.

728
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,140
You know what I mean.

729
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,740
The shape was good.

730
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,580
Maybe it's a woman.

731
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,940
Fine.

732
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,020
Keep thinking.

733
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,740
If you find out it's a woman,

734
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,060
don't forget my contribution.

735
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,180
Mr. Xing.

736
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,260
I'll make it clear.

737
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,220
No one told me anything

738
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,180
about the scene,

739
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,420
and I didn't go there for you.

740
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
It was an accident.

741
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,580
Come in.

742
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,780
Bao.

743
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,620
Are you okay?

744
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,580
How's Binbin?

745
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,980
He's fine.

746
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,380
Tianyi is looking after him.

747
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,230
Is there anything important
you want to tell me?

748
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,130
Don't move.

749
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,820
When you go to work

750
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,300
tomorrow, you have to

751
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,780
exit the project.

752
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,460
What do you mean?

753
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,420
Liang asked you to persuade me?

754
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Or is it Binbin's idea?

755
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,340
It has nothing to do with them.

756
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,780
If you're also worried about

757
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,580
my safety as they are.

758
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,500
You can rest assured.

759
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,700
Anyway, I've told Man

760
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,900
to sign the deal tomorrow,

761
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,380
and I'll pay for all the costs

762
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,980
and compensation.

763
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,780
Are you serious?

764
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,940
First, I won't quit.

765
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,820
Second, I don't want compensation.

766
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,980
Zixuan.

767
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,060
I'm begging you.

768
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,460
I'll kneel to you!

769
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,620
What are you doing?

770
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,140
We've known each other
for so many years.

771
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,100
It's been so long that I don't

772
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,020
even remember,

773
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
but I do remember

774
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,740
I've always listened to you.

775
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,180
However, can you please

776
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,100
listen to me this time?

777
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,220
If you really had

778
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,900
listened to me all these years,

779
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,540
you wouldn't have ended like this.

780
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,220
I know you're worried

781
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,580
about me as they are.

782
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,260
But I'm not a child anymore.

783
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,340
I'm not that girl
who needed you to take revenge

784
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,780
for me when I was bullied.

785
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,260
I've grown up.

786
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,860
My father often said

787
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,740
doing business is like
dancing on a cliff.

788
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,420
If I'd been scared of this,

789
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,340
the company wouldn't have come this far.

790
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,420
You're so annoying.

791
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,780
You always win!

792
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,340
But it's different this time!

793
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,260
Where's Na Fan?

794
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
Where is she?

795
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,460
I know what she's capable of.

796
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,300
She must stay with you

797
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,660
every minute!

798
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,500
Do you understand?

799
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,780
She's downstairs.

800
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,660
Don't worry.

801
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,020
I'm more scared of death.

802
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,620
I have a daughter.

803
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,500
Fine.

804
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,060
Okay, fine.

805
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,020
Rest well.

806
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,940
See you next time.

807
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,700
