00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,480
Jiang,

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,440
(Sixteen years ago)
you've worked hard these years.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,720
As your uncle, I should take care of you.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,680
But finally, you took care of me.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,960
I don't like hearing that.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,600
You are being distant with me.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,640
The family did not speak two words.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,680
Isn't it?

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,450
Moreover,

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,840
thanks to your suggestions these years,

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,640
otherwise, with my brain...

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,000
Look at everything I have now.

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,520
Half of this big office

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,220
is mine,

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,220
and half is yours.

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,860
I should thank you.

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,180
Let's get to the point.

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,660
Do you want to make your company bigger

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,660
and make more money?

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,700
How could I not want to, right?

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,100
Why should I settle for this?

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,620
You know,

23
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,760
right?

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,020
Some matters of the company

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,500
cannot be put on the table.

26
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,260
This is exactly what I want to tell you.

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,100
To make the company go further,

28
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,580
these shady businesses of yours

29
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,140
need to be cleaned up.

30
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,940
Cleaned up?

31
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,180
I don't understand.

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,900
Any economic form

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,100
is imperfect

34
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,580
and the gray economy

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,580
is even more so.

36
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,100
The company has come this far.

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,620
It's time

38
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,660
to consider shifting these gray tones

39
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,180
towards positive colors.

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,060
Of course, you still have an advantage.

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,580
You are skilled

42
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,020
at walking the edge of laws and rules

43
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,100
to maximize development.

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,340
I still can't understand.

45
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,820
But it doesn't matter.

46
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,380
You can understand. That's enough.

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,220
I'll do whatever you say.

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,060
All right?

49
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,260
It's not that complicated.

50
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
From the perspective

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,260
of geography and economy in Binjiang,

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,980
you must break through the limitations

53
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,660
of industry and region

54
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,100
to develop and grow.

55
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,660
However,

56
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,940
the means

57
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,340
must not directly conflict

58
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,420
with the law.

59
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,820
I think I kind of understand now.

60
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,220
- Got it?
- Go on.

61
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,020
I have come up with an operational model.

62
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,940
I'll tell you once it matures.

63
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,860
There is only one ultimate goal,

64
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,580
to be a multinational corporation.

65
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,620
Multi what?

66
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,540
Multinational.

67
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,420
Oh my, multinational.

68
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,820
What's wrong? Don't you believe it?

69
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,300
No, no, no.

70
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,820
It's not that I don't disbelieve.

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,780
Uncle, you are indeed a cultured person.

72
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,500
You, you, you are bolder than I am.

73
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,620
So,

74
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,780
I want to go to South Korea and Japan.

75
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,460
In these two countries,

76
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,780
the gray economy has already taken shape.

77
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,910
I will evaluate the operation model.

78
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,300
After I return,

79
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,250
we will discuss how to implement it.

80
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,860
Ok.

81
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,860
Multinational.

82
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,020
While you are busy with it,

83
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,140
I will first take

84
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,900
over the Tuan Island Market.

85
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,660
Anyway, those guys are a bunch of lowlifes.

86
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,220
They won't listen unless they suffer it.

87
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,900
After they have been fully merged,

88
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,740
right,

89
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,580
perhaps they will know

90
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,460
who the boss of Binjiang is.

91
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,300
Wait a moment.

92
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Merger

93
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,820
is an important form of development.

94
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,300
But we need to be cautious

95
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,660
about how to merge.

96
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,220
Simply fighting doesn't work.

97
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,180
I'll listen to you.

98
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,660
We don't fight.

99
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,500
We don't.

100
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,620
Hurry up and tell me when to leave.

101
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,660
When do you set off?

102
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,220
I've thought about it for a long time.

103
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,460
I'm leaving tomorrow.

104
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,900
How is it?

105
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,980
Are you satisfied now?

106
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,020
Take it.

107
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,380
I have enough money.

108
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,820
Take it.

109
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,180
In case something happens,

110
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,700
you can still hold on with it.

111
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,420
Wait for my return.

112
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,540
=Black&White Forest=

113
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,540
=Episode 27=

114
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,820
I want a divorce.

115
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,180
Because of the matter of Lin Yisheng?

116
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,740
Xing Liang clearly knew everything

117
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,860
but just watched me jump into the pit,

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,940
without saying a word.

119
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,500
I can understand that it's his job.

120
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,220
Compared to Binbin,

121
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,300
work is more important.

122
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,380
Compared to family,

123
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,860
work is more important.

124
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,340
Compared to me,

125
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,770
work is still more important.

126
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,740
But now it's the hard-earned money

127
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,900
of so many merchants.

128
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,500
But look,

129
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,700
he still didn't change it.

130
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,580
So I...

131
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,660
I can't understand him right now.

132
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,740
I think his job, his ideal

133
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,820
should be

134
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,540
to protect his own little family first

135
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,900
before protecting everyone else.

136
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,740
But I...

137
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,540
I...

138
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,140
I can't...

139
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,460
I can't go on living like this.

140
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,100
I feel like I'm tired.

141
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Come on.

142
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,420
You are really annoying.

143
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,860
But I think you

144
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,740
are right about Xing Liang.

145
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Think about it.

146
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,420
On the matter of Lin Yisheng,

147
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,300
Xing Liang

148
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
deceived you.

149
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,820
What is behind this deception?

150
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,100
A rift has developed

151
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,980
between you, with no trust left.

152
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,620
So what is the next step?

153
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,500
That may lead to betrayal.

154
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,860
I think after betrayal occurs,

155
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,620
he may be likely to cheat.

156
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,060
Nonsense!

157
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,900
He can't...

158
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,820
Why did you...

159
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,100
What nonsense are you talking about?

160
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,020
Look at you.

161
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,380
Look at you.

162
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,700
I know you're trying to make me happy

163
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,060
and you're kidding me, but...

164
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,580
You're always been like this.

165
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,380
When it comes to the key issue,

166
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,300
you still protect him and care for him.

167
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,580
Xing Liang is the same.

168
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,900
He is a police officer.

169
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
He has no choice.

170
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,860
It's not that I don't understand.

171
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,020
I am just...

172
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,740
I have some emotions about this.

173
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
I don't know who to talk to.

174
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,540
Xing Liang

175
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,900
has kept quite a few things

176
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,260
to himself.

177
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
He is worried

178
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,380
that you and I are getting together,

179
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,780
and is afraid that you might get involved

180
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
in the case of the Tuan Island.

181
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,500
Do you know?

182
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,980
You two are actually the same.

183
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm always the one who gets hurt.

184
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,980
Why do I feel you know him better than I do?

185
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,910
I don't know anything about him.

186
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,300
I can't stand him the most.

187
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,460
I have no choice.

188
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,900
I don't want to see you like this.

189
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,460
But now Tu Manjiang has run away.

190
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,540
If Lin Yisheng doesn't admit it,

191
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,980
what do you think I should do?

192
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,860
You have me.

193
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,650
Don't worry.

194
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,980
I have a way.

195
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,980
You can't cause trouble anymore.

196
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,180
You know,

197
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,460
I really want

198
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,740
to be a decent person.

199
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,900
Don't worry.

200
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,980
A decent person

201
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,140
must not do anything bad.

202
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,980
Don't cry anymore.

203
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,820
Come on, come on.

204
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,180
Go back.

205
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,980
Go back, go back, go back.

206
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,460
I have your word.

207
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,180
Don't worry.

208
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,100
Everything will be fine.

209
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
Xing Liang,

210
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,380
you really have good luck.

211
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,260

213
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,020
(Wangwang Seafood)

214
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,460
Hey.

215
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,900
I guessed you'd be here.

216
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
You know I'm coming?

217
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,620
Excuse me.

218
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,740
Take a set of tableware.

219
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,860
Who else is coming?

220
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,500
Why not eat at home?

221
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,580
Why come outside?

222
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,860
Have you already eaten at home?

223
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,900
Here are your tableware.

224
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
Thank you.

225
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,860
You don't even want to eat at home,

226
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,060
but you make me eat at home.

227
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,540
Let me tell you,

228
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,420
I noticed that your sis and Xing Liang

229
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,040
had already entered a state of war.

230
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,780
It was very unsafe.

231
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,660
See if the food is enough.

232
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,140
Add whatever you want to eat.

233
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,060
So many dishes.

234
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,580
That's enough.

235
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,900
This dish, Tianyi and I...

236
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,580
What were you and my sister

237
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,820
talking about at the door?

238
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,300
It has nothing to do with you.

239
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,980
So it's about money.

240
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,370
What are you planning to get money?

241
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,420
Here's my advice.

242
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,300
There are two solutions

243
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,660
to this matter.

244
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,340
One is to catch Tu Manjiang

245
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,860
and force him to give the money back.

246
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,620
The other is to have the police

247
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,420
file a case in the name of financial crimes.

248
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,860
But for the benefits of the merchants,

249
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,460
two things need to be done simultaneously.

250
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,740
Don't just focus on eating.

251
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,940
Say something.

252
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,940
Say what?

253
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,620
Say what?

254
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,700
You think it's just kids fighting,

255
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,380
if you can't win, tell the teacher.

256
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,260
I really can't deal with someone

257
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,140
as stubborn as you.

258
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,020
What era is it now, Bao?

259
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,940
I was originally thinking

260
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,020
if nothing happened

261
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,900
to Tianyi,

262
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,340
I would entrust

263
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,260
my brothers

264
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,300
and this territory

265
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,420
to him.

266
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,780
I'm still thinking...

267
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,980
I have great plans in mind.

268
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,460
I want you and Tianyi

269
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,340
to be buddies

270
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,620
for a lifetime.

271
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,980
Tianyi is already dead now.

(Tao)

273
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,780
(Tao)

274
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,620
Binbin,

275
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,500
did you bring any money?

276
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,140
Did you come out to eat without money?

277
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,740
You know it.

278
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,260
I usually

279
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,540
don't go out alone.

280
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,900
A large group of people are around me.

281
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,220
After all these years of eating together,

282
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,780
when have you ever seen me pay?

283
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,780
I'm being honest with you.

284
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,420
Being a big brother

285
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,660
is really pitiful.

286
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,860
No freedom.

287
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,420
Did you bring any money or not?

288
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,140
You've got me.

289
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,780
Just go.

290
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,180
Are you really angry?

291
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,700
What's wrong with you?

292
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,020
When you were little, I could touch you.

293
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,700
But now I can't even get close to you.

294
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,580
Your hands are oily.

295
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,780
Why touch my head?

296
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,740
You know

297
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,900
you are my heart,

298
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,220
- you are my liver.
- Get lost.

299
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,700
You are my heart.

300
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,780
You're my liver.

301
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,020
You are three-quarters of my life.

302
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,780
I found out about Lin Yisheng.

303
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,260
He used to have a mistress

304
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,540
who is a good friend of Fangfang.

305
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,020
Fangfang said

306
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,580
Lin Yisheng is getting ready to leave.

307
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,900
Where is he planning to go?

308
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,020
He said he wanted to go back.

309
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,620
Do you know when Fangfang

310
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,820
met her?

311
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,660
It's in the evening.

312
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,940
In the evening, huh?

313
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,260
Let's do this.

314
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,020
You asked Fangfang

315
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,740
to find a way

316
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,140
to get Lin Yisheng's current location.

317
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,700
Call me once you have the results.

318
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,220
Ok, leave it to me.

319
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,780
Ok, thank you.

320
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,740
Do you have a conscience

321
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,820
and want to settle the bill?

322
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,660
Ok, I'll be there right away.

323
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,700
Fangfang,

324
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,660
don't be afraid.

325
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,300
Make a call to your friend

326
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,900
and ask her where she is.

327
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,820
Hello? Lexin.

328
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,460
Lexin, where are you?

329
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,060
I have arrived at my place.

330
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,900
What's wrong?

331
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,420
You...

332
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,580
Fangfang, what's the matter?

333
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,420
Speak.

334
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,140
You are that friend of Fangfang, right?

335
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,220
What kind of potion did you give her?

336
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,500
After she met you today,

337
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,420
she insisted on going to Huqing.

338
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,660
(Lexin)
Listen up.

339
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,700
If she wants to leave,

340
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,260
that's impossible.

341
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,980
We are now in a society governed by law.

342
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,180
What you are doing is illegal.

343
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,050
I make the rules here.

344
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,980
Everyone has to follow the rules here.

345
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,420
Do you know who my man is?

346
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,660
If you dare to offend me,

347
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,820
you'll regret it.

348
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,420
I don't care who you are.

349
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,180
If you want to take her away, fine,

350
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
prepare 100,000 yuan to compensate me.

351
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,820
After I get the money,

352
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,100
I'll let you take Fangfang away.

353
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,780
Give me an account.

354
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,900
I'll transfer the money over.

355
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,500
I only want cash.

356
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,380
Cash on delivery.

357
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,300
Where are you?

358
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,660
I will take Fangfang over.

359
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,140
Lexin...

360
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,060
Lexin, save me, Lexin...

361
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
Fangfang, don't be afraid.

362
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,460
I am at Room 402, Xinsheng Hotel.

363
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,180
You'd better not try any tricks.

364
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,700
Lexin...

365
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Lexin, save me.

366
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,620
- Bao.
- Speak.

367
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,820
I have found out.

368
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,420
She's at Room 402, Xinsheng Hotel.

369
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
I'll go there right now.

370
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,740
Get it.

371
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,860
Lin Yisheng,

372
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,060
you finally appear.

373
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,500
Xinsheng Hotel.

374
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,420
Let's go.

375
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,060
I know the owner of this hotel.

376
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,060
I just asked him about it.

377
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,700
There is only one person in the room.

378
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,580
Usually, Lin Yisheng

379
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,060
comes back late at night,

380
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,400
and he doesn't bring his subordinates.

381
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,110
Let's go up and have a look.

382
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,020
Who's there?

383
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,100
Lexin,

384
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,940
it's me.

385
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,620
I'm a police officer.

386
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,580
Please cooperate with me.

387
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,820
What

388
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,340
did he do wrong?

389
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,520
This matter involves confidentiality

390
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,820
and cannot be disclosed to you for now.

391
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,580
What time does he usually come back?

392
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,580
He called me

393
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,580
and said he would be back later.

394
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
It's just

395
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,860
around this time.

396
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,460
Fangfang,

397
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,620
is everything ok?

398
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,100
I'm fine.

399
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,380
Open the door.

400
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,380
I'm back.

401
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,860
Open the door.

402
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,740
Open the door.

403
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,460
Open the door.

404
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,500
- You're back.
- You took so long.

405
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,580
You took so long to open the door.

406
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,780
Let me tell you...

407
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,340
Pour some tea.

408
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,620
Pour me some tea.

409
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,980
Wake up.

410
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,340
Pour some tea.

411
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,940
Bao.

412
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,700
Sit.

413
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,140
Have a seat, Bao.

414
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,780
Bao.

415
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,580
Bao, Bao, Bao.

416
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,340
This is a society ruled by law, Bao.

417
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,500
Don't be impulsive.

418
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,580
You...

419
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,460
Bao, Bao...

420
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,140
From Bao's attitude, I think

421
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,820
he may take action against Lin Yisheng.

422
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,580
I was wondering if you could

423
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,180
file a case to investigate Lin Yisheng

424
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,580
under the name of a financial case.

425
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,180
At least put some pressure on him.

426
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,980
ECD is in charge of the financial cases.

427
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,380
Out unit can't interfere.

428
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,220
You wait a moment.

429
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,180
Let me make a contact.

430
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,300
Be sure to be safe.

431
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,460
Keep a close eye on Bao Chenyan

432
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,780
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

433
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,140
Contact me anytime if there's anything.

434
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,460
Got it.

435
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,460
Mr. Li,

436
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,580
it's me.

437
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,140
Sorry to bother you so late.

438
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,860
There is one thing like this.

439
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,540
Mr. Qi,

440
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,940
Bao has taken Lin Yisheng away.

441
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,740
This is a great opportunity.

442
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,100
You can cast the net now.

443
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,060
If everything goes smoothly,

444
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,460
the Tuan Island project

445
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,740
will be yours

446
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,220
tomorrow.

447
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,580
What do you want me to do?

448
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,660
You just need to send someone to force

449
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,540
the merchants to hand over their shops,

450
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,380
and then

451
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,580
let someone shift the blame

452
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,540
onto Bao Chenyan.

453
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,780
That's all.

454
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,900
When?

455
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,420
At that time,

456
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
I will call you.

457
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,940
Hello? Man.

458
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,820
What's the matter?

459
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,860
I found the person who sold out Changhe.

460
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,860
But they are very strong.

461
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,580
They are chasing me everywhere.

462
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,540
Send more strong people over here.

463
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,300
I pay 150,000 yuan per person.

464
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,580
After the matter is done,

465
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,620
I'll pay another 100,000 yuan.

466
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,900
I said they are two different matters.

467
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,540
I will go there in person.

468
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,380
Let's talk about it after it is done.

469
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,660
Ok.

470
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,900
Lao'er,

471
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,660
arrange ten strong people for me.

472
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,500
Bring the stuff

473
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
and go out with me

474
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,860
tomorrow morning.

475
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,020
Ok.

476
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,820
Go ahead.

477
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
Mr. Lin,

478
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,860
you might not understand me.

479
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,420
When I was young, my family was very poor.

480
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,620
It's different from your situation.

481
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,380
I had no toys back then.

482
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,820
The I placed a long nail

483
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,420
on the railway tracks.

484
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,140
Once the train passed,

485
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,540
it became a dart.

486
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,260
I have practiced for a long time.

487
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,380
- My skill is pretty good.
- No.

488
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,220
Don't...

489
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,220
I don't want darts.

490
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,500
Bao, don't joke around.

491
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
No, no.

492
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,180
Sorry to trouble you today

493
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,660
- and recall childhood with me.
- Bao.

494
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,470
Bao, I tell you the truth.

495
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,620
I...

496
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,260
I made an appointment with Tu Manjiang.

497
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,700
After things are settled,

498
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,100
we...

499
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,820
We will meet in Aocheng.

500
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,420
Where is the money?

501
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,780
Money...

502
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,020
...has been diverted to different accounts.

503
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,500
Once the money laundering is done,

504
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,100
it will be...

505
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,940
...consolidated into the overseas account.

506
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,580
I've already told you everything, Bao.

507
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,500
Bao, I've already told you.

508
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,340
What is the password for this phone?

509
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
I can't remember.

510
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,020
I remember.

511
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,300
616414.

512
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,140
Which phone number is your dad's?

513
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,940
The first one.

514
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,380
Dad,

515
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,380
help me, I am Lin.

516
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,700
Dad, help me.

517
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,660
Speak louder!

518
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,260
Save me, Dad.

519
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,500
Save me!

520
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,740
Save me...

521
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,580
Hello?

522
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,140
Mr. Lin.

523
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,460
Yeah, what you just heard

524
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,860
is your son's voice.

525
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,340
Your son is now in my hands.

526
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,900
You return the money

527
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,460
to its original account.

528
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,180
I assure you

529
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,780
that your son will live a long life.

530
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,700
It takes time to raise

531
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,980
such a large sum of money.

532
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,580
Give me five days.

533
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,500
Just three days.

534
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,420
If you delay for one hour,

535
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,900
your son will lose a part.

536
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,180
I assure you.

537
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,700
Is it him?

538
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,300
It's him.

539
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,460
Deal with him.

540
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,700
Bao!

541
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,180
Hurry up, hurry up.

542
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,940
Go.

543
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,940
Doctor!

544
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,020
Doctor!

545
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,900
Make way.

546
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,020
Doctor!

547
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,540
Er'leng.

548
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,460
Er'leng.

549
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,500
Please wait outside.

550
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,180
(In rescue)

551
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,100
(In rescue)

552
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,980
What happened?

553
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,060
It must be someone hired by the Lin family.

554
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
Who is the patient's family member?

555
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,170
I am his elder brother.

556
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,320
How's it going?

557
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,820
He has a comminuted fracture of the knee,

558
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,260
with nerves and blood vessels severed.

559
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,100
Surgery is the only option. Sign here.

560
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,620
Doctor, I...

561
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,380
I didn't hear clearly.

562
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,300
What kind of surgery?

563
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,860
Amputation can only be done through surgery.

564
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,060
There's no way.

565
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,820
The nerves and blood vessels are severed.

566
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,980
He is so good.

567
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,300
Why does he need to amputate?

568
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,140
Bao.

569
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,460
Can't we connect the blood vessels and nerves?

570
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,460
Is amputation really necessary?

571
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,980
Theoretically, they can be connected.

572
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,220
But his injuries are too severe.

573
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,820
The nerves cannot be connected.

574
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,020
If amputation is not done, he'll be in danger.

575
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,180
Sign it.

576
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,300
Bao.

577
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,260
Saving him is the priority.

578
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,540
Binbin.

579
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,140
Call the police.

580
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,420
It doesn't matter.

581
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,900
It doesn't matter, anything is fine.

582
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,820
Call the police.

583
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,940
My people can't be hurt by them anymore.

584
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,060
Call the police. I need help.

585
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,910
Hurry up.

586
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,030
I'm on it.

587
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,380
(Public Security)

588
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,060
Stop right there.

589
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,820
Everyone, don't move.

590
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,580
Bao,

591
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,660
my situation...

592
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,060
Hello? Who is this?

593
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,620
Bao,

594
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,460
it's me.

595
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,660
How is Er'leng doing now?

596
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,140
Your own rules of the martial world

597
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,900
can't save him now, right?

598
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,070
Do you still have the face to say it?

599
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,580
The word 'rules'

600
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,700
coming out of your mouth

601
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,900
is just a joke.

602
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
Let me tell you,

603
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,060
you better hide yourself well

604
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,300
and don't let me find you.

605
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,340
Otherwise, I fear you won't be able

606
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,100
to pay back this debt of Er'leng.

607
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,420
You haven't repaid the blood debt you owe me.

608
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,020
I'll telling you,

609
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,220
the life of Er'leng

610
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,580
is not sufficient.

611
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,540
What I want is all of your lives.

612
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,540
Blood debt?

613
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,180
What do you mean?

614
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,740
Do you still remember Wild Jiang?

615
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,100
Wild Jiang?

616
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,020
You make it clear.

617
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
Who exactly are you?

618
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Let me tell you,

619
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Wild Jiang

620
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,180
is my nephew.

621
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,980
You caused my family to be shattered.

622
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,780
I will not let you go.

623
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,980
Wild Jiang committed murder and robbery,

624
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,940
and was caught by the police

625
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,180
and sentenced to death.

626
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,740
He deserved this.

627
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,740
Aren't you clear in your heart?

628
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,580
He was guilty.

629
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,420
What about my sis and her husband?

630
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
Were they guilty?

631
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,020
Weren't they innocent?

632
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,540
I have endured hardships for twelve years.

633
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,940
Finally, I come to this day.

634
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,860
I will let you know

635
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,660
who owes debts to whom

636
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,540
and who should pay with blood.

637
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,580
Hello?

638
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,260
Hello?

639
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,700
Xing.

640
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,620
They all confessed.

641
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
These people come from Da An Alliance.

642
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,060
The leader is Sun Changhai's uncle.

643
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,940
His name is Zheng Haotian.

644
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,700
According to their statement,

645
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,380
they were summoned suddenly

646
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,140
by someone named Zhan Xiaoman.

647
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,860
Zhan Xiaoman?

648
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,700
Yes.

649
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,040
He shares the same name as Wild Jiang's uncle.

650
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,740
Do you think this is a coincidence or...

651
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,540
Mr. Xing,

652
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,670
this is the information

653
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,260
you asked me to investigate.

654
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,060
Tu Manjiang was known
as Zhuang Wentai by then.

655
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,300
According to his teachers and classmates,

656
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,820
Zhuang Wentai was very introverted.

657
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,980
He often went out alone.

658
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,740
He was only close

659
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,760
to someone named Zhan Xiaoman.

660
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
This is Zhan Xiaoman's information.

661
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,820
But this is quite strange.

662
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,340
Zhan Xiaoman disappeared later

663
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,460
and has been missing to this day.

664
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,660
(Household Registration Table)

665
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,620
The real name of Wild Jiang is Zeng Zhijiang.

666
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,820
Yes.

667
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,940
Do you still remember

668
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,900
his mother's name is Zhan Xiao...

669
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,060
- Zhan Xiaotu.
- Zhan Xiaotu.

670
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,700
(Zhang Xiaotu)

671
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,940
(Zhan Xiaotu Zhan Xiaoman Zeng Zhijiang)

672
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,820
Tu Manjiang.

673
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,340
One character from each name.

674
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,380
Tu Manjiang

675
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,460
is actually Zhan Xiaoman.

676
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,740
Man...

677
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,420
...is the uncle of Wild Jiang.

678
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,660
He has done all these things

679
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,020
to take revenge on me.

680
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,430
I don't really understand.

681
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,560
Back then,

682
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,100
Wild Jiang kidnapped Binbin as a hostage

683
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,140
and demanded 10% of the shares

684
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,860
of the Tuan Island Market

685
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,530
from Mr. Wen,

686
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,180
along with the management rights.

687
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,510
I couldn't swallow my anger at that time.

688
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,220
I brought a few guys to Binjiang.

689
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,980
Later,

690
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,660
Wild Jiang's people

691
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,820
were arrested.

692
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,780
Wild Jiang was executed.

693
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,900
I thought this matter had been over.

694
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,700
I really didn't expect

695
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,060
there's still Man left.

696
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,340
It's really weird.

697
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,340
As the saying goes,

698
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,100
nephews resemble their uncles.

699
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,380
I truly didn't tell it.

700
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,260
When will you pay back the money

701
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,180
you owe us?

702
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,180
All our money has been invested

703
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,120
into the Make Money project.

704
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,860
We will pay you back

705
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,100
after we can withdraw it.

706
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,740
That means you have no money.

707
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,180
You signed it, right?

708
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,380
If you don't have money,

709
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,100
take the shop as collateral.

710
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,940
What are you doing?

711
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,500
What are you doing?

712
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,140
Go out.

713
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Our money has been scammed.

714
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,580
Now you are coming to collect our shops.

715
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,740
Are you still going to let us live?

716
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,580
Exactly.

717
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,960
Everyone,

718
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,900
it is like this.

719
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,540
On our mortgage contract,

720
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,940
it is clearly stated

721
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,860
in black and white.

722
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,140
If you can't pay this money back,

723
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,460
we can only take your shop as collateral.

724
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,540
You are always trying to scam our money.

725
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,980
Now you want to take over our shops.

726
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,940
Guys, we can't keep enduring this.

727
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,220
Let's drive them out together.

728
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,780
Get out, get out.

729
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,700
Get out.

730
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,190
- Out, out!
- Get out!

731
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,780
Get out!

732
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,660
Sir...

733
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,260
Tu Manjiang

734
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
is actually Zhan Xiaoman.

735
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,740
He called me today,

736
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,060
saying he wants to kill all of us

737
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,800
and repay blood debts with blood.

738
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,420
Zhan Xiaoman

739
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,900
is the younger brother of Zhan Xiaotu,

740
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,340
Wild Jiang's mother.

741
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,100
Although

742
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,900
they are uncle and nephew,

743
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,220
actually,

744
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,580
they are just three years apart.

745
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,660
Twelve years ago,

746
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,500
Zhan Xiaoman went abroad

747
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,700
and lost all contact later.

748
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,140
Now we know

749
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,220
that he had plastic surgery

750
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,420
while in South Korea,

751
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,140
transforming into his classmate

752
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,540
Zhang Wentai's appearance

753
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,540
and naturally assumed his identity.

754
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,800
After returning to the country,

755
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,900
he changed name to Tu Manjiang

756
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,630
and continued with the next phase.

757
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,100
So he started planning

758
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,060
twelve years ago, didn't he?

759
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,420
He is hiding too deep.

760
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,700
This game has been set up for twelve years.

761
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,260
What's going on? I'm busy now.

762
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,540
Just say it.

763
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,420
Hello? Bao.

764
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,890
Something happened at the market.

765
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,420
Hurry over here.

766
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,720
I'll go handle it.

767
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,550
Liu Yong, a fight occurred at the market.

768
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,020
Take people there.

769
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,150
Bao.

770
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,340
Who did this?

771
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
The leader is surnamed An.

772
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,900
He came over a few days ago.

773
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,220
Qi Hanchen.

774
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,940
What do you mean?

775
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,460
From a logical standpoint,

776
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,810
this is a case of life for a life.

777
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,360
Debt should be repaid.

778
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,380
From a legal perspective,

779
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,770
I was just using means

780
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,060
to protect my legal rights.

781
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,460
I will definitely pay you back the money.

782
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,820
But...

783
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,900
But your people hurt my people.

784
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,460
How should we deal with it?

785
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,300
Return the money first before we talk.

786
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,100
If you don't pay back the money,

787
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,980
even if you don't come to me,

788
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,300
I will have to look for you.

789
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,020
Bao, please let me go.

790
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,820
Sheng.

791
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,100
Sheng!

792
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,180
Mr. Lin,

793
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,180
look.

794
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,860
Your son is still alive.

795
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,180
Pay back the money

796
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,980
you scammed from me,

797
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,100
and also the medical expenses

798
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,660
for my injured brothers.

799
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,740
Bao, please let me go.

800
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,660
Five minutes.

801
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,900
Otherwise,

802
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,820
wait to collect your son's body.

803
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,380
Wait a moment.

804
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,660
I will transfer the money right now.

805
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,520
The money has been transferred.

806
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,700
I promise

807
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,140
I will never deceive you again.

808
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,220
Hope you can show mercy

809
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,540
to let him go.

810
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,580
