1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,060
(Five years ago)

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,020
(Zeng)

3
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,100
(Zhan Xiaotu, Zeng Guolong)

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,560
Uncle Jiang.

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,760
Who are they?

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,880
They are all my family.

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,880
I came earlier

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,560
to accompany you
in honoring your father.

9
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,160
Today, I brought you here

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,200
to honor my family.

11
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,180
(Late Father Na Song's Tomb)

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,840
How did they die?

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
Like your father,

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,200
they were killed by others.

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,840
Why did you only bring me here today?

16
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,640
You're like my child.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,280
I didn't tell you before

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
because I was afraid it'd make you sad.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,460
I was afraid it would hurt you.

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
It's not sad.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
It's being unable to face it.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,640
This emotion

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,000
is with me every day.

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
Yes.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,480
You're right.

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,480
Now,

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,440
I am the only living relative they have.

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,440
You too.

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,360
Uncle Jiang,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,600
I know you'll avenge me.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm willing to help you,

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,680
but right now,

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,440
I can't do anything.

34
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,320
I don't even know
who to go to for revenge.

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,240
What if there's an opportunity now?

36
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,460
=Black&White Forest=

37
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,460
=Episode 25=

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,720
Are you crazy, sis?

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,490
Give me your phone first,
and I'll explain.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,160
Are you crazy, sis?

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,440
Now, tell me why.

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,480
- Let go!
- Tell me!

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,600
Tianyi!

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Tianyi!

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
Why did you kill him?

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
If I hadn't killed him,

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
what would happen to you?

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,280
You shouldn't have killed him.

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,800
What should I do?

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,640
What shouldn't I do?

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
If he hadn't died,

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
you would.

53
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,440
Should you die?

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,600
What about my relatives

55
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,840
and your father?

56
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,320
Should they all die?

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
I overheard your conversation.

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
It's a pity

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
you couldn't convince him.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm sorry

61
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,800
for Tianyi's death,

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,960
but if he didn't die,

63
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,440
our plan couldn't be completed.

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,380
What nonsense plan?

65
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,880
I don't care!

66
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,480
I don't care!

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,640
What do you still care about now?

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
You only

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
care about Wen Binbin, right?

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,240
If I had known you'd turn out like this,

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,240
I shouldn't have promised

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,600
to ensure his safety.

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Let me tell you.

74
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
If you don't do it,

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
someone else will.

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
If you do it,

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Wen Binbin will live.

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
If you don't,

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,040
Wen Binbin will die.

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,480
If I kill you and turn myself in,

81
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,200
he's still safe.

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,120
You know me.

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,400
Before we take revenge,

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
we don't have the right to die.

85
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
I'll kill you sooner or later.

86
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,740
Fine.

87
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,510
Before you kill me,

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,470
I will bring your father's killer

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,670
right in front of you

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,880
to fulfill your final wish.

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
I really went through a lot

92
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,400
to find Tu Manjiang for you.

93
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm telling you.

94
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,740
How about this?

95
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,660
Next time you come back to the country,

96
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,720
I'll treat you to authentic kimchi.

97
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,740
Is that okay?

98
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,100
Is what you said true?

99
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,420
Keep talking,
and you'll lose your kimchi.

100
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,560
Let's get back to business.

101
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,260
I first went to Tu Manjiang's

102
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,500
university in South Korea.

103
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,620
I found out that he did

104
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,740
take over half a year off.

105
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,460
The reason was
that he had a car accident

106
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,380
and needed to recover.

107
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,050
But I didn't know

108
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,260
which hospital he stayed in.

109
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,670
To get the bottom of it for you,

110
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,500
I visited hospitals one by one.

111
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,500
After so many years,

112
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,940
many patient records have been lost.

113
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,460
I thought it was hopeless,

114
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,860
but at that moment,

115
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,940
things took a turn.

116
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,660
I heard

117
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,980
about Ms. Jin.

118
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,100
Ms. Jin

119
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,320
was the one

120
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,500
who took care of Tu Manjiang

121
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,660
for over half a year at the hospital.

122
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,580
According to her,

123
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,780
Tu Manjiang

124
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,700
was in the hospital

125
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,460
recovering from a car accident,

126
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,980
and she took care of him.

127
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,020
About the lady you just mentioned,

128
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,660
did she notice

129
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,700
anything unusual

130
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,780
while taking care of him?

131
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,900
Anything she could remember?

132
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,150
I asked. Ms. Jin said

133
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,540
Tu Manjiang was very boring.

134
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,760
He just read books every day
to pass the time.

135
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,290
There was nothing special.

136
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,540
You said his personality changed

137
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,240
after returning to the country.

138
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,300
Maybe it was
because of that car accident.

139
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,460
Surviving a close call

140
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,540
often leads

141
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,300
to a huge change in personality.

142
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,580
Alright, Wu.

143
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,220
Help me with one more thing.

144
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,990
Find out if he had

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,900
any close friends

146
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,210
or classmates during his time

147
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,100
at school, okay?

148
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,540
You really are persistent.

149
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,980
I later heard from Ms. Jin

150
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,480
that during that half a year,

151
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,740
no one ever came to visit him.

152
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,380
I've already told you.

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,300
We're only business partners,

154
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,140
not friends.

155
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,700
You killed him in the backyard
of the Guanhai Tea House.

156
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,860
You've made it hard for us.

157
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,580
Cleaning up after you

158
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,010
wasn't part of our plan.

159
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,020
I know this puts you in a tough spot,

160
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,080
but it really happened suddenly.

161
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,440
I've already cleaned up.

162
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,040
The police
won't come after you directly.

163
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,060
That's good.

164
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,660
Will this current situation

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,100
affect your subsequent plans?

166
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,860
It will.

167
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,540
Xing Liang and Bao
will eventually come for me,

168
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,340
but I'll use this incident

169
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,660
to divert their attention.

170
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,380
You need to speed up your plans.

171
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,620
The reason I'm calling today

172
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,540
is to discuss the next steps with you.

173
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,140
Please cooperate.

174
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,500
Let me repeat.

175
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,140
No matter what you do next,

176
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,020
I just need to ensure
my company's interests

177
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,380
aren't harmed in the coming plan.

178
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,740
With that premise,

179
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,040
I'll have Mr. An communicate with you.

180
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,700
As for how to cooperate,

181
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,540
just tell him.

182
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,580
Go to Binjiang asap.

183
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,620
Check all the contracts

184
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,500
and payments

185
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,740
related to them.

186
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,260
If you find any issues,

187
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,680
clear them immediately.

188
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,780
Also,

189
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,740
get the financial company out asap.

190
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,020
We only need

191
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,680
the share pledge
from the Tuan Island merchants.

192
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,100
What about the crime scene?

193
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,460
Let them secure it first.

194
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,340
Call the police in an hour.

195
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,460
Let the police investigate.

196
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,690
Our people

197
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,950
must not go in.

198
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,220
OK.

199
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,540
I'll arrange it right away.

200
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,020
(Building 2, Tower)

201
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,540
Hello, Fan.

202
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,500
These are the main points.

203
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,700
Have you all remembered?

204
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,500
Think it over when you get back.

205
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,540
You'll definitely...

206
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,300
(Binbin)

207
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,300
Hello?

208
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,420
What's up?

209
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,380
Alright.

210
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,600
He's with me. We're having a meeting.

211
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,660
You can come here.

212
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,420
All of you can leave now.

213
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Bao, I'll leave first.

214
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,740
Man.

215
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,190
Come here.

216
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,140
What's going on?

217
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,620
- What are you doing?
- Man.

218
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,580
What's your relationship with Na Fan?

219
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,340
Tell me the truth. Don't lie.

220
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
What relationship?

221
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,740
Tell me.

222
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,700
What's going on?

223
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,860
Many years ago,

224
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,420
I sponsored a child from an orphanage.

225
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,340
Since she was twelve,

226
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,340
I've been anonymously supporting her.

227
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,740
Later, she grew up.

228
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,460
She somehow

229
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,660
found out my identity

230
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,740
and came to find me.

231
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,460
That child is Na Fan.

232
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,620
How did you find me?

233
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,940
Please don't get me wrong.

234
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,980
Well,

235
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,420
the orphanage

236
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,260
kept everything confidential.

237
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,310
They never revealed anything
about you.

238
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,020
It was me...

239
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,690
I secretly gathered some clues

240
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,890
from Director Yang.

241
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,260
Then I kept looking for you.

242
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,090
It must've taken a long time.

243
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,460
Actually, from the day you sponsored me,

244
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,140
I've wanted to find you,

245
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,620
but back then, I couldn't do anything.

246
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,580
To be more precise,

247
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,580
I only started looking for you

248
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,900
after I entered university.

249
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,300
I did it

250
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,340
in my spare time.

251
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,580
It didn't affect my studies.

252
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,860
Although we never met,

253
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,220
I've always been

254
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,020
paying attention to you.

255
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,300
(Personal Information, Na Fan)

256
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,740
Director Yang would share

257
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,020
your honor and success

258
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,660
(Past Awards)
with me.

259
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,140
I didn't participate in your growth,

260
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,540
but

261
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,780
I saw how excellent you are.

262
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
You really are great.

263
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,740
(Honor Certificate)

264
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,820
(First Prize)

265
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,620
Thank you.

266
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,240
You wanted to meet me so badly.

267
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,040
You must have
many questions for me, right?

268
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,740
Why sponsor me?

269
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,580
Because we

270
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,600
are fated.

271
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,220
How should I put it?

272
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,020
Fate brings us together.

273
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,900
We share a tragic destiny.

274
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,540
I'll tell you about it later.

275
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,100
Back then,

276
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,060
it was by chance

277
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,380
that I heard about you.

278
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,260
I thought

279
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,460
if I didn't offer you this warmth,

280
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,780
the black hole in your heart

281
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,540
and the cruel world

282
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,140
you'd face in the future

283
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,220
would tear you apart.

284
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,460
Thank you.

285
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,860
Do you also know

286
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,260
about my father?

287
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,340
Even if I didn't know,

288
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,460
I would've made the same choice.

289
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,340
The fact has proven

290
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,860
I have good judgment,

291
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,100
right?

292
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,780
But

293
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,660
why did you do it anonymously?

294
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,820
You were doing a good deed.

295
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,780
I didn't want my existence

296
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,180
to affect your growth.

297
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,700
Being anonymous

298
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,500
would keep it purer.

299
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,140
If you hadn't found me today,

300
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,460
we might never have met.

301
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,620
But I want to repay you.

302
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,630
If not for your kindness,

303
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,120
I wouldn't have been able to persist.

304
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,260
You made me realize

305
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,820
that there is someone out there

306
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,780
watching over me quietly.

307
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,300
To me,

308
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,260
this isn't just warmth.

309
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,780
It's a huge favor.

310
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,340
Although

311
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,460
I can't do anything now,

312
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,980
I'm still young.

313
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,700
If you need anything,

314
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,860
I can learn.

315
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,260
You've found me today.

316
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,900
It shows our fate is far from over.

317
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,940
So, there's no rush.

318
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,380
Right now, you just need

319
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,540
to study hard

320
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,660
and finish your education.

321
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
If you want to help me,

322
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,020
there will be opportunities.

323
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,660
She said she wanted to repay me,

324
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,900
but what could I ask of a child?

325
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,420
Anyway, from then on,

326
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,460
we've had contact.

327
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,620
What's wrong?

328
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,860
This isn't something to be ashamed of.

329
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,220
Why didn't you tell me?

330
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,940
Let me ask you.

331
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,100
Did you arrange

332
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,380
for Na Fan

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,380
to join Zixuan's company?

334
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,340
This isn't something
to brag about either.

335
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,380
I don't need to tell everyone.

336
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,460
Yes.

337
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,100
I suggested to her to go

338
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,700
to Ms. Wen's company,

339
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,740
but I didn't help at all.

340
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,940
That kid got in step by step

341
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,700
by herself.

342
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,460
Besides,

343
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,380
before the Tuan Island project,

344
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,780
I wasn't familiar with Ms. Wen.

345
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,900
What's going on with you today?

346
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,860
Na Fan

347
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,020
kidnapped Tao.

348
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,980
What?

349
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,260
Na Fan kidnapped Tao?

350
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,580
That's impossible.

351
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,420
Why would she do that?

352
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,140
Yeah.

353
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,740
Why?

354
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,540
Don't ask me. How would I know?

355
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,820
Na Fan said

356
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,620
she kidnapped Tao

357
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,500
because of you.

358
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,700
Because of me?

359
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,740
Fan.

360
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,780
I'm with Bao right now.

361
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,380
Tell us what you want to say.
Don't act impulsively.

362
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,900
Na Fan,

363
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,180
I'm with Binbin

364
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,460
and Tu Manjiang now.

365
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,020
Don't harm Tao.

366
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,820
I'll agree to whatever demands you have.

367
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,220
Okay? We can discuss this.

368
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,900
Bao, don't worry.

369
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,660
I only want money.

370
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,340
One million.

371
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,860
Once I get the money,

372
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,420
I guarantee
I'll return Tao to you unharmed.

373
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,460
Na Fan,

374
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,540
what exactly do you want?

375
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,180
Did you really kidnap Tao?

376
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,740
If you're in trouble,

377
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
just tell us.

378
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,380
We'll help you solve it.

379
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
This is a crime.

380
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,140
You're going to jail. Do you know?

381
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,900
Tu Manjiang, you jerk.

382
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,100
Shut up.

383
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,020
I'm telling you. Don't push me.

384
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,940
One day,

385
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,420
I will make you pay for Tianyi's life.

386
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,900
Na Fan.

387
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,740
What do you mean by that?

388
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,540
Tianyi is dead.

389
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,700
Tianyi is dead?

390
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,120
How did Tianyi die?

391
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,860
I don't know.
How would I know why he died?

392
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,180
She said it was because of you.

393
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,300
I don't know.

394
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,180
Let me ask her.

395
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,820
- Explain it.
- I'll ask her.

396
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,940
Na Fan,

397
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,300
are you crazy?

398
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,380
What are you talking about?

399
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,020
Are you trying to kill me?

400
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,140
Tu Manjiang,

401
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,540
if it wasn't for your threats,

402
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,060
I really wouldn't have gone so far.

403
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,340
To be honest,

404
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,280
I've wanted to kill you

405
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,540
for a long time.

406
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,500
Na Fan,

407
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,980
do you know what you're saying?

408
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,140
It's me. I'm your Uncle Man.

409
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,440
How can you pin a murder charge

410
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,620
on me?

411
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,740
If I've offended you in any way,

412
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,540
just tell me.

413
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,220
Why kidnap Tao?

414
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,060
Bao, Bin.

415
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,660
Let me tell you one thing.

416
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,780
Tu Manjiang is no good.

417
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,180
You can choose

418
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,300
to believe it or not.

419
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,820
Na Fan,

420
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,620
I just want to know

421
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,260
where Tianyi is.

422
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,580
Once I get the money,

423
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,760
I'll tell you where to find him.

424
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,980
Two hours later,

425
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,700
I want to see one million in cash

426
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,100
at the unfinished building

427
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,940
at Xingyu Pier.

428
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,820
Okay.

429
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,420
I'll have the cash ready.

430
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,180
I'll be there too.

431
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,860
No.

432
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,980
I want Tu Manjiang to come alone.

433
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,940
I'll bring the money

434
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
and arrive on time,

435
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,660
but you can't harm Tao.

436
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,300
Someone reported a case
at Guanhai Tea House.

437
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,460
I sent Fei Zai over.

438
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,380
Go ahead.

439
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,660
From what I know about Fan,

440
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,620
she must have been pushed to the edge

441
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,620
to do something so reckless.

442
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,280
Something must be wrong
between her and Tu Manjiang.

443
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,540
What have you got?

444
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,020
We found a caregiver.

445
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,900
She can prove

446
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,940
that Tu Manjiang was indeed recovering

447
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,460
during the time he disappeared.

448
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,100
This happened over a decade ago.

449
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,940
How does she remember so clearly?

450
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,860
Here's the thing. The caregiver said

451
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,220
she didn't know that Tu Manjiang

452
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,660
was allergic to mangoes.

453
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,480
She gave him a big glass of mango juice.

454
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,220
After he drank it, it almost killed him.

455
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,780
So, she remembers it clearly.

456
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,100
A severe mango allergy?

457
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,700
I once saw him drink

458
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,420
a big gulp of mango juice.

459
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,900
I didn't hear Bao mention

460
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,020
any allergic reactions.

461
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,900
How is it?

462
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,380
He got over the allergy
after the car accident?

463
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,300
The car accident

464
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,860
ruined his face

465
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,660
and even cured his allergy?

466
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,980
Do you think this current Tu Manjiang

467
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,840
is the same person as the one
before the car accident?

468
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,780
I'm saying this Tu Manjiang

469
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,540
is not the same person
as the one before.

470
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,340
There's no evidence.

471
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,460
This doesn't help.

472
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,700
Keep an eye on Bao Chenyan
and Tu Manjiang.

473
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,620
I'm coming right now.

474
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,980
Liang, can you do me a favor?

475
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,020
If you can, keep Fan safe.

476
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,900
Mr. Xing, everything is ready.
We can leave now.

477
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,020
I have to go now.

478
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,460
Bao, Bin.

479
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,540
One million.

480
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,700
It's ready.

481
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,140
It's all I've saved over the years.

482
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,460
Let's go.

483
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,620
Let's hurry and save Tao.

484
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,620
What are you waiting for?

485
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,980
Don't you want to know why?

486
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,260
I want to know too.

487
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,460
Let's go.

488
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,900
Hurry. Time's running out.

489
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,780
Let's go.

490
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,420
(Wen Binbin: Is it Tianyi?
How's the scene?)

491
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,540
(Yes, it's fine.)

492
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,900
Watch here. I'll go in and check.

493
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,260
- Okay.
- Both of you, follow me.

494
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,540
Did you notify the police?

495
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,620
Do you really want
to force Fan to her death?

496
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,260
This is the only way to save her.

497
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Tianyi is already gone.

498
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,100
I can't let anything happen to Fan.

499
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
What about Tao?

500
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,860
Have you thought about her?

501
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,700
Enough.

502
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,540
Stop talking.

503
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,980
It was me who had Bin notify them.

504
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,300
We'll cooperate however necessary.

505
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,340
We've arrived.

506
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
Where are you?

507
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,860
You and Bao get out of the car.

508
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,740
Let Tu Manjiang drive in alone.

509
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,620
Let him park by the door.

510
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,880
When I see him, I'll come out.

511
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,700
All units, pay attention.

512
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,780
There's a bomb on the hostage.

513
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,860
Don't act recklessly.

514
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,220
Have a bomb disposal expert come now.

515
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,060
Yes.

516
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,260
I've brought the one million

517
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,260
you wanted.

518
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,780
What happened to her?

519
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
She's fine.

520
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,180
She just fainted.

521
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,980
There are police all around.

522
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,980
To make it easier for us to talk,

523
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,740
I refused the police's request

524
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,100
to put on the equipment.

525
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,140
You're really disgusting in this act.

526
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,380
Only in this way

527
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,380
can I be temporarily safe,

528
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,220
and you can regain your freedom.

529
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,660
These years,

530
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,380
I'm lucky to have you by my side,

531
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,140
or I would've been lonely.

532
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,100
I've realized

533
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,700
I won't

534
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,980
see you anymore.

535
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,960
It makes me want to keep you here.

536
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,540
Go.

537
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,940
Take the money,

538
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,340
and go as far as you can.

539
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,620
Live the life you want.

540
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,750
Don't worry.

541
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,980
I'll do

542
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,260
what I promised you.

543
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,740
I'll leave,

544
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,180
but I won't go far.

545
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,420
I'll keep an eye on you

546
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,500
until you fulfill all your promises.

547
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,460
You've got the money.

548
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,380
Give me the remote control.

549
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,860
As long as I'm safe,

550
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,980
the bomb won't go off.

551
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,180
Twelve years ago.

552
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,700
August 26th.

553
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,380
Do you remember?

554
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,060
That night,

555
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,020
it was raining heavily.

556
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,940
Your father

557
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,820
had just made dinner for you.

558
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,260
Fan, dinner's ready.

559
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,020
Coming.

560
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,260
(Spirit Tablet of Wife Lin Fanshuang)

561
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,660
Mom, we're having dinner.

562
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,820
Who is it?

563
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,540
Who is it?

564
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,820
Who are you here for?

565
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,260
Why...

566
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,260
Why?

567
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,100
Do you know Wild Jiang?

568
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,460
You shouldn't have betrayed him.

569
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,860
Dad...

570
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,540
Dad!

571
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,260
Dad!

572
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,020
Dad!

573
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,540
Fan, run!

574
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,660
I promised you

575
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,140
I would bring your father's killer

576
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,460
to you.

577
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,660
Today,

578
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,580
I've done it.

579
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,980
Actually,

580
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,540
it was me

581
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,080
who killed your father.

582
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,420
Why?

583
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,980
Because your father

584
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,020
was a traitor.

585
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,020
Because of his betrayal,

586
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,660
my nephew Wild Jiang

587
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,380
and my sister's family

588
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,460
were all destroyed.

589
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,100
So, I had to kill him.

590
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,100
Actually,

591
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,380
you should thank me.

592
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,060
Over the years,

593
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,260
you've done so much for me.

594
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,140
Consider it as atoning for your father.

595
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,780
Do you remember the knife I gave you?

596
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,660
I used that knife

597
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,700
to kill your father.

598
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,580
Is this stab

599
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,740
enough to repay your debt?

600
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,060
Action.

601
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,140
Sorry.

602
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,380
Sorry.

603
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,700
Mr. Xing, everything's clear.

604
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,540
We'll leave now.

605
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,380
Good work.

606
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,660
Mr. Xing.

607
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,980
The bomb's been defused.

608
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,820
It was fake.

609
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,220
What about the hostage?

610
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,840
She's been sent to the hospital.

611
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,420
Dr. Zhang.

612
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,660
How is he?

613
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,040
His injuries are basically stable.

614
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,620
We need to ask a few questions.

615
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,980
Sure.

616
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Tu Manjiang,

617
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,140
we need to ask a few questions.

618
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,540
Just now,

619
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,860
before Na Fan left,

620
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,460
what did you say to her

621
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,800
that made her so emotionally agitated?

622
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,940
I just asked her

623
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,540
why she was framing me.

624
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,020
Why are you framing me?

625
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,220
Is it because I found out

626
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,620
your secret with Mr. Qi?

627
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
Stop talking nonsense.

628
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,740
I saw it with my own eyes

629
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,700
at Guanhai Tea House.

630
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
I even took a photo

631
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,060
and kept evidence.

632
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,140
What evidence?

633
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,780
This person

634
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,980
is the younger brother

635
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,460
of Qi Hanchen's confidant, Mr. An.

636
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,780
By chance,

637
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,340
I overheard

638
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,660
Na Fan and he

639
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,460
were talking

640
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,060
about Ms. Wen

641
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,220
being involved
in the Tuan Island project.

642
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,660
I thought

643
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,660
it was a dangerous signal.

644
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,460
Just now,

645
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,420
I warned her a bit,

646
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,860
telling her

647
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,060
not to let down Ms. Wen.

648
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,420
But unexpectedly,

649
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,380
she suddenly stabbed me.

Why didn't you go?

690
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,660
He's dead.

Tianyi cared about you the most.

693
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,060
You introduced us,

694
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,260
so we became such good brothers.

695
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,260
You let him protect Tao,

696
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,260
so he risked his life to block the stab.

697
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,060
I've thought about avenging him.

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,900

700
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,140
Na Fan really killed Tianyi?

701
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,980
Fan is already dead.

702
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,820
Two lives

703
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,340
just gone like that.

704
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,620
I really can't believe

705
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,000
Fan would do something like this.

706
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,620
Bao,

707
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,580
it's too coincidental.

708
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,100
I don't think this

709
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,180
is as simple as Man said.

710
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,940
Of course not.

711
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,780
The mastermind behind this

712
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,740
is definitely connected to Tu Manjiang.

713
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,460
Bao,

714
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,300
we need to figure out

715
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,140
the relationship between Fan and them.

716
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,460
We can get

717
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,100
a clear answer from Qi Hanchen.

718
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,100
We can only ask him.

719
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,580
(Fake Bomb in Tao's Kidnapping)
The results are out.

720
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,700
This is a fake bomb.

721
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,980
She chose to use this fake bomb
for the kidnapping.

722
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
We're not sure

723
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,860
of her real motive,

724
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,780
but is it possible

725
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,500
she never intended to harm the hostage?

726
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,140
Oh, right. Yu,

727
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,260
get the layout
of the unfinished building.

728
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,420
Sure.

729
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,180
(First Floor Layout)

730
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,330
(Na Fan's Location)
Look.

731
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,380
Let's analyze this

732
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,460
from the unfinished building's layout.

733
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,140
This is where we finally found her.

734
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,580
(Na Fan's Location)

735
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,540
She chose this corner

736
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,020
of the area.

737
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,780
From a criminal's perspective,

738
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,100
it was

739
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,940
the worst possible choice.

740
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,260
Why?

741
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,420
She left herself no escape route.

742
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,570
This doesn't fit the usual mindset

743
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,710
of a normal kidnapper.

744
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,320
Na Fan received formal training.

745
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,560
She shouldn't have done this.

746
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,940
Fei Zai,

747
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,300
what have you got?

748
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,100
Yu, show Mr. Xing the scene photos.

749
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,860
Mr. Xing,

750
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,500
based on the scene investigation,

751
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,300
there were only traces of a struggle
between Na Fan and Luo Tianyi.

752
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,980
No third party was involved.

753
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,580
Also,

754
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,540
I feel

755
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,220
like it's just too clean.

756
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,980
It's almost

757
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,660
as if no one else has been there

758
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,540
except for the two of them.

759
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,300
We've restored Luo Tianyi's phone.

760
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,340
I found the photos

761
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,900
he took before he died.

762
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,820
Take a look.

763
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,780
Based on the motorcycle

764
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,540
and the build and posture

765
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,860
of the motorcyclist,

766
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,380
we can confirm that Na Fan

767
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,980
was the one who shot Dian Lao'er dead.

768
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,700
She found him
after his stalking and spying,

769
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,020
but she didn't have to kill him.

770
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,980
Also, he got stabbed in the back.

771
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,220
If Na Fan

772
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,380
was really close

773
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,020
with Qi Hanchen,

774
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,740
she shouldn't have chosen

775
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,380
to kill at Guanhai Tea House,

776
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,180
because it'd be impossible to clean up.

777
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,940
Anyway, I think

778
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,580
we shouldn't rush to conclusions

779
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,740
about Na Fan,

780
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,540
but I'm certain something's off

781
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,660
with Tu Manjiang.

782
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,180
Keep investigating Tu Manjiang.

783
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,860
Expand the scope.

784
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,580
Without evidence,

785
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,180
all speculation

786
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
is pointless.

787
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,180
Understood.

788
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,260
One is my brother,

789
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,140
and the other is the girl I love.

790
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,740
Two lives.

791
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,780
They died in the blink of an eye.

792
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,220
I understand how you feel.

793
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,700
How did you move on?

794
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,180
Give them an explanation.

795
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,980
That's the only thing

796
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,220
we can do for them.

797
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,220
What have you found out?

798
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,180
Fei Zai

799
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,060
checked everything at the scene

800
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,260
where Luo Tianyi was killed.

801
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,960
We didn't find any evidence

802
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,260
of a third person being there.

803
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,720
Were there signs of it being staged?

804
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,620
However,

805
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,700
there are signs of cleaning up,

806
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,860
but we can't use it as solid evidence.

807
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,180
A flaw is good enough.

808
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,180
At least we'd know where to focus.

809
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,860
Actually, I think Tianyi's death

810
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,820
is related to Tu Manjiang.

811
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,220
The key now is I can't tell

812
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,380
if this current Tu Manjiang

813
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,120
is the same person
as the one from before.

814
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,210
If I can't figure it out,

815
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,020
I can't understand
the connections behind it.

816
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:46,990
We're trying to find out

817
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,240
about Tu Manjiang's identity.

818
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,460
How's Bao Chenyan now?

819
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,360
Tao is the most important person to him.

820
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,820
He's been enraged.

821
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,420
He won't let this go easily.

822
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,900
Actually, all the clues on the surface

823
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,860
now point to Qi Hanchen.

824
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,480
What are you planning to do?

825
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,540
Go along with it.

826
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,040
You guys investigate Tu Manjiang.

827
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,230
Bao and I

828
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,460
will pressure Qi Hanchen.

829
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,900
If he really has something to do

830
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,620
with Tianyi and Fan's case,

831
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,320
we'll definitely find contradictions

832
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,700
once we push him.

833
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,020
Don't go too far.

834
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,580
Make sure to maintain control.
