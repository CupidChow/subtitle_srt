00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:22,220
(Longmen BBQ)

2
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,530
The sun came up from the west.

3
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,460
Why are you treating me to a meal?

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,040
Don't overthink it.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,360
We'll be seeing each other often
from now on.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,640
This is just

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,040
to let myself get used to it.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,520
I'm adapting early.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,960
What do you mean by that?

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,520
Will I be back soon?

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,880
You're so eager.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,080
Aren't you living happily

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,120
with Bao?

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,040
That's not what I meant.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,000
Once the Tuan Island project is settled,

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,380
Bao will be on track.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,980
I won't make any difference.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,600
Bin.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,560
You and your sister...

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,400
What can I say about you two?

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,320
If you say one person
can influence a project,

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,640
I believe that.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,560
But can a project change a person?

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
- Do you believe that?
- I do.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,820
I think you're quite interesting.

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,440
If you're commenting on things

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,480
you understand,

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,320
I can accept that.

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
But if you're commenting on things

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,180
you don't understand...

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,840
Can you accept that?

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,200
Bin,

33
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,280
from your understanding of Bao Chenyan,

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,600
do you think

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,560
it's from a family member's perspective,

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,090
or a police officer's perspective?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,400
I realize you're quite extreme
with your words.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,360
This world isn't just black and white.

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
Think about it.

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,360
Even under the sun, there are shadows.

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,600
Forget about Bao.

42
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,670
Let's talk about my father.

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
Your father-in-law.

44
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,440
After he went into business,

45
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,760
he got into international trade.

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
Back then, many people went bankrupt

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,540
in international trade,

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
but he succeeded.

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,060
What perspective
are you looking at this from?

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,160
Then, when he took over
Tuan Island Market,

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,940
he never took a single protection fee.

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Sometimes, to build the market,

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,260
he even paid from his own pocket.

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,450
What perspective

55
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,700
are you looking at this from?

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
When there are things

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,160
I can't change,

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,440
I take on the role

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,720
of an objective observer.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,240
You're not an objective observer.

61
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,120
My sister is your wife,

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
and your daughter is my niece.

63
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,920
If you say it like that,
we can't talk anymore.

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,500
Right? You're just playing dumb.

65
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Alright, eat.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,400
I know what you're saying.

67
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,240
The black-and-white thinking
is a fundamental police attitude,

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
but it's not a survival rule.

69
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,920
If we compare this world to a farm,

70
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,420
then each of us

71
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,700
is a tree on that farm.

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,690
And all the dense trees together

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
form a forest.

74
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,020
As the sun moves,

75
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
every tree changes its shade

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,000
between black and white,
as well as shadow and light.

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Ultimately,

78
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,120
it's all for survival.

79
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
That's why my sister

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
and I firmly believe

81
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,160
that the Tuan Island project

82
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,400
can be Bao's lifeline.

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
From a survival perspective,

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,410
this project can completely dispel

85
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,600
the dark clouds around Bao.

86
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
Bin,

87
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
your black-and-white forest theory

88
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
is interesting.

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,130
But it only applies
on a theoretical level.

90
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,560
Have you ever thought

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
that the light you think you see

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,100
might actually be the nourishment
for the darkness?

93
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,460

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,460
=Episode 19=

95
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,490
Chen Yiming,

96
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,810
I'm warning you.

97
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,550
Perjury

98
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,440
carries legal responsibility.

99
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,300
If it weren't for the safety

100
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,660
of Hui and our children,

101
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,270
I wouldn't dare to say anything.

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
You just said

103
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,650
Bao Chenyan was behind everything.

104
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,720
What do you mean

105
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,310
by "everything"?

106
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,050
That gun

107
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,500
is where it all started.

108
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,420
(Binjiang Detention)

109
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,040
Who grabbed that gun?

110
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,530
I don't know.

111
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
From grabbing the gun

112
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,820
to the first shot being fired,

113
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,870
have you ever seen

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,980
that police gun?

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
No.

116
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,060
I had no idea
about the Birkin Paris gunshot

117
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,430
and Sun Changhai's appearance.

118
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,420
It wasn't until later that Bao told me

119
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,480
about Sun Changhai.

120
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,760
When was that?

121
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,140
It was just before you went to Ninghai.

122
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,760
Your task was simple.

123
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,680
No matter what,

124
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,330
you must not let them
get Sun Changhai to talk.

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,500
You either

126
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
help him escape,

127
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,200
or

128
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,490
make sure he stays silent.

129
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,580
Yes, Bao.

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,050
And one more thing.

131
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,000
You can touch anyone,

132
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,850
but not Binbin.

133
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,760
Understood.

134
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
Are you saying

135
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,120
the phone that tipped Sun Changhai

136
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
was from Bao Chenyan?

137
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,050
Yes.

138
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,220
(Stove Resto, Home-Cooked Food)

139
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,910
They're coming after you.
Hurry up and leave.

140
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,560
Chen Yiming,

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
the phone you mentioned

142
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,210
was used to call Sun Changhai,

143
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,240
and this phone number

144
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,040
also appeared in Wu Ajin's phone.

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,420
If Wu Ajin was brought in
by Bao Chenyan,

146
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,820
why would he turn around

147
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,970
and try to kill Bao Chenyan?

148
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,300
If Bao Chenyan

149
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,540
doesn't know Wu Ajin,

150
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,990
how did you get

151
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,860
his contact info?

152
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,440
I don't know.

153
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,220
I only used the phone Bao gave me

154
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,160
to contact Sun Changhai.

155
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,060
I didn't know Ajin at all

156
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,340
at first.

157
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
You didn't know him at first?

158
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,960
When did you start knowing him?

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Before we went to Xingyu Pier.

160
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Bao,

161
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,360
what if Bin didn't call me?

162
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,360
Do I still need to go to Xingyu Pier?

163
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,400
He'd definitely call you and Er'leng.

164
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
He couldn't

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,560
go alone.

166
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,900
So what would I do when I get there?

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Should I kill him?

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,520
With so many eyes there,

169
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,600
it's hard to make a move.

170
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Killing him is just a matter of time,

171
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,320
but not at Xingyu Pier.

172
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,680
It's Bin.

173
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,290
Chen,

174
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
hurry and bring people to Xingyu Pier.

175
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
I found the jerk who hurt Bao.

176
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,640
Got it.

177
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,530
Bao, I'm leaving now.

178
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,520
At the time, I didn't understand

179
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,660
why he insisted that I send someone

180
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,960
to hide in that alley

181
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,570
and keep an eye on that car.

182
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,840
Later, when I understood his plan,

183
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,690
I thought it was terrifying.

184
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,920
He designed everything.

185
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,650
Hello, Chen.

186
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,040
You're really something.

187
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
A guy just came and drove the car away.

188
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,120
I followed your instructions

189
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,240
and took the photos.

190
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,830
Send the photos to me.

191
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,740
OK, I'll send them to you now.

192
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
The photos are ready.

193
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm sending them now.

194
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
No need to send them to me.

195
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
Print the photos out

196
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
and send them by courier.

197
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
By courier?

198
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Send them to whom?

199
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
The Crime Investigation Unit.

200
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
Got it.

201
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,160
What's going on? Why so urgent?

202
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,420
Bro, your package is here.

203
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,800
Sign here. Come on.

204
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,360
(Delivery Room)

205
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
- Who sent this?
- I don't know.

206
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,660
The sender chose private shipping.

207
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,320
So you didn't see what they looked like?

208
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,360
No. I picked it up
from the package locker.

209
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,880
Go to Yiwei Motor.

210
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,760
I've prepared the tool for you.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
Ajin

212
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,560
can't stay alive.

213
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,440
Don't worry, bro.

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,960
If something happens,

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,960
I'll take care

216
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
of your child.

217
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,440
Wait for my news.

218
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,620
Where was the package sent from?

219
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,460
Where's the receipt?

220
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,860
There's a spare phone in my car's trunk.

221
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,800
I usually use it

222
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
to contact Bao.

223
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,330
I used that phone to send the package.

224
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,720
There should be a payment record.

225
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,360
Also,

226
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,040
the bar phone Bao gave me

227
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
is in that car.

228
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,140
Who took the photos for you?

229
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,330
Zheng Liu.

230
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,940
He recycles used phones

231
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,420
and computers at Huifeng Tech Market.

232
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,780
Does Bao Chenyan

233
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,260
know about Luo Jiahui?

234
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,660
Does he know

235
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,540
you two have a child?

236
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,500
Of course, he does.

237
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,750
Because he introduced

238
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,100
Hui to me.

239
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,060
Are you saying

240
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,300
Bao Chenyan set a trap for you?

241
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,580
She told me that she went there
with friends.

242
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,300
I didn't pay attention at first.

243
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,140
I felt something was off later.

244
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,340
By then, it was too late.

245
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,340
I'm not sure if it fits.

246
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,380
I'm not good at shopping.

247
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,980
Stop eating for now.

248
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,220
Let me listen.

249
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,800
The fetus isn't even fully formed yet.

250
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
- What are you listening to?
- Don't move.

251
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,500
I think I heard it.

252
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,220
He's kicking my ear.

253
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,900
Bao.

254
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,820
What's with that expression?

255
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,690
Don't you welcome me?

256
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,640
Here, Hui.

257
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,950
I bought you some bird's nest.

258
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,850
Thanks, Bao.

259
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,350
This place is nice.

260
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,630
It's way better than your old doghouse.

261
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,160
It's too coincidental.

262
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,200
I've known Bao for so many years.

263
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,380
He's come to my house
no more than three times.

264
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,650
At that time,

265
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,930
I had just rented the house.

266
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,370
Hardly anyone knew,

267
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,520
but he came anyway.

268
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,290
So, you mean

269
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,020
your meeting and relationship

270
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,980
with Luo Jiahui

271
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
were all Bao Chenyan's plan, right?

272
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
I love Hui,

273
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,240
and I love our child even more.

274
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,360
I couldn't take that risk,

275
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,670
so I had to go along with him.

276
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,400
So, what you're saying is

277
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,250
everything you did

278
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,420
was because

279
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,460
you were threatened
by Bao Chenyan, right?

280
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,340
Was Dian Lao'er's death

281
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,560
also planned by Bao Chenyan?

282
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,560
That didn't need planning.

283
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,120
It was a part of the whole scheme.

284
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,630
At first, Bao called me to the company

285
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,320
and told me about meeting Dian Lao'er.

286
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,200
When I saw Luo Tianyi,

287
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,240
I was confused.

288
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,440
Bao usually wouldn't have me

289
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,870
work with Luo Tianyi.

290
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,590
Then I got the message from him,

291
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,450
and I understood.

292
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,860
The incident
was blown out of proportion.

293
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,290
He just wanted me to slip away
in the chaos

294
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
and kill Dian Lao'er.

295
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,700
What about the money

296
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,810
in your mother, Cai Jinhua's account?

297
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,400
And

298
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,310
the cigarettes and alcohol

299
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,520
Luo Jiahui sold in the stores?

300
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,370
Where were they from?

301
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,450
Bao has a little brother named Wu Tong,

302
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,740
a chip exchanger he brought back
from Ao City.

303
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,410
They were really close.

304
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,260
Later, Wu Tong got into trouble

305
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,600
and fled to Southeast Asia.

306
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,060
He was involved in online gambling,

307
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,360
and it grew pretty big.

308
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,500
The money in my mom's account
was from him.

309
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,270
The contraband cigarettes and alcohol

310
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,640
came from the company warehouse.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,510
He never gave me money directly.

312
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Chen Yiming,

313
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,930
from your understanding,

314
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,640
what are Bao Chenyan's reasons
and motivations

315
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,920
for everything he's done to you?

316
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,510
I don't know. I really don't know.

317
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,880
I've known Bao for many years.

318
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,100
No one can guess

319
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,520
what he really wants to do.

320
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,640
But whatever he wants,

321
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,620
he'll make it happen,

322
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,200
whatever the method is.

323
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,240
How did you get in here?

324
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,080
Got drunk while eating BBQ,
and got in a fight.

325
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
What about you?

326
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,080
Yesterday, some guy blocked my car.

327
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,290
I got out and beat him up.

328
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,700
Now he's lying in the hospital.

329
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,520
Bao Chenyan, come out.

330
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,960
Mr. Bao, hello.

331
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,400
I'm the lawyer Ms. Wen sent

332
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,840
to handle your case.

333
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,600
Come with me.

334
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,500
(Holding Room)

335
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,430
Take a look.

336
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,070
Chen Yiming,

337
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,870
I'll say it again.

338
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,170
Perjury

339
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,960
carries legal consequences.

340
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,360
Officer,

341
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,990
I don't dare joke

342
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,580
with Hui's and our kid's lives.

343
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,770
You have to protect them.

344
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,600
You must protect them.

345
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,520
I beg you.

346
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,900
Isn't there any other way?

347
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,100
Does it have to be detention?

348
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,570
The other side is very firm

349
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,330
and refuses any form of reconciliation.

350
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,280
Minor injuries aren't criminal.

351
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
We'll accept a fine.

352
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,520
Can we bail him out?

353
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,880
Normally,

354
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,400
he can be released after being fined.

355
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,880
But the other side

356
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,160
has a complete video record,

357
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,460
and the impact is severe.

358
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,590
They also clearly said

359
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,880
they didn't want compensation,

360
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,090
and they just wanted justice.

361
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,120
Plus, Mr. Bao

362
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,800
has a past record of fighting.

363
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
This is tricky then.

364
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Five days of detention

365
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,520
is the best result

366
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,600
we can get.

367
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,360
Five days of detention.

368
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,400
The hearing will be held in five days.

369
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,120
This is essentially a dead end.

370
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
Can't it be postponed?

371
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,850
It was already delayed last time.

372
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
Another delay

373
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,960
would harm our credibility

374
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,120
and

375
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,330
give the opposition leverage.

376
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,880
Mr. Wang,

377
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,100
can you get him out before 2 PM?

378
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,860
Mr. Bao was

379
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,520
taken away before noon.

380
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
We should be able to get him out

381
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,200
around noon five days later.

382
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Good.

383
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,650
There are two weeks

384
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,580
before the rebid.

385
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,930
We still have a chance.

386
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,080
We can't afford any mistakes this time.

387
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,000
Otherwise, the Tuan Island project

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,400
will be handed over to our rival.

389
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,650
We need to make up
for the time Bao lost.

390
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,800
I'll go find Hai.

391
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,020
We can't do this without him.

392
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,250
(Hai Seafood Wholesale & Retail)
Uncle Hai!

393
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,780
I don't care what you think.

394
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,500
Just open the door.

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
Let's talk.

396
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,980
I told you.

397
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,480
I can't help with this,

398
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,920
and I don't dare to.

399
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,720
You should leave now.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
Uncle Hai,

401
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,740
didn't you say before

402
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,780
that the world is
all about personal connections?

403
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Why have you become

404
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,810
so indifferent now?

405
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,600
Uncle Hai!

406
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,040
What you're saying

407
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,860
is just making things worse.

408
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,400
Let's go.

409
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,040
Go where?
The problem isn't solved yet.

410
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,400
If we keep going on like this,

411
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,480
we'll never solve this.

412
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,900
(Hai Seafood Wholesale & Retail)

413
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,610
Mr. Xing,

414
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,790
what should we do next?

415
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,200
We can't determine the authenticity

416
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,380
of Chen Yiming's testimony.

417
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
Sort through the clues
and verify them one by one

418
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,720
before further interrogation.

419
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,120
Alright, we'll do it now.

420
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,000
What were you doing

421
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
between midnight and 2 AM

422
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,580
on March 1st?

423
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,720
I think I was sleeping at home.

424
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,690
Do you think we could've brought you in

425
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,050
if we had no evidence?

426
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,460
Chen gave me money

427
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,520
to keep an eye on things.

428
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,350
He said he'd pay 5,000 yuan for a photo.

429
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,480
How could I not do it?

430
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,500
Have you seen this person?

431
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,820
No.

432
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,510
Then please take another look.

433
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,010
Have you seen this person?

434
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,160
This person...

435
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes, I've seen him.

436
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,350
I gave him a massage at that time.

437
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,170
I don't know

438
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,390
what Chen was planning to do.

439
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,840
It has nothing to do with me.

440
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,940
I have records on my phone.

441
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,800
Let me show you.

442
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,790
This is strange.

443
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,420
You don't recognize him

444
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,220
in such a clear photo,

445
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,940
but you recognize the sketch of him

446
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,490
wearing a mask immediately.

447
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,420
We reviewed your store's

448
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,320
video footage from the past month.

449
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,810
There's no sign of this person.

450
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,730
This person is already dead.

451
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,040
Come clean.

452
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,480
He's dead?

453
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,430
Officer, this...

454
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,840
This has nothing to do with me.

455
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Chen told me to do this.

456
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,720
He gave me 20,000 yuan

457
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,140
and said

458
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,960
that if anyone asked

459
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,240
about the person in the photo,

460
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,990
I should send them to Xingyu Pier.

461
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,660
(Unit Chief's Office)
Mr. Xing,

462
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,180
we did find the order number

463
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,950
for the local delivery service
on Chen Yiming's spare phone.

464
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,850
According to the courier,

465
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,700
the time matches.

466
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,730
Has this phone number been checked?

467
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
Yes, it has.

468
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,530
This number did appear

469
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,560
on both Sun Changhai's

470
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,700
and Wu Ajin's phones.

471
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,520
Most importantly,

472
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,130
our tech experts have recovered it.

473
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,890
We found deleted message fragments

474
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,200
in the phone.

475
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,280
Here.

476
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,640
(Go to Yiwei Motor to get the tool
and kill Dian Lao'er.)

477
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,730
Is it confirmed
that Bao Chenyan sent this?

478
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,660
This is really suspicious.

479
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
Chen Yiming received this message,

480
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,370
but strictly speaking,
it wasn't a text message.

481
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,680
It was a network pop-up.

482
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
Someone compiled a program

483
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,530
and created software

484
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,800
capable of receiving messages

485
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,370
on this bar phone.

486
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,400
However,

487
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,670
this software

488
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,010
doesn't communicate
via phone number

489
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,200
but data traffic.

490
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,840
Someone like Bao Chenyan

491
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,600
can't program, right?

492
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,270
We've contacted the telecom company

493
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,960
and found

494
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,700
that the owner of this SIM card
is already deceased.

495
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
But the card hasn't been deactivated.

496
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,080
Upon further investigation,

497
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,000
we found

498
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,680
that the previous owner of this card

499
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,600
was the Wu Tong Chen Yiming mentioned.

500
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,280
Why wasn't this discovered earlier?

501
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,550
When Wu Tong applied for this card,

502
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,570
it was ten years ago.

503
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,160
It wasn't connected to the network.

504
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,850
Everything was manually registered.

505
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,640
Our tech experts only discovered this

506
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,990
after working with the telecom company

507
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,880
to trace the card's origin.

508
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,330
By the way,

509
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,460
this card is a cloned card.

510
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,280
You've been rambling so much.

511
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,590
What exactly does this mean?

512
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Xing, don't rush.

513
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,920
Here's the thing.

514
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,570
Logically,

515
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,420
a person

516
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,930
can't apply for two cards

517
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,080
at the same telecom company

518
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,410
because one would be deactivated.

519
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,950
But it's possible for someone

520
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
to clone their SIM card,

521
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,470
especially with old-style large cards.

522
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,080
Any tech market

523
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,920
can do it.

524
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,760
Am I understanding this correctly?

525
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,000
So, one phone number

526
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,580
is being used by two phones.

527
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,560
Right.

528
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,520
This confirms Chen Yiming's testimony

529
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,680
about not having contacted Wu Ajin

530
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,560
while Wu Ajin's phone

531
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,960
has this number.

532
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,940
(Injury, partner)

533
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,560
Alright, got it.

534
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,960
Is everything ready?

535
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,410
It's all taken care of
as per your instructions.

536
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,560
We've gained some

537
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,240
more trustworthy and practical friends.

538
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,320
Good.

539
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,400
Desire is the most loyal.

540
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,450
There are only two days left.

541
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,970
After all the effort put in,

542
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,750
I don't want to see

543
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,940
any unexpected events.

544
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,920
Especially that witness.

545
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,760
OK.

546
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,430
(Bao Chenyan)
Now, all the clues

547
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,680
point to Bao Chenyan.

548
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,460
If it really is him,

549
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,870
everything makes sense.

550
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,720
But what if it's not him?

551
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,020
That would be really terrifying.

552
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,160
This setup is so perfect.

553
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,240
Personally,

554
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,710
I don't think it's likely.

555
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,240
Regardless of whether Chen Yiming
is telling the truth,

556
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,510
one thing is objectively true

557
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,160
and

558
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,680
has been repeatedly confirmed.

559
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,240
What's that?

560
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
The entire situation

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,120
is related to Bin,

562
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,440
but all the danger

563
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,910
never comes near him.

564
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,180
(Wen Binbin)
That's the oddest and scariest part.

565
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,000
What if he doesn't cooperate?

566
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
The hearing is coming up soon.

567
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,690
We have to get him on board today.

568
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,560
If he doesn't open the door,

569
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,760
I'll wait outside until he comes out.

570
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,830
Uncle Hai.

571
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,360
It's still me, Bin.

572
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,700
I'm really begging you.

573
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,050
Please open the door.

574
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,120
You don't have to agree.

575
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,640
Let's at least meet.

576
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,040
We can't keep talking like this
every time.

577
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,200
Uncle Hai?

578
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,600
Uncle Hai?

579
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,720
Uncle Hai?

580
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,470
Bin.

581
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,130
Come here.

582
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,250
Hello, Uncle Long.

583
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,930
The suggestion
from your friend last time

584
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,060
was very effective.

585
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,130
Please pass on my thanks to him.

586
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Helping friends is what we do

587
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,000
for each other.

588
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,920
The reason I'm calling today

589
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,200
is that friend

590
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,360
asked me to remind you

591
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,120
that kidnapping the witness

592
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,040
won't solve the real problem.

593
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,400
Let's just focus on the result.

594
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,080
The process isn't as important.

595
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,640
Mr. Qi, do you like fishing?

596
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,840
That friend asked me

597
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,160
to pass this message on to you:

598
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,960
To catch a big fish,

599
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,200
the key isn't about the fish
biting the hook,

600
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,080
but the balance of tight and loose
when you reel it in.

601
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,750
If it's too tight,

602
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,600
the string breaks.

603
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,580
If it's too loose, the target escapes.

604
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,870
Right now,

605
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,580
you're a bit too tight.

606
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,560
Alright, thanks.

607
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,160
This person is really interesting.

608
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm quite curious about him now.

609
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,080
Boss,

610
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,140
are you sure you want to meet him?

611
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
This person's background

612
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,160
is unclear.

613
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,210
He's never stated any demands.

614
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Getting too close to him

615
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,400
might put you at risk.

616
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,280
At least for now,

617
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,820
he doesn't seem
to be hostile towards us.

618
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,840
I think

619
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,040
he's mostly

620
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,300
after the Tuan Island project,

621
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,940
trying to get a piece of the pie.

622
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,880
If it's just because of the project,

623
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,880
there's no need to kill.

624
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,680
Let's set up a firewall in advance

625
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,920
to ensure our interests are protected.

626
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,880
Especially that witness.

627
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,880
Keep a close watch on him.

628
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,800
No mistakes are allowed.

629
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,080
OK.

630
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,430
You took my horse.

631
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,650
It's hard now, right?

632
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,760
Come back.

633
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,440
Well, sir.

634
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,280
Excuse me.

635
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,920
Do you know Hai?

636
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
We're very familiar with him.

637
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,160
We get all our seafood from him.

638
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,940
His shop is right here,

639
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,120
the second one ahead.

640
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,760
I just went to his place,

641
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,840
but there was no one there.

642
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,600
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

643
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,840
Go, go.

644
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,840
He probably packed up.

645
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,560
I saw a minibus there at noon.

646
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,200
They might've taken everything.

647
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,080
If you want seafood,

648
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,360
you should come early tomorrow.

649
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,960
What minibus?

650
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,880
It's the seafood market's minibus.

651
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,640
It says "Jinzai Seafood" on it.

652
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,480
Yes, yes.

653
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,160
You guys continue. Thanks.

654
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,880
Go, go.

655
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,680
What a weird young man.

656

Xing.

657
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,660
We've organized

658
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,780
Chen Yiming's testimony

659
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,120
and the clues we've tracked down

660
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,960
in the past few days.

661
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,560
Tomorrow,

662
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,700
(Files)
Bao Chenyan's detention will be due.

663
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,560
We can apply for an arrest warrant

664
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,520
and detain him longer

665
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,780
to continue interrogating him.

666
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,880
Tell me.

667
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,680
If Bao Chenyan really is

668
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,280
the mastermind

669
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,700
behind all these murders,

670
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,400
how could he have

671
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
so easily exposed himself?

672
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,280
And things are passive for him now.

673
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,290
This doesn't make sense.

674
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,240
Xing,

675
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,920
you know

676
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,280
about the investigation process.

677
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,760
Though there are a lot of doubts,

678
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,400
currently, all the evidence

679
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,680
points to Bao Chenyan.

680
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,160
We have to take action against him.

681
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,920
Alright.

682
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,960
I'll report the testimony

683
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,000
and clues.

684
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,290
You get back to work.

685
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,920
Go on.

686
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,520
Okay.

688
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
How's it going?

689
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,240
Any leads from the police station?

690
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,560
I've passed on the vehicle info

691
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,520
to them.

692
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,320
But honestly,

693
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,360
we don't have any concrete evidence

694
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,280
that proves that car took Hai away.

695
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,600
So they said

696
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,970
they had to follow the rules

697
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,240
to find him.

698
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,520
What to do then?

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,480
We're running out of time, bro.

700
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,680
Right now, all we have are

701
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,280
those few characters on the car:

702
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,920
"Jinzai Seafood".

703
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,600
With so many seafood markets,

704
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,460
where are we going to find that?

705
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
Do you have any better ideas?

706
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,440
I don't.

what crime he's committed?

725
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,160

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,480
If necessary, we'll try again.

(Applicant, Wen Zixuan, Bao Chenyan)

759
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,240
(MorningStar Group provides
the Share Transfer Agreement.)

760
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,600
Regarding the transfer

761
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,120
of shares of Benniu Group to Wen Group,

762
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,400
we have thoroughly investigated

763
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,760
the demands of Wen Group,

764
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
carefully read through

765
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
the materials provided by Wen Group,

766
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,400
and fully considered opinions
from all relevant departments.

767
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,720
After in-depth discussions,

768
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,940
the conclusion is as follows:

769
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,600
Based on the current

770
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,800
materials and evidence,

771
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,480
Wen Group is unable to prove,

772
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,840
that the Share Transfer Agreement

773
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,960
signed by Mr. Chen Mingyuan,

774
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,400
Chairman of Benniu Group, is valid.

775
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,840
Sir, you cannot enter.

776
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,760
Why stop me? I'm an attendee. Move.

777
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,680
Sir, you cannot enter.

778
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,720
Sir...

779
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,560
What's happening?

780
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,160
Bao, Ms. Wen.

781
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,400
Dear leaders,

782
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,000
our key witness has arrived.

783
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,560
It was through him

784
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,840
that Mr. Chen Mingyuan handed us

785
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,080
the Share Transfer Agreement.

786
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,520
Are you sure?

790
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,240
I'll give you a red envelope.

791
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,240
Uncle Hai!

792
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,360
Untie me.

793
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,800
Are you okay?

794
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm fine.

795
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,320
I keep giving way,

796
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
but they still won't let me live.

797
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,720
Then I'll let them die.

798
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,080
Uncle Hai.

799
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,860
- Are you really okay?
- I'm fine.

800
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,640
Let's go.

801
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,740

802
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,740
(Chen Mingyuan's Handwritten Agreement)

803
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
At that time,

804
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,240
was this the document

805
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,440
that Chen Mingyuan asked you

806
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,520
to pass on to Bao Chenyan?

807
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,700
(Handwritten Agreement)

808
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,540
Yes, that's it.

809
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,480
Bao read the letter

810
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,600
right in front of me,

811
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,640
and I saw the contents too.

812
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,240
Also,

813
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,800
when Dian Lao'er wrote the letter,

814
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
I was right beside him.

815
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,000
Benniu is your life.

816
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,440
Is this necessary?

817
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,980
Do you really want to go this far?

818
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,240
Don't you understand me?

819
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,880
If it weren't absolutely necessary,

820
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,720
I wouldn't throw away

821
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,080
the company like this.

822
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,800
But if I still hold on to it,

823
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,480
I'll be dead.

824
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,420
(Chen Mingyuan)

825
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,360
Then why Bao?

826
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,560
Let me tell you.

827
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
In the underworld,

828
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,600
not many are good people.

829
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,640
(Xingyu Haiyu)

830
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,000
Others want my life,

831
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,600
and he also wants my life.

832
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,080
But Bao

833
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,680
knows how to reason.

834
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,800
He values loyalty.

835
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,360
So, I dared to bet
the company's shares with him.

836
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm swapping this

837
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
to get Bao

838
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,720
to give my father a promise.

839
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,400
I believe him.

840
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,760
Here.

841
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,880
I'll help with this.

842
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,840
Thank you.

(Hearing Moderator, Notary)

844
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,960
He told me at the time

845
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,400
that if anything happened to him,

846
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,440
this letter would be his will.

847
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,480
The previous agreement,
which he was forced to sign,

848
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,400
would no longer be valid.

849
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,240
The wine is ready, right?

850
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Today,

851
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,080
I'm so happy.

852
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,240
It's really not easy.

853
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,960
So,

854
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,000
today, we're getting

855
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,760
the most

856
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,840
expensive dishes

857
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,840
and drinking

858
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,320
the most expensive wine.

859
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,140
- How is it?
- Good.

860
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,630
- Thank you, Bao.
- Great.

861
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,000
Thank you, Bao.

862
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,960
Wait a minute, Bao.

863
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,600
You're treating us,

864
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,840
so who's paying the bill?

865
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,270
It's still the company's money.

866
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,240
It's everyone's money.

867
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,720
You're pretty sharp about money.

868
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,800
Why are you two
playing good cop, bad cop?

869
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,320
My sister

870
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,840
hasn't slept well for a week.

871
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,000
What did she say?

872
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,600
Bin is right.

873
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,050
This victory

874
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,540
is thanks to Ms. Wen's great efforts.

875
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,500
Ms. Wen.

876
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,060
- It's all family business.
- Cheers to you.

877
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,400
You're too kind.

878
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,520
That's right.

879
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,480
Behind the scenes is more important
than the spotlight, right?

880
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,280
Fan, cheers to you.

881
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,440
You've worked hard.

882
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,760
Now I see it clearly.

883
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,640
If selling his sister
would get him a wife,

884
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,320
I would've been sold 800 times by now.

885
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,960
Come on.

886
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,000
Shouldn't you toast me first?

887
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,640
Why?

888
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,350
I spent a night at the seafood market.

889
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Now my clothes smell like shrimp.

890
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,320
I should toast you.

891
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,160
Right?

892
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,510
Wait a minute.

893
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,040
I can't.

894
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,940
Do it now.

895
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,920
Wait a minute.

896
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,060
You've worked hard too.

897
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,160
Not hard at all.

898
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
This wine tastes sweet.

899
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,460
I've never had such sweet wine before.

900
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,880
Have you done?

901
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,450
Can we drink now?

902
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,960
Drink what?

903
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,560
- I'll decide?
- You decide.

904
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,160
I can't drink that.

905
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,000
Come on.

906
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,960
Let's mix it.

907
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,200
Drink.

908
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,680
- Drink!
- Drink!

909
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,280
Whoever drinks slowly
drinks another one.

910
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,840
Good. Come on, let's drink.

911
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,280
We'll drink for everyone.

912
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,320
Take it easy. Don't pretend to be tough.

913
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,000
Look at you.

914
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,920
You're a fountain!

915
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,400
What are you...

916
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,120
What are you doing?

917
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,380
Someone accused Bao Chenyan
of hiring a killer.

918
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,560
After our investigation,

919
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,600
we suspect Bao Chenyan

920
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,040
may be involved in two murders.

921
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
Please cooperate with us.

922
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,440
Wait.

923
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,060
Did Xing Liang send you here?

924
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,920
Shut up.

925
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,360
What's going on?

926
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,440
Wait a second.

927
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,720
Xing Liang,

928
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,080
how could Bao be involved
in a murder case?

929
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,800
He almost died himself.
How could he kill someone?

930
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,020
Why don't you say
we're all murderers in this family?

931
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,880
Now, all the evidence points to him.

932
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,600
Whether it's him or not,
we will investigate.

933
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,040
But he must be detained.

934
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,160
That's it.

935
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,180
(Xuan)
You...

936
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,720
What the hell?

937
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,240
Let's go.

938
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,620

940
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,360
Zixuan.

941
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,320
I didn't kill anyone.

942
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,440
I'll be fine.

943
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,810
