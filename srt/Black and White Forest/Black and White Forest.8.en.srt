1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,700
(Seven years ago)

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,400
I'll stay with you for a while.

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,240
How's it going Liu's matter?

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
When is the funeral?

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,880
The day after tomorrow.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,680
His parents will come.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,280
He was a good kid.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,760
He was clever,

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,240
reliable,

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,800
and polite.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,600
When he came to our house
for dinner last week,

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,800
I was talking about
finding him a girlfriend.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
God is cruel.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,040
Fortunately, he's not married.

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,760
If he had a wife and kids,
they'd be so desperate.

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
You always say

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,000
being a policeman
is not only your career

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
but also your dream.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,760
I respect that.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,640
But have you got what you deserve?

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,840
You've been a policeman for 10 years.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,480
You stayed in the same position
for 7 years.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
You get up so early

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,600
and go to bed so late

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,040
every day.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,200
Feifei still hasn't

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,200
called you Dad.

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,920
Count the days.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,720
How often do you come home?

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
Think about Tai.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,720
You were classmates,

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,880
and you became policemen
in the same year.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,320
He's a deputy director now.

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
Is it really worth it?

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
Tai is smart

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,120
and capable.

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
I'm not

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,240
as smart as him.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,240
I need to work hard.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,120
How much more effort do you need?

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,160
Liu was also hard-working,

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,640
and he was young,

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,240
but he died, right?

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,040
Do you know...?

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,760
Do you know I'm so worried about you?

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,400
I can't imagine.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,200
If you were the one lying there,

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,560
I'd lose my husband,

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,400
and Feifei would lose her dad.

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
I have a bad temper,

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,160
and I often yell at you,

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,170
but... but at least you're alive,

53
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,040
and I can yell at you.

54
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,920
If you die,

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,840
I can only yell at your grave...

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Stop.

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm sorry I made you worry.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
Since my father died,

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,560
I've been dealing with

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,800
the family business alone.

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
I'm tired.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm so tired.

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,160
Can you quit the job?

67
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,120
Can you come back to help me out?

68
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,640
I've been a policeman for 10 years.

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,440
I've never wanted to do anything else.

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
Xuan.

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,720
I've made up my mind.

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,920
I only want

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
to do one thing right in this life.

74
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
Please understand me, okay?

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,040
Are you afraid of gunshots?

76
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,880
If you're afraid,
stay away from it, okay?

77
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,300

79
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,460
(Tuan Island Market)

80
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,080
(Wen's Tuan Island Trading Co., Ltd.)

81
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,920
Aunt Chen,

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,280
have some water.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,400
Don't worry.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,520
I'll take Zhi back

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
safe and sound.

86
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,680
Wu.

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Come here.

88
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Bao is not here.

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
When you see them, don't start a fight.

90
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,880
You can accept any terms

91
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,320
except for

92
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,880
Tuan Island's

93
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,840
shares.

94
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
Okay.

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,280
Xi.

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
I think you're

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
the most educated man

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
in this team.

99
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
And you're handsome.

100
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
We're here

101
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
for one thing.

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Release him.

103
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,160
Bao said he could be

104
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,040
responsible.

105
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,320
How much do you want?

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,080
Name the price.

107
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,920
Bao is so generous.

108
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
Bur Lao'er also said,

109
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,400
if you want the man,

110
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
give us the shares of Tuan Island.

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,320
Are you dreaming?

112
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,280
How dare you ask for the shares?

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,480
Stingy, stop bluffing.

114
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,000
We also talked to his mother.

115
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,360
If she wants her son,

116
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
give us the shares.

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
No other way.

118
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
Stop acting like

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
a disgusting lickspittle!

120
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,480
Listen, fight or die.

121
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Do you want me to feed you to fish?

122
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
Retreat.

123
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
Calm down.

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,280
Let's go!

125
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,060
(Crispy Chicken)

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,680
Sorry to keep you waiting.

127
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Try this.

128
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,840
I just had a meal.

129
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm full. You can eat it.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
How's it going?

131
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,600
After you left,

132
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,160
only an old man came,

133
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
and he left in a minute.

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't think

135
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,400
the fried chicken is delicious.

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Hello, Mr. Xing.

137
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm on it. Don't worry.

138
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
Mr. Xing,

139
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,600
we spotted him.

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
He's heading north.

141
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,000
Follow him.

142
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,240
Seize the opportunity.

143
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
Mr. Zhou,

144
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
he said the suspect

145
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
was heading north.

146
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
- Chen.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
Cross Sanbao Street

148
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,000
and keep an eye on the exit.

149
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,200
Anyway, don't let him

150
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
out of your sight.

151
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
- Catch him at the right time.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,160
- Go.
- Okay.

153
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,030
You too.

154
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,460
(Crispy Chicken)

155
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,600
Tianyi,

156
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,680
a young boy

157
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,360
just bought a lot of chicken with cash.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,040
I'll follow him.

159
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,480
Attention, attention.

160
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
The target has shown up.

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,480
The target has shown up.

162
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
Get him.

163
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,240
Hurry.

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,520
Who are you?

165
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Who are you?

166
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,400
You don't know me.
Why are you arresting me?

167
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,040
What's wrong with you?

168
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,320
Captain Zhou,

169
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,190
I saw him at the birthday party

170
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,170
of Sun Changhai's uncle.

171
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,520
You've finished your work.

172
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,640
Get out.

173
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,100
(Sun Changhe)

174
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
Mr. Xing.

175
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
Take him to our car.

176
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,120
Go.

177
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
- Sir.
- Okay.

178
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,200
Where are you going?

179
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
See that van?

180
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
Go 50 meters and stop.

181
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,520
Can't you walk?

182
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,920
Or are you cheating on your wife?

183
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
My grandpa can live a long life

184
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,680
because he never minds
others' business.

185
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,720
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,920
Officers,

187
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,640
I've told you everything I know.

188
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,160
I've only been here for half a year.

189
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,560
I don't have friends.

190
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,560
Well,

191
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,880
my cousin asked me
to send something for him.

192
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,150
Okay?

193
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
That's all?

194
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,280
I'm asking you one last time.

195
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,120
Where is your cousin?

196
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,720
How should I know?

197
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm just a delivery guy.

198
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,160
How can I know where my boss is?

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,720
If I do, I'll tell you.

200
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
No one wants to go to jail.

201
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,440
You know what to do.

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,680
Let him take it.

203
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,700
(Boss)

204
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,560
Hello.

205
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Did you get it?

206
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,800
Yes.

207
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,280
Should I send it to
Liujiazhuang or Gaoheyan?

208
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,680
Gaoheyan.

209
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,120
Talk to you later.

210
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,520
Officers, I'll tell you everything.

211
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,920
Gaoheyan

212
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
is five kilometers north of Gaojiatun.

213
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,680
There's a river bank.

214
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,140
(Wen Binbin)

215
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,040
Mr. Xing, it's Bin.

216
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,480
I found him.

217
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,520
Come over.

218
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,460
(The Big Market)

219
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,920
Ten minutes ago,

220
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,280
the target headed north
via 203 Village Highway.

221
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,140
(203 Village Highway)

222
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Keep me informed.

223
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,480
Thanks.

224
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,360
Chen, turn right at the next corner.

225
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,520
No problem.

226
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:52,780
(Emergency Room)

227
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,120
Mr. Xing, over here.

228
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
Bin.

229
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,680
Bin.

230
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,580
Are you okay?

231
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,620
It's Tianyi.

232
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,000
What have you done?

233
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,760
Why did you get involved?

234
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,600
Don't you know the consequences?

235
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,480
Now you're talking about consequences.

236
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,640
If I had thought about it,

237
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,000
I wouldn't have let him

238
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,120
get away again and again.

239
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,320
Psycho.

240
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,720
If I had thought about it,

241
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,280
I wouldn't have let him escape
from Binjiang to Ninghai.

242
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,880
If I had thought about it,

243
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,920
I wouldn't have taken the risks
to drink with Gu Dadao

244
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,360
for clues.

245
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,330
You don't have to think about yourself,

246
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,960
but what about others?

247
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,240
If you had cared about others,

248
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,440
would your bro have been lying here?

249
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,080
What about Liu?

250
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,160
Why didn't you say this when

251
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,080
he took the bullet?

252
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,440
He was your bro, wasn't he?

253
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,200
Bin!

254
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,120
You've gone too far!

255
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Mr. Xing.

256
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,640
It's not what he meant.

257
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
Put them on the phone.

258
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,040
Don't be angry.

259
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
Mr. Xing, Bin,

260
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,280
Ms. Wen wants to talk to you.

261
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,380
(Ms. Wen)

262
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,530
From now on, I'll participate in

263
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,760
every mission!

264
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,560
No one can stop me!

265
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,720
Hello.

266
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,180
(Na Fan, Xing Liang)

267
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,840
I heard your conversation.

268
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,920
However, I don't understand.

269
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
At this point,

270
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,960
aren't you supposed to work together

271
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,120
to get the bad guy?

272
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,040
Why are you arguing with each other?

273
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,320
I don't care

274
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,360
what grudge you have,

275
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,240
but don't embarrass me, okay?

276
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,160
From now on, I'll participate in
every mission.

277
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,400
No one can stop me.

278
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,520
I wasn't trying to stop you.

279
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,680
I know I can't.

280
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,990
Therefore,

281
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,640
Na Fan will follow you.

282
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,880
It can put my mind at ease.

283
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
Are you serious?

284
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,200
It's not appropriate.

285
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,600
Who's in charge?

286
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,920
I can't hear you.

287
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,020
(Na Fan, Xing Liang)

288
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Hello.

289
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,960
Xuan,

290
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
it's not only inappropriate

291
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,360
but also fundamentally wrong.

292
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,480
Don't tell me it's not appropriate.

293
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,440
I know the rules.

294
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,960
But can you stop him?

295
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,120
Can I stop him?

296
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,160
Whether you like it or not,

297
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,240
he'll do it anyway.

298
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
It's safer for him to stay

299
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,400
with you than being alone, right?

300
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
How about this?

301
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
Tie him up and lock him.

302
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,080
I'm all for it.

303
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,840
Okay, I got it.

304
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,800
I'll think about it.

305
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,760
Hello.

306
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,200
Mr. Xing,

307
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,920
we lost him in the northern suburbs.

308
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,520
It's a T-junction

309
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,360
with no surveillance.

310
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,060
I don't know which way to go.

311
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,970
Bin,

312
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm not trying to criticize you,

313
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
but you

314
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
really went too far.

315
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,800
How could you say that?

316
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
I'll talk to him.

317
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,700
(Emergency Room)

318
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,200
Fan.

319
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,080
You have to help me.

320
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,440
I'd love to,

321
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,160
but Mr. Xing doesn't agree.

322
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,720
You're right.

323
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,240
You don't have to go.

324
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,680
No way.

325
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Didn't you hear Ms. Wen's words?

326
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm not doing this alone

327
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,440
but going with the team.

328
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,720
I'm with Xing Liang.

329
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,200
Even if you don't trust me,

330
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
you have to trust him.

331
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,120
If anything happens,

332
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,640
he'll be my shield.

333
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,680
No, I can't do this.

334
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,480
Ms. Wen won't be happy.

335
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,320
Ms. Wen is worried about my safety.

336
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,760
Now that I'm safe,

337
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,320
she won't worry anymore,

338
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,720
right?

339
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,400
Besides,

340
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,640
Tianyi is seriously injured.

341
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,200
He needs you.

342
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,760
If you go with me,

343
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,160
won't you worry?

344
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm so worried about him.

345
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,140
But Ms. Wen...

346
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,320
- I...
- Fan.

347
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,760
Sometimes,

348
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,400
it's okay to lie for the greater good.

349
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,040
Deal with Ms. Wen for me.

350
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,960
I'll work with the team

351
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,160
to arrest the criminal,

352
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,560
and you'll take care of Tianyi.

353
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,480
It's a win-win situation.

354
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,360
I know I can't stop you,

355
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,920
but

356
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Mr. Xing needs to follow the rules.

357
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,310
Look,

358
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,320
I can stay,

359
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,760
but you

360
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,840
have to keep me informed.

361
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,930
In addition,

362
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,320
you have to protect yourself.

363
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,880
No problem. I swear

364
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I'll keep you informed,

365
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,480
and I won't get hurt.

366
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,040
I'll arrest the criminal

367
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,840
and take care of our brother.

368
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,080
Our brother?

369
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,480
He's my brother.

370
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,200
It's the same.

371
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,280
He'll be my brother soon.

372
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,800
Bin,

373
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,880
I know you're capable,

374
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,600
but you need to be careful

375
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,080
with Sun Changhai.

376
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,600
How can I steal

377
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,440
Captain Xing's thunder?

378
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
Mr. Xing is here.

379
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,840
Mr. Xing.

380
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,520
Did you find him? Why did you stop?

381
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,280
Based on the analysis, Mr. Zhou thinks

382
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,840
he's heading to Da An Alliance.

383
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,360
There's a big forest.

384
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,640
It'll be hard to find him.

385
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Both roads lead to Da An Alliance.

386
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,080
Which way should we go?

387
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,320
It's not Binjiang.

388
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,880
There are not many places

389
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,240
for him to take a break.

390
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,200
From here to Da An Alliance,

391
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,960
there are only two gas stations.

392
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,600
197 National Highway's

393
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Pingling Town and Tumuji.

394
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,240
I don't think he'll go on

395
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,360
the highway at this point.

396
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
It must be Tumuji.

397
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,240
Fei Zai.

398
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,000
You're thinking like a policeman.

399
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,160
We need to think about it

400
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
from his point of view.

401
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm sure he thinks

402
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,120
the best place to hide

403
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,440
is in plain sight.

404
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,840
Liu Yong.

405
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,880
Ask Mr. Zhou to contact

406
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,120
Pingling Town police station

407
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,600
and let them search the place.

408
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,600
(Xingyu Pier)

409
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,560
Dian Lao'er!

410
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,760
Don't be a coward!

411
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,600
Come out now!

412
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,040
What a scene.

413
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,520
Bao.

414
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,120
Are you going to rob me?

415
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,360
Did you take Zhi away from the casino?

416
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,440
What the hell?

417
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,760
I've told you a million times.

418
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,840
He cheated in our casino.

419
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,520
Well, we caught him in the act,

420
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,360
okay?

421
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,400
We can pay for that!

422
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,800
We don't want money.

423
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,000
We want shares.

424
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,800
Screw it!

425
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,040
What the hell? I've told you.

426
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,960
Listen,

427
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,200
let me repeat it.

428
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,600
You'll never

429
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,000
get the shares!

430
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,440
Then we have to follow the rules.

431
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Cut off his arm!

432
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,640
Come on!

433
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,360
Don't waste time!

434
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
Tell me.

435
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,200
Sign a contract or fight?

436
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,400
Go to hell!

437
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,240
Let's die together!

438
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
Dian Lao'er,

439
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,160
stop being crazy.

440
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Bao,

441
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,400
when did you become a coward?

442
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,400
Is the accountant

443
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,680
in charge now?

444
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,000
If we can't solve this today,

445
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,320
auntie,

446
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
I swear

447
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,040
I'll make you suffer.

448
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,520
I'll make sure

449
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,280
you have nightmares every night.

450
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,040
Okay?

451
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,010
Where is he?

452
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,040
- Son!
- Mom!

453
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,360
Help!

454
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,200
Zhi!

455
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,220
- Mom, help!
- Zhi!

456
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,720
Son!

457
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
Zhi! My son!

458
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,160
Mom!

459
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,240
Help!

460
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,640
My son!

461
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,480
Save my son!

462
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,400
Zhi!

463
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,200
You're...

464
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,240
You're making me look like a monster

465
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,600
who wants to destroy your family.

466
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,120
Auntie,

467
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,440
it's very simple.

468
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,480
You only need to sign the deal,

469
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,640
and it'll be over.

470
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,920
I'm begging you!

471
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,840
Please

472
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,360
let him go!

473
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,160
Please sign it!

474
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,880
- Mom!
- Please!

475
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,040
You can

476
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,480
cut my hands off!

477
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,120
Why would I do that?

478
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,840
He made a mistake.

479
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,720
His hands should be cut off.

480
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,960
Sign it.

481
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,880
Mom, help!

482
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,200
Help! Mom!

483
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,960
Bao!

484
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
Bao!

485
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,560
Get up.

486
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,040
Get up!

487
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,240
Bao,

488
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,640
he's my only son.

489
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,640
You watched him grow up.

490
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
Maybe he's not a good son,

491
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,360
but I can't watch him die!

492
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,400
Will you listen to me?

493
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,960
I will. I will.

494
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Give him the shares!

495
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,520
I don't blame you.

496
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
See?

497
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,040
Bao said yes.

498
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,360
- Come on. Sign it.
- Bao.

499
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,200
The shares...

500
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,950
Come on.

501
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,200
Just sign it.

502
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,880
Come on.

503
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,560
Okay.

504
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Money.

505
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,720
Son!

506
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,520
Son!

507
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,520
Auntie, get up.

508
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,400
Let's go. Come on.

509
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,400
Mom!

510
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,120
Bao,

511
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,040
didn't you say

512
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,680
I couldn't get the shares?

513
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,920
I did it.

514
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,320
Bao, take care!

515
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,820
(Qin Yuan Chun)

516
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,960
Mr. Xing, I'm Liu
from Pingling Town police station.

517
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,160
Hello, Liu.

518
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,000
Hello.

519
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,240
The suspect came here

520
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,400
at 3:00 a.m. this morning.

521
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,720
I think he's sleeping.

522
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,440
Mr. Li is keeping an eye on him.

523
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,400
He's waiting for you.

524
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,800
Attention, attention.

525
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,400
We've spotted the suspect.

526
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,640
We've spotted the suspect.

527
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,040
Stay sharp and be prepared.

528
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,160
Come on. Hurry.

529
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,200
He's in Room 201.

530
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Okay.

531
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,600
Don't move!

532
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,320
Stop!

533
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,600
Fei Zai!

534
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,760
Are you okay?

535
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,880
I'm fine.

536
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,760
I'm fine.

537
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,520
Bin, be careful!

538
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,480
Stop!

539
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,400
Officer Wang.

540
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,520
Officer Wang.

541
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,240
Officer Wang.

542
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,120
He's in surgery,

543
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,200
but I think he'll be fine.

544
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,400
We'll interrogate him.

545
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,360
It's worth it.

546
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,760
I've told you

547
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,760
if you try,

548
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,120
wherever he goes,

549
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,720
you'll capture him.

550
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,120
Mr. Tai.

551
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,240
We've got him, but...

552
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,200
but the gun is still unclear.

553
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,920
Now that you've got him,

554
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,760
you'll get some information.

555
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,120
Don't be too hard on yourself.

556
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,960
We have seven days,

557
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,400
right?

558
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,400
I believe you.

559
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,800
I've prepared fine wine

560
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,240
for the celebration.

561
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,280
You have no idea

562
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,120
how terrifying it was.

563
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,840
Besides, he was hiding

564
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
in the dark.

565
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,880
It was so dangerous.

566
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,400
Then I saw a guy

567
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,960
fall in front of me.

568
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,320
Anyone would be scared.

569
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,800
But not me.

570
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,520
I've never been scared since I was born.

571
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,160
Then I picked up the gun and chased him.

572
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,520
Guess what?

573
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,880
I got that guy

574
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
in the end.

575
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,280
Right?

576
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,240
How... How's the food?

577
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Not bad.

578
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
It's acceptable.

579
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,960
Are you hungry?

580
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,600
Of course, bro.

581
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,040
You didn't tell me.

582
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,360
- Come on.
- You didn't ask...

583
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Come on.

584
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You can only smell it.

585
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,400
The doctor has said
there's fluid in your stomach.

586
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,640
You're on

587
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,760
a liquid diet.

588
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,760
Come on. Have some water.

589
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,080
- No.
- Come on.

590
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,520
- No.
- Come on, let me help you.

591
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,640
Help yourself.

592
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,400
You've been talking too much.

593
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,840
Your mouth must be dry.

594
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,240
It's good.

595
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,360
Hey, can't you stop

596
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,240
making noises?

597
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,800
Fine.

598
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,520
It's good.

599
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
As a killer,

600
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,560
you must've made
many achievements, right?

601
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,160
No matter what you do,

602
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,160
it's hard to

603
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
make achievements

604
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,680
and be famous.

605
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,440
Don't you agree?

606
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,640
This guy...

607
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,720
What did he do?

608
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,360
Why were you so cruel?

609
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,040
Hey!

610
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,760
You hit me! Apologize now!

611
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,320
Am I wrong about this?

612
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,640
Are you wrong?

613
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,680
He didn't do it.

614
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
I did it.

615
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,120
Thank god.

616
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,520
I thought I wronged you.

617
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,640
But I'm so curious.

618
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,520
How did he

619
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,280
offend you?

620
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,440
Why did you do that for free?

621
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,400
He was rude.

622
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,880
He needed a lesson.

623
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
I heard

624
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
when you were a kid,

625
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,680
your mother wanted to leave your father,

626
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,560
so she left you

627
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,040
alone.

628
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,040
Mom.

629
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,400
Mom!

630
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,240
Then she died

631
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,680
in a car accident.

632
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,240
Your father was faithful.

633
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,080
He left you

634
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,160
and killed himself.

635
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,480
Dad!

636
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,000
You were only

637
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,160
five years old, right?

638
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,400
Losing loved ones is painful.

639
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,520
But you killed
other people's loved ones,

640
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,600
and it was also painful for them.

641
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,000
Right?

642
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't know about them,

643
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,000
but I'm not in pain.

644
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,840
You got me.

645
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,080
I was unlucky.

646
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,200
Since I become a killer,

647
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,200
I've never expected to die of old age.

648
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,160
It's not because

649
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,720
he's pessimistic.

650
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
Normally, a killer

651
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,520
can't live as long

652
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,480
as your uncle.

653
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,440
Speaking of which,

654
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,680
it's not because

655
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,040
your uncle is capable.

656
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,840
We don't want to investigate him.

657
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,320
If we do,

658
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,080
do you think he'll get away?

659
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,920
Right?

660
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,320
Come at me.

661
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,840
My uncle has nothing to do with it.

662
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,520
We came for you.

663
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,240
Did you forget it?

664
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,720
Let me remind you.

665
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,720
A police gun is missing because of you.

666
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,360
If we can't find it,

667
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,840
none of us

668
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,880
can get away.

669
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,640
Where is the gun?

670
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,720
I threw it away.

671
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,320
Where and when did you throw it away?

672
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,000
Before I left Binjiang,

673
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
I left it at the cross-sea bridge.

674
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,520
Uncle Long is the middleman, right?

675
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,160
Haven't seen him.

676
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,040
I only know he's a tough guy.

677
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,360
I'm not sure about that,

678
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,040
but

679
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,120
he's smarter than you.

680
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
You... You can't get him.

681
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,160
Sun Changhai,

682
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,120
we came all the way from Binjiang.

683
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,400
Do you really think we're idiots?

684
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,480
It's okay.

685
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,520
You don't have to tell us
where the gun is.

686
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,480
Someone will tell us.

687
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,760
Okay.

688
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,840
Enough about the gun.

689
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,400
I have a question.

690
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,000
When we were chasing you in Hegu,

691
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,000
you could've escaped,

692
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,160
but you didn't shoot him.

693
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,200
Did someone tell you

694
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,600
not to hurt Wen Binbin?
