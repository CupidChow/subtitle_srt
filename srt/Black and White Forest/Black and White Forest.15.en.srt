00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,780
(21 years ago, Binjiang Child Welfare)

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,180
(Luo Tianyi, teenager)

3
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,040
You're sick
but not taking your medicine.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,160
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,800
Drink it.

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,340
(Na Fan, teenager)

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,980
How can you get better without medicine?

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,820
Hurry and drink it.

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,960
Hurry.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,680
Hurry and drink it.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,080
So you'll get better.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm not sick.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,080
Only kids who are liked
by adults get sick.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,720
They like

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,160
obedient kids

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,640
who are good at studying.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
But I don't like school.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,360
I'm too dumb

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
to learn.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,120
Sis,

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,540
if the director hadn't asked you
to take care of me,

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,240
you wouldn't even want to play with me.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,320
At first,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,300
it was because of the director,

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,520
but it wasn't later.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,040
Why?

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,520
Maybe

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,020
because I'm not an adult either.

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,400
When we grow up,

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,180
I'll still want to play with you.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,160
We'll be the best friends in the world.

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay.

33
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,180
Let's make a pinky promise.

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,080
Pinky promise.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,480
A pinky promise doesn't change

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,040
even after a hundred years.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,880
Stamp it.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,040
Where are you going?

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,480
It's already past midnight.

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
It's your birthday.

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,160
I've been saving snacks for a long time,

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,540
waiting to give them to you today.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
Snacks?

44
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,630
Yeah.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
Let's go.

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,580
But you still have a fever.

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
Alright, alright.

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,500
=Black&White Forest=

49
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,500
=Episode 15=

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
Surprised?

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,000
Not really.

52
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,280
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,840
About the killer,

54
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,440
do you have anything to tell us?

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,800
The crime scene

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
was far worse than this photo.

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,480
Even our veteran coroner said

58
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,200
he had never seen

59
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,440
such a shocking scene.

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,840
Such a pity.

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,140
They were so young

62
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,460
but died

63
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,580
in a foreign place.

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,660
But the killer

65
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,300
is still on the loose.

66
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,860
But I can tell

67
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,180
that your two brothers

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,340
really held their ground.

69
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,020
They didn't bring shame
to the Sun family.

70
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,060
However,

71
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,860
their big brother

72
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,740
does have

73
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,020
a good mindset.

74
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,580
He's not in a rush to catch the killer

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,860
and avenge them,

76
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
right?

77
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,540
Uncle, have some tea.

78
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,540
They asked me

79
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,420
to send a sound person over.

80
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,820
After thinking it over,

81
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,820
I think you're the one.

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,340
Alright, leave it to me. Don't worry.

83
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,900
Also, this job is a bit special.

84
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,780
Once you get there,

85
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,900
just do whatever they ask you to do,

86
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,540
and say whatever they ask you to say.

87
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,820
Why?

88
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,580
Why?

89
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,660
Remember when your little uncle

90
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,180
was set up in Shenchuan by enemies?

91
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,740
He almost lost his life.

92
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,100
It was only thanks to their help, right?

93
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,580
They once

94
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,900
helped us.

95
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,580
Got it.

96
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,020
And this time,

97
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,700
you don't need to bring any weapons.

98
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,060
They've got everything.

99
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,580
Uncle, let's talk to them again.

100
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,060
I'm afraid their things might...

101
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,180
Nothing to talk about.

102
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,660
This was specially ordered
by the master.

103
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,100
What else am I missing?

104
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,940
Oh, right.

105
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,740
He's called Uncle Long.

106
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
He's the middleman.

107
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,460
He'll take care of things

108
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,660
down there.

109
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,940
Remember.

110
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,220
If anything goes wrong,

111
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,700
what you can tell the police

112
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,500
stops at Uncle Long.

113
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,940
Got it.

114
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,340
When you

115
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,180
make up your mind,

116
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,100
just call us.

117
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,460
Uncle Long.

118
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,340
The contact is Uncle Long.

119
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,900
I haven't met him,

120
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,580
but we've made calls.

121
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,260
I can give you the number.

122
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,940
(Tuan Island Market)

123
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
What's going on?

124
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,180
Who upset you?

125
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,860
Can you man up?

126
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,900
Come on.

127
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,380
Look at me.

128
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,540
With my look,

129
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,260
it's very hard for me

130
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,780
to become a woman, right?

131
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,300
If you're a man,

132
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,300
don't hide anything from me.

133
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
I just saw

134
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,900
Big Eye Chen and Tianyi

135
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,100
holding a phone,
looking at a map near Xingyu Pier.

136
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,620
As soon as they saw me,

137
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,020
they quickly put their phones away.

138
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,500
What's going on? Tell me.

139
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,220
I can tell you,

140
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,400
but you have to promise me one thing.

141
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,260
What is it?

142
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,620
You can't follow me.

143
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,540
Is this dangerous?

144
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,100
No more talk.

145
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,160
Will you promise me or not?

146
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,080
Alright, I promise you.

147
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,380
Tell me.

148
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,460
Dian Lao'er just called me,

149
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,900
asking to meet.

150
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,140
When?

151
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,700
An hour and a half later.

152
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,820
That fast?

153
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,220
Your injury isn't healed yet.

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,740
He's in a hurry.

155
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,540
I think

156
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,620
he's planning to run.

157
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Why would he come to you
if he's running?

158
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,000
Is he trying to frame you
before he leaves?

159
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,500
I knew it.

160
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,460
What do you know?

161
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,180
Big Eye Chen and Tianyi

162
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,060
will follow me.

163
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,500
I'll be fine.

164
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,700
They can follow you,

165
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,580
but I can't.

166
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,060
There's no room for negotiation on this.

167
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,900
That's final.

168
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,860
Also,

169
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,140
you can tell others

170
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,100
about this,

171
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,620
but

172
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,660
you need to ensure

173
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,700
no one shows up
until I've met and talked

174
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,160
with Dian Lao'er.

175
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,100
Do you get what I mean?

176
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Alright, I promise you.

177
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,780
No one will disturb you

178
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,100
until you know his intentions.

179
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,220
But Bao...

180
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,500
- I...
- Can you man up?

181
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,100
Do you keep your word or not?

182
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,620
Hello?

183
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,480
Bao.

184
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,350
Dian Lao'er.

185
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,380
You can't trick me.

186
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,220
I'm being sincere.

187
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,620
I don't know what you're saying.

188
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,180
You're bringing a driver.

189
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,580
You're even sending scouts.

190
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,780
Aren't you trying to mess with me?

191
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,980
So what?

192
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,540
Dian Lao'er,

193
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,020
you're a madman.

194
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,500
Now you're a drowning dog.

195
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,700
You're just a mad dog.

196
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,320
Who would approach a mad dog

197
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,480
without being cautious?

198
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,180
Let's be quick if you want to meet.

199
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,100
Let's talk if you want.

200
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,060
If not, then forget it.

201
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,220
I'm very busy.

202
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,940
Well,

203
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,940
since you're here,

204
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,700
let's meet.

205
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,380
You drive

206
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,140
and put the phone on speaker.

207
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,540
I'll tell you how to go.

208
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,860
Just you alone.

209
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,180
Well.

210
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,900
Yeah, go ahead.

211
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
Put it on speaker, right?

212
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,980
Car I, Car II, follow him.

213
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,820
Car III, stay on standby.

214
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,060
Hurry up and get in!

215
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,860
Do you really think Bao's plan

216
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,700
is just a joke?

217
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,740
What do you know?

218
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,940
Bao is going to see a madman.

219
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,940
Are you sure nothing will happen?

220
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,340
Where's your phone?

221
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,300
It's in his car.

222
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
Come on, use my phone.

223
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,100
Open the location tracking.

224
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,540
Hurry up!

225
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,380
I'm telling you, Bao.

226
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,500
I'm not being petty.

227
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,820
Since you came to Binjiang,

228
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,860
I haven't had a single peaceful day.

229
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,740
I find it strange.

230
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,260
How come you managed

231
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,060
to take over Tuan Island

232
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,340
with just those few people?

233
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,540
Dian Lao'er,

234
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,220
now you want to flatter me?

235
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,340
Only you enjoy causing trouble.

236
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,980
Who wants to sleep with two hammers

237
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,780
under their pillow every night?

238
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,400
It's impossible to sleep well.

239
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,740
I swear, bro.

240
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,700
I'm not trying to cause you trouble.

241
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,020
That's just Wild Jiang...

242
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,500
But the grass

243
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,380
on his grave

244
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,700
is already growing tall.

245
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,500
Dian Lao'er,

246
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,160
what's going on with you?

247
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,300
How many circles has it been?

248
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,120
Is this a giant wheel of fortune?

249
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,540
I'm running low on gas.

250
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,940
You're almost there.

251
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,820
Turn left up ahead.

252
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,900
Turn left.

253
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,220
Do you run a phone shop?

254
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,860
You get a new number every time.

255
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,420
You're pretty cautious.

256
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,380
Mr. Xing.

257
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,020
We've been going back and forth
for almost an hour.

258
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,300
What is Dian Lao'er doing?

259
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,420
They're going back and forth
in this area.

260
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,020
He's definitely in this vicinity.

261
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,420
Keep an eye on him.

262
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,140
I'll arrange for perimeter control.

263
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,660
What are you doing here?

264
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,900
Slacking off?

265
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,620
Keep up with Bao.

266
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,780
Look at this track.

267
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,060
They're just going around in circles.

268
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,620
Since they're going in circles,

269
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
we'll wait here.

270
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,060
They'll come back sooner or later.

271
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,740
I'll take a nap.

272
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,900
You're almost there.

273
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,380
Keep going straight.

274
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,300
Keep going straight.

275
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,940
It's not safe here.

276
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,780
Go to the pier.

277
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,980
How...

278
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,620
How did you end up like this?

279
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Bao...

280
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,380
How pathetic.

281
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,700
Hurry up and go.

282
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,340
Hurry up and go.

283
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,180
Dian Lao'er.

284
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
What's going on?

285
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,760
Bao's heading for the pier.

286
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,900
Hurry and report it.

287
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Bao's heading
to Dian Lao'er's territory.

288
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,420
Hurry up!

289
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,140
The target vehicle is heading
toward Xingyu Pier.

290
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,200
The target vehicle is heading
toward Xingyu Pier.

291
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,220
Car IV, take a detour to the pier
and stand by.

292
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,180
Other cars,

293
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,520
get into position asap.

294
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,620
(Xingyu Pier)

295
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,020
Lao'er,

296
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
This...

297
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,650
Are they here to make peace?

298
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,260
Alright, Bao.

299
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,540
Hope we'll meet again.

300
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,220
Take care.

301
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,060
Alright.

302
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,400
Killing someone on the street
in broad daylight.

303
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,580
So outrageous!

304
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,360
Search the entire city.

305
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,500
Don't let any suspicious targets
slip through.

306
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,620
Find the murderer

307
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,490
if you have to dig three feet
into the ground!

308
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,380
This is what happened.

309
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,060
The gunman's aim is extremely accurate.

310
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,940
He's definitely a professional killer.

311
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,340
What did Dian Lao'er tell you?

312
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,540
He said

313
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,500
he didn't hire anyone to harm me.

314
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,940
He wanted to make peace,

315
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,100
and he asked me to spare him.

316
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,660
That's all?

317
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,820
That's all.

318
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,500
Did he have any evidence

319
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,420
to prove his innocence?

320
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,580
If he could prove his innocence,

321
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,940
why would he run?

322
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,400
Given your relationship
with Dian Lao'er,

323
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,060
if he didn't have evidence,

324
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,180
would he dare come to you?

325
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,140
Maybe...

326
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,380
He said

327
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,940
someone was after him.

328
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,020
He might have no choice.

329
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,980
After all these years,

330
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,220
he knew me well.

331
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,340
He knew I was reasonable.

332
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,860
Maybe he saw me

333
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,300
as his last hope.

334
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,940
You aren't being honest!

335
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,260
He was really good
at counter-surveillance.

336
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,180
His route and escape plan

337
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,460
were all checked out in advance.

338
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,080
The place he vanished into
is right in the urban village,

339
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,640
with only two surveillance cameras.

340
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,540
One's been broken

341
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,460
for a while.

342
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,620
The other's so outdated

343
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,020
it can't capture anything clearly.

344
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,060
Bin.

345
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,420
There must be an exit for an entrance.

346
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,860
Since he's able to disappear
at the entrance,

347
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,300
let's wait for him at the exit.

348
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,860
Where's Yong?

349
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,100
Not here yet.

350
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,500
Where's the milk tea?

351
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,780
The problem is this urban village

352
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,500
has so many small roads.

353
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,880
It's too easy for him to escape.

354
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,940
According to Locard's theory,

355
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,300
where there's a crime, there's a clue;

356
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,880
where there's action, there's a trace.

357
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,340
You said it yourself.

358
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,040
He was really good
at counter-surveillance.

359
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
If I were him,

360
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,060
I'd be hiding under everyone's nose.

361
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,140
Bin's right.

362
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,140
Some people think they're the smartest
in the world, right?

363
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,740
Get back to work.

364
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,060
Are you sure
it's my idea that's useless,

365
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,840
or is it that you're the one
who's useless?

366
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
We've checked everything,

367
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
including the sewers

368
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,860
and the septic tanks.

369
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,140
Have you checked the rat holes?

370
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,020
The killer was riding this motorcycle.

371
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,840
It'd only take half an hour
to change clothes.

372
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,420
Why would he go through all the trouble

373
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,500
to crawl through a rat hole

374
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,320
and hide in a sewer?

375
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,580
If he wanted to hide,

376
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,260
he should've hidden
the motorcycle first,

377
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,740
changed clothes, and then run.

378
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
That'd be simpler.

379
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Mr. Liu is right.

380
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,860
You're right.

381
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,420
He's old.

382
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,620
Don't hold it against him.

383
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,860
What are you mumbling about?

384
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,700
Do you think you can escape this time

385
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,880
because you've had good luck?

386
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,100
Let me tell you.

387
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,580
It's because your life

388
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,100
isn't as important as Dian Lao'er's.

389
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
Understand?

390
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,100
I know what you're thinking.

391
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,340
Bao Chenyan, you think

392
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,980
you're so impressive

393
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,280
that you can control the situation,
right?

394
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,820
Let me tell you.

395
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,620
If you keep acting like this,

396
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,240
you'll end up like Wild Jiang.

397
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,700
I'm not Wild Jiang!

398
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,540
Sit down!

399
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,460
Recently, in Binjiang,

400
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,540
one problem has arisen after another.

401
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,340
As for the culprit's intention,

402
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,260
Bao Chenyan, you've got no brain,

403
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,020
but you could figure it out
with your butt.

404
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,020
You can dig your own grave.

405
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,860
I won't stop you.

406
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,980
But is this just your own problem?

407
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,900
If you...

408
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,700
If you cause harm to innocent people,

409
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,580
I won't spare you.

410
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,110
Dian Lao'er said

411
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,400
if

412
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,340
someone wanted to kill him,

413
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,740
it'd probably be the person

414
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,500
who killed the Sun brothers.

415
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,940
Alright, got it.

416
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,020
Bao.

417
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,860
Has Xing Liang made things hard
for you again?

418
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,820
Bao,

419
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,300
how about

420
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,620
you go for a bath
to wash off the bad luck?

421
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,620
Are you crazy?

422
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,940
He didn't commit a crime.

423
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,780
He just cooperated
with the investigation.

424
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,740
Why should he be so afraid?

425
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,700
Is that being afraid?

426
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
It's being disgusted.

427
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,460
Come on.

428
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,380
Can you speak properly?

429
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,620
This is

430
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,460
the surveillance footage
from the crime scene.

431
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,220
The only clue now.

432
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,300
We can't see the killer's face,

433
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,980
but this person's outfit

434
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,460
isn't the same as the one

435
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,300
who killed Jin.

436
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,700
It's going to be hard

437
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,380
to find him.

438
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,840
The motorcycle seems
to have been modified.

439
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Modified?

440
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,300
Are you sure?

441
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,900
(Birkin Paris Club)

442
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,700
This caliper has been modified.

443
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,780
The photo is too blurry.

444
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,460
I can't tell the brand.

445
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,060
Anyway, you've got the chance.

446
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,700
You talk big but freeze

447
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,180
when something happens.

448
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,020
I'll try to see what I can find.

449
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,500
Bao.

450
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,500
Anyway, Dian Lao'er is dead now.

451
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,100
At least there won't be
so many obvious issues.

452
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,460
Those little fish and shrimp hidden away

453
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,180
won't cause any big waves.

454
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,500
Don't worry about it.

455
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,860
The people who killed Dian Lao'er

456
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,740
were too ruthless.

457
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,820
I think

458
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,300
they're also trying to threaten me.

459
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,180
Right now, we're in the open,

460
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,160
and they're in the dark.

461
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,160
We need to have a plan asap.

462
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,640
Have you thought of a way?

463
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,060
No,

464
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,300
but I think you should investigate

465
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,140
whatever you can.

466
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,680
As for the other matters,

467
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,900
leave them to me.

468
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,340
Any new leads

469
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,100
about Qi Hanchen?

470
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,940
Here's his file.

471
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,940
Qi Hanchen's family is in business.

472
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,240
His background is complicated.

473
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,640
He's well-connected
in both political and business circles,

474
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,300
but one thing is very strange.

475
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,300
He only holds honorary positions

476
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,140
in many companies

477
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,300
and receives consulting fees.

478
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,780
Under his name,

479
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,540
there are no shares in any companies.

480
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,180
(Qi Hanchen, An Zhihui)

481
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,020
Look.

482
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,500
He's an expert.

483
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,380
He's built himself

484
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,780
a firewall.

485
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,820
It's not easy to find his flaws.

486
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,180
(Qi Hanchen, An Zhihui)
Keep an eye on him.

487
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,820
The immediate priority

488
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,980
is to find that motorcycle killer.

489
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,580
But it's strange.

490
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,740
Dian Lao'er was so careful.

491
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,180
He even managed to shake us off.

492
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,500
How did this killer

493
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,300
get the exact location?

494
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,860
Mr. Xing.

495
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,060
Mr. Yang.

496
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,620
Mr. Xing, look.

497
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,170
When I reviewed it,

498
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,340
I found this app.

499
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,860
This app

500
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,540
provides parental location services.

501
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,420
I'm wondering

502
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,060
whether this app

503
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,220
leaked the location

504
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,640
and brought the killer there.

505
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
The man over there
is Chen Mingyuan's father.

506
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,580
Does he usually like to be alone?

507
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,140
The old man has some dementia.

508
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,690
He doesn't interact much with others.

509
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,140
Hello, sir.

510
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,740
(Location: Son)

511
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,700
It's fine.

512
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,380
The old man can't let go of his phone.

513
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
He says he can see

514
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,660
where his son is on it.

515
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,260
He even sleeps with it.

516
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,420
Has anyone visited him

517
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,540
in the last few days?

518
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,900
No.

519
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
Was there any stranger who came by

520
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,100
or any unexpected events?

521
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,900
No.

522
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
We have to register
whoever enters or leaves.

523
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,300
I checked this

524
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,180
for the entire afternoon.

525
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,020
Anyway,

526
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,180
it must be Brembo or Frando

527
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,780
based on the English name.

528
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,100
Could you speak a bit slower?

529
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,420
What Brembo or Frando?

530
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,520
You won't understand
even if I explain it.

531
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,500
These aren't important.

532
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,700
You just need to know

533
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,580
this isn't cheap.

534
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,720
Are you saying

535
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,340
not many people can afford this?

536
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,900
You've got smarter.

537
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,380
Just follow this lead and investigate.

538
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,440
Is there anything to eat?

539
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,300
These are the records
of some volunteers.

540
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,220
(Visitor Registration Form)

541
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,660
Did you register everyone?

542
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,780
There were 14 volunteers.

543
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,660
It was a bit messy.

544
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,140
So we only registered the leaders.

545
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,340
(Facial Recognition System)
How long did they stay?

546
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,740
They stayed until about 3:30.

547
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,700
When they left,

548
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,740
there were 12 volunteers.

549
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,000
I've checked the records.

550
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,280
There's nothing wrong.

551
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,540
Ms. Wu,

552
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,380
didn't you say there were 14 people?

553
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,740
Yes.

554
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,840
I was going to serve them tea,

555
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,730
so I counted carefully.

556
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,540
It should be accurate.

557
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,340
Did anyone leave in between?

558
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,220
I didn't notice that.

559
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,180
When we came back at noon,

560
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,380
we seemed to see two men

561
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,320
coming out of the yard.

562
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,430
What time was that?

563
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,780
It was around 1:30.

564
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,060
Do you remember
what those two men looked like?

565
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,660
They were wearing hats

566
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,700
and had their heads down.

567
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,780
I was far away,

568
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,700
so I couldn't see clearly.

569
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,340
Right, there were quite a few volunteers

570
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,420
taking photos at the time.

571
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,100
Maybe someone took a picture.

572
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,100
Okay.

573
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,820
I'm here.

574
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,340
Thanks, Bao,

575
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,320
for driving me here.

576
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,580
Lao'er,

577
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,820
you can't keep hiding

578
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,140
like this.

579
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,540
Don't worry about me.

580
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm a worthless man, despised by heaven.

581
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,060
Fine.

582
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,580
In case something happens,

583
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,740
don't forget

584
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,780
to find Hai

585
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,300
for a souvenir.

586
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,700
Liu.

587
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,980
No rush.

588
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,180
You go ahead.

589
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,700
I can't sleep

590
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,020
with all these thoughts.

591
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,140
Let's go.

592
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,500
Mr. Xing.

593
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,660
Yu and I have contacted the volunteers

594
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,260
and told them to send us

595
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,940
the photos and videos

596
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,700
they took that day asap.

597
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,820
According to them,

598
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,820
during the event,

599
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,700
one staff member

600
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,660
anonymously received a donation

601
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,620
and asked them to bring

602
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,900
more volunteers over.

603
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,580
They were also told that the items

604
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,120
had to be delivered before 12:00 noon

605
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,100
and to keep

606
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,620
the elderly active for at least an hour.

607
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,580
I think there's something off
about this.

608
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,060
They were probably targeting
Dian Lao'er's father.

609
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,600
Dian Lao'er has been

610
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,140
pretending to have a bad relationship

611
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,420
with his father all these years

612
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,700
so that his enemies

613
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,980
wouldn't go after his father.

614
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,460
Now, to the outside world,

615
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,820
Dian Lao'er seemed to not care
about his father at all.

616
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,300
But this person went

617
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,980
to the nursing home for clues.

618
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,620
I think

619
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,300
he must know Dian Lao'er well.

620
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,700
(Qi Hanchen, An Zhihui)

621
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,820
Boss.

622
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,580
Hui's family is all set.

623
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,860
He'll take the fall.

624
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,020
There

625
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,280
should be no problem
with this from now on.

626
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,860
Who shot Dian Lao'er?

627
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,940
I just had someone

628
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,100
check his location

629
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,220
but didn't hire a shooter.

630
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,060
Whoever did it,

631
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,900
Dian Lao'er's death
has its pros and cons.

632
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,900
Sort through all the clues
related to him

633
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,280
and cut off the connections asap.

634
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,420
We can't let anyone

635
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,300
smear us and profit from this

636
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,260
behind our backs.

637
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,540
OK.

638
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,980
(Surveillance; Sunset Nursing Home)

639
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,420
What's this?

640
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,100
These are

641
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,570
some photos taken by the volunteers
at the scene.

642
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,290
Play them for me.

643
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,320
Slower, slower.

644
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,980
Good. Keep going.

645
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
Last one. Last one.

646
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,620
Can you zoom in a bit?

647
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,700
Are there any other photos?

648
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,780
No more.

649
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,500
This is too blurry.

650
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,620
Can you make it clearer?

651
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,300
I'll give it a try.

652
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,580
Tian.

653
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,980
All the modification records

654
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,200
for this car are here.

655
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,580
(Motor Vehicle Inspection Record)

656
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,380
Yes, it's this one.

657
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,220
(Note: Caliper, Brembo)
Almost identical to our target.

658
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,660
Can you find this motorcycle?

659
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,860
This one...

660
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,460
This was a few months ago.

661
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,540
I remember.

662
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,060
It was Yiwei's boss, Hu,

663
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,580
who brought it over.

664
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,820
Yiwei?

665
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,020
Wait.

666
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,540
Why did they ask you to modify it?

667
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,220
Aren't they quite capable themselves?

668
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,460
He told me

669
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,680
that his shop was short
of Brembo front calipers,

670
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,000
and the client was in a hurry.

671
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,340
Tian, you know I'm quite capable too,

672
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,120
so it makes sense for him to come to me.

673
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,260
But hearing you guys talk just now,

674
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,780
it does seem a bit strange.

675
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,220
What do you mean?

676
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,960
Based on these facial features,

677
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,860
do a similar search.

678
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,460
We must figure out who these two are.

679
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,700
Alright.

680
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,420
Dian Lao'er asked me to give you this.

681
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,580
All shares

682
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,460
of Benniu Trading Co., Ltd.

683
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,060
are transferred

684
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,500
to Bao Chenyan.

685
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,020
Did he have any else to say?

686
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,940
Come on, bro.

687
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,660
I'm leaving this

688
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
(Xingyu Haiyu)

689
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,420
to you.

690
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,540
Do you trust me so much?

691
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,540
It's not about trust.

692
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,140
I've been around for half my life.

693
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,900
I've schemed against others

694
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,220
and been schemed against myself.

695
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,300
Everything I do

696
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,100
has a purpose.

697
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,260
But the problem is

698
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,720
I never raised someone

699
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,190
close to me.

700
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,460
So, I can only

701
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,540
leave this to you.

702
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,700
May I ask you something?

703
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,820
When I was

704
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,740
crippled,

705
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,980
I was useless.

706
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,300
Everyone avoided me.

707
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,420
But you gave me a meal.

708
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,500
That's not like you.

709
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,020
Let me tell you.

710
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,260
This shows we have fate.

711
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,780
We're each other's benefactors.

712
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,580
Why would I come to find you

713
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,100
when I was down then?

714
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,860
Is there really no other way
to solve this?

715
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,940
Things are different now.

716
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,860
Violence can solve everything.

717
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,700
I don't want to resort to violence.

718
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,220
I've been hiding here.

719
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,260
Let me tell you.

720
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,580
This time,

721
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,460
if I can escape,

722
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,580
it'll be my luck.

723
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,420
If I can't,

724
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,620
I'll die.

725
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,700
But I can't ignore my dad.

726
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,700
Though he's over 70 years old

727
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,860
and won't live much longer,

728
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,940
I still can't let him die with me.

729
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,460
I've thought about it.

730
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,460
Only Bao

731
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,740
can help me,

732
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,260
and he's loyal.

733
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,300
He'll take care of things.

734
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,060
Do you understand?

735
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,660
Dian Lao'er's last request

736
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,620
was for you to take care of his father,

737
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,340
who has dementia,

738
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,300
after you get the money.

739
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,420
He said that in the Tuan Island project,

740
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,050
only you could stand up to Qi Hanchen.

741
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,980
He's betting one last time.

742
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,900
