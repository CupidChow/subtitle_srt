1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,040
Join the army?

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,300
(Five years ago)
Yes, it's been approved.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,140
I'll leave in two days.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,100
What?

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,980
You're still in college.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,860
Why did you...?

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,780
More importantly,

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,700
why didn't you discuss it with me?

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm discussing it with you now.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,300
It's not a discussion

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,100
but an announcement.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,620
Sister,

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,180
you tried so hard to get into
your dream university,

14
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,220
and you'll go abroad.

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,780
Isn't that your plan? You...

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,220
Why would you do this?

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,540
Dream

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,500
is too hard to reach.

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,260
For me,

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,900
something else is more important.

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,060
What?

22
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,340
Stop talking nonsense.

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,420
This

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,980
can't be an impulse.

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,020
Who put this idea in your head?

26
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,900
Uncle Jiang?

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,580
He told me something important,

28
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,100
which reminded me of my past.

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,940
Maybe I can only make it

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,580
by joining the army.

31
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,260
What's so important

32
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,260
that you want to give up

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,460
everything you've striven for?

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,100
It's about my father.

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,540
Have you found any clues?

36
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,420
I haven't found anything

37
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,620
over the past few years,

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,420
so I have to try my best

39
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,580
to find out the truth.

40
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,900
Sister,

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,700
he...

42
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,580
Why would

43
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,860
Uncle Jiang bring this up

44
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,060
at this point?

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,060
Uncle Jiang has helped us a lot,

46
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,980
but he's a cunning man.

47
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
He's up to no good.

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,820
Tianyi,

49
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,140
I've never said

50
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,660
anything harsh to you,

51
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,500
right?

52
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,060
But today,

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,860
I have to remind you

54
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,380
he's our benefactor.

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,340
You can't slander him
in front of anyone.

56
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,100
I'm not slandering him.

57
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,100
I just...

58
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,300
I just don't understand.

59
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,940
I have to reach my goal,

60
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,180
whatever it takes.

61
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,980
=Black&White Forest=

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,980
=Episode 22=

63
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,900
Well.

64
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,700
How dare you hang up?

65
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,140
Why don't you just block me?

66
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,220
That's even better.

67
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,060
No. I...

68
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,820
I was in a hurry

69
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,340
and my hand slipped.

70
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,860
I called you

71
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,180
so many times

72
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,540
and sent you so many messages.

73
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,140
Did your hand slip?

74
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,300
If you want to lie,

75
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,820
at least find a smart excuse.

76
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,740
Is it about the case?

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,420
Stop asking.

78
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,780
You have to

79
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,660
tell me the truth,

80
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,900
or it's over.

81
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,780
Fine.

82
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,460
I'll post it on Moments.

83
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,420
I'll tell everyone

84
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,140
we're not friends anymore.

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,380
Bin, stop.

86
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,620
Chen Yiming killed himself.

87
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,180
Dead?

88
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,620
No,

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,460
we saved him,

90
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,220
but the hospital said

91
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,620
he's dangerous.

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,580
We don't know

93
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,660
if he can survive.

94
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,060
I knew it.

95
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,020
When we were having dinner,

96
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,700
Xing Liang took a call and left.

97
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,860
I knew something happened.

98
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,820
Chen Yiming.

99
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,620
Why would Chen Yiming

100
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,500
try to end his life?

101
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,780
Did you do what I told you?

102
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,780
No.

103
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,980
It's not your fault.

104
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,700
I made a mistake.

105
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,690
Did they punish you?

106
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,260
I'll talk to Xing Liang.

107
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Bin.

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,460
I've told you it's not your fault.

109
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,700
It's my fault.

110
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,780
I made a mistake.

111
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,460
If you're

112
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,820
really guilty,

113
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,980
promise me one thing.

114
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,980
Okay.

115
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,980
I promise.

116
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,300
As long as I can...

117
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,140
Even if I can't,

118
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,860
I'll try my best to do it.

119
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,100
Fine.

120
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,940
As you know, the case

121
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,020
is very important,

122
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,020
and Mr. Xing has said

123
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,580
outsiders can get involved in this.

124
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
However,

125
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,300
you're my brother.

126
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,420
I can't turn you down.

127
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,460
So, please don't ask me

128
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,460
about the case,

129
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,300
okay?

130
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm busy.

131
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,980
Goodbye.

132
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,060
- Bin.
- Stop.

133
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,500
Bin!

134
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,860
Is that a yes or no?

135
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,140
Just take the money.

136
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,740
If anything happens

137
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,660
to Uncle Liu, just tell me, okay?

138
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,300
We'll deal with it together.

139
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,740
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

140
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,820
Nothing.

141
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,980
What?

142
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,260
Uncle Liu fell ill,

143
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,380
and Hui wanted to borrow
some money from Man,

144
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,940
but Man wouldn't lend him a penny.

145
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,220
If Bao was here,

146
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,580
he wouldn't let this happen.

147
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,940
Didn't I tell you

148
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,460
that old man is a rascal?

149
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,940
He looks like a nice person,

150
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,700
but he has an evil heart.

151
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,500
Well,

152
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,140
ask our brothers to raise

153
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,220
some money for him.

154
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,100
We've transferred the money to him.

155
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,140
However, think about it.

156
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,500
How much

157
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,860
will it cost?

158
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,940
At least we should

159
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,500
try our best.

160
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,660
Fine.

161
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,420
Listen, calm down.

162
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,500
Bao is not here.

163
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,820
Don't make trouble.

164
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,740
Why would I do that?

165
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,340
I'll ask him for money.

166
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,580
We've all donated our money.

167
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,780
How could he

168
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,060
reject you?

169
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,540
Tu Manjiang.

170
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,340
Add some brown sugar.

171
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,740
I've told you

172
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,540
Bao isn't here.

173
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,980
Yes.

174
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,460
Wait a minute.

175
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,660
Bao is not here.

176
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,660
It's not up to me.

177
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,620
Fine.

178
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm coming.

179
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,780
Okay.

180
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,940
See you later.

181
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,220
I've told you

182
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,300
we need to be careful with him.

183
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,180
He sneaked out to see someone.

184
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,380
It can't be good.

185
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,500
It's too early to say this.

186
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,140
You'll eat your words.

187
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,940
I'm so curious.

188
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,860
What did Uncle Man do?

189
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,980
Why do you hate him so much?

190
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,580
He's too pretentious. I don't like it.

191
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,620
He's always

192
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,020
showing off his knowledge and talent.

193
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,540
Listen, you're too naive.

194
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,820
Why can't you realize he's a pretentious

195
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,700
hypocrite?

196
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Fine.

197
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,940
You have sharp eyes.

198
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,500
I can't wait to see

199
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,500
how you'll reveal his true colors.

200
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,740
I'm serious.

201
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,540
Think about it.

202
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,500
Now that Bao isn't at the company,

203
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,140
he's the one in charge.

204
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,180
If he really betrays Bao,

205
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,940
it'll be a disaster.

206
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,380
Hello.

207
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,340
(Guanhai Tea House)

208
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,820
Hello, do you have our membership?

209
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,380
Member?

210
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,020
Well,

211
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,420
we have an appointment.

212
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,350
He's on the way, and we'll wait for him.

213
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,900
What's his name?

214
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,030
Well,

215
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,460
he's Mr. Wang.

216
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,580
Mr. Wang?

217
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,500
We don't have a member
called Mr. Wang.

218
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,500
How's that possible?

219
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,460
Look it up.

220
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,300
I told you he's not reliable,

221
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,140
haven't I?

222
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,660
He didn't believe it.

223
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,460
Tell your boss we're here.

224
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,310
My boss?

225
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,700
Do you mean Mr. An?

226
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,620
Yes.

227
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,860
He invited us

228
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,420
to his wine party last time.

229
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,540
Just call him.

230
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,220
Mr. An told us

231
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,060
not to serve anyone who claims

232
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,020
to be his friend.

233
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,700
We know your boss.

234
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,180
Please call him.

235
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,660
Sorry. That's the rule.

236
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,870
You'll never have a full meal.

237
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,660
I just want to take a look.

238
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,180
- Hello.
- I'll join your membership.

239
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,500
- It's the same.
- Sorry. That's the rule.

240
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm coming.

241
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,540
Don't let them escape.

242
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,300
What's wrong?

243
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
It's Tuan Island!

244
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,540
Come on. Hit me!

245
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,660
You'll go to jail!

246
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,820
Who started it?

247
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,740
They started it!

248
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,820
Ping's son was injured!

249
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,100
Mouse Zhou, who the hell are you?

250
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,260
How dare you make a scene?

251
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,740
Did you forget how you begged Bao

252
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,940
to spare your life?

253
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Luo Tianyi.

254
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,380
Bao is over.

255
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,900
How dare you be so arrogant?

256
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,940
Without Bao,

257
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,820
do you think a bunch of losers

258
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,550
can keep Tuan Island?

259
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,900
Know your place.

260
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,460
If I'm satisfied,

261
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,540
maybe I'll offer you a job.

262
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,620
How dare you say that?

263
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,140
Listen,

264
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,580
you have more people.

265
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,340
Otherwise, I'll tear your mouth!

266
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,140
Bao is accused of murder.

267
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Even if he can survive,

268
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,180
he'll spend

269
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,580
the rest of his life in jail.

270
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,300
Do you think

271
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,060
he can have your back?

272
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,500
Tianyi.

273
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,580
Stop.

274
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,500
Mouse,

275
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,740
I suggest you

276
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,860
know your place.

277
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,780
You don't deserve
to get Bao's attention.

278
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,260
Listen,

279
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,540
if you come here again,

280
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,180
I'll break your legs.

281
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,980
- Understand?
- Yes.

282
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,940
Get lost!

283
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,140
Stop looking!

284
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,620
Get lost!

285
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,220
Get lost!

286
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,820
Well, was Mouse Zhou

287
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,620
telling the truth?

288
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,980
Will Bao come back?

289
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,980
Nonsense.

290
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,620
If Bao can't come back,

291
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,860
they'll make trouble every day.

292
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,640
Our business will be ruined!

293
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,260
After this fight,

294
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,540
no customers will come.

295
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,500
We should close our stores.

296
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,610
What happened?

297
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,980
We had a fight with

298
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
some troublemakers.

299
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,620
I've told you

300
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,100
this is a critical time,

301
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,180
and you need to stay calm.

302
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,550
Stay calm?

303
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,980
Answer me. How can we stay calm?

304
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,980
They'll only hit us harder

305
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,620
if we hold back. Do we have a choice?

306
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,660
Listen,

307
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,780
if they cause trouble again,

308
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,620
I'll take care of them for good!

309
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,740
Luo Tianyi.

310
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,300
Can you think twice

311
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,900
before taking action?

312
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
You're so reckless.

313
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,180
You'll get us into big trouble!

314
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,780
How are you going to explain it to Bao?

315
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,300
If I don't help the neighbors
in trouble,

316
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,260
how can I face Bao?

317
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,940
Fine. Whatever.

318
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,100
I can't stop you.

319
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,620
Anyway, I've warned you.

320
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,980
Don't act like we're bullying you.

321
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,500
Fine, let me ask you a question.

322
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,540
Where were you

323
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,070
when they were in trouble?

324
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,300
I...

325
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,860
I went to the bank to meet a client.

326
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
What a coincidence.

327
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,980
You left right before they came.

328
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,100
Tianyi!

329
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,460
Shut up.

330
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,940
At this point,

331
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,340
we should stick together
and deal with our enemy.

332
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,260
Stop arguing with our people.

333
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,780
They'll laugh at us.

334
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,060
Tianyi was just

335
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,300
too angry.

336
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,660
Please don't blame him.

337
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,780
Tianyi,

338
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,860
apologize to Uncle Man.

339
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,700
Don't be angry.

340
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,820
(Tang Zheng Hotel Supplies)

341
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,060
Look at you.

342
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,260
You really

343
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,140
pissed Uncle Man off.

344
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,180
Still angry?

345
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,820
Fine.

346
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
You can yell at me as you want.

347
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,940
Hey, bro,

348
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,260
which side are you on?

349
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,660
Why did you ask me to apologize?

350
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,860
He's an indifferent bystander.

351
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,900
Why did you help him?

352
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,140
I was helping you.

353
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,220
If Uncle Man leaves,

354
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,620
who will deal with

355
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,460
this mess?

356
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,860
Can you?

357
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,900
I know you don't like Uncle Man,

358
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,700
but you have to admit

359
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,500
he's really capable.

360
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,740
Bao is in detention.

361
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,140
If Uncle Man quits his job and leaves,

362
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,900
it'll be a disaster.

363
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,020
We don't know if he's innocent.

364
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,820
Why did you believe he went to the bank?

365
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,380
You don't have evidence,

366
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,660
so don't tell others about it.

367
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,820
Many people are watching us

368
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,780
right now.

369
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,780
They want us
to fight against each other.

370
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,900
Why are they

371
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,260
closing their stores now?

372
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,380
They usually go home at night.

373
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,580
Business has been bad,

374
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,780
and Mouse Zhou smashed the market.

375
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,420
Who dares to come?

376
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,860
We can

377
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,020
think of this

378
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,980
as an opportunity
to replace the old stuff.

379
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,460
And maybe they'll attract new customers.

380
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,060
Huh.

381
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,780
Do you think they're as rich as you?

382
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,700
They're making a living here

383
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,460
because they don't have money.

384
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,420
They can only afford
to repair the broken things.

385
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,020
I'm not asking them to pay for it.

386
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,740
I'll pay, okay?

387
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,500
How much do you have?

388
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,900
What do you want?

389
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,820
This one.

390
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,860
I know it's wrong.

391
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,740
I'm doing this for my kid!

392
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,620
Besides, I only want to sell my stuff.

393
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,700
Am I wrong?

394
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,220
I didn't say that.

395
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,260
Fine. You don't want to be the bad guy.

396
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,780
I'll do it!

397
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,580
Where are you going?

398
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm going out!

399
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,460
You...

400
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,900
Where are you going?

401
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Ping?

402
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,500
You live next door to Hui?

403
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,620
(Share Transfer Agreement)

404
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,300
We're neighbors.

405
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,240
Yes.

406
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,380
Qi Hanchen is so cunning.

407
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,420
He's trying to steal our shares.

408
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,260
Luckily, we discovered it early.

409
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,940
Only Auntie Chen signed the deal.

410
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,020
The other vendors haven't decided.

411
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,020
Since Bao was arrested,

412
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,940
everyone has been anxious.

413
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,780
Besides, they've been

414
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,740
making a scene

415
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,900
and spreading bad rumors about Bao.

416
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,140
They're offering the best price

417
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,940
to reassure people

418
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
and using preferential ranks

419
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,180
to arouse their eagerness.

420
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,580
It's brilliant.

421
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,820
He's playing dirty.

422
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,780
How can you defend him?

423
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,380
I'm just being objective.

424
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,060
The priority

425
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,820
is to figure out how to deal with it.

426
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,860
We can't let them

427
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,580
acquire the vendors' shares.

428
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,820
I've sent people

429
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,780
to keep an eye on them.

430
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,860
If they sell their shares...

431
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,060
Do you want to go to jail too?

432
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,420
We can gain their sympathy,

433
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,060
but they own the shares.

434
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,780
They have the right

435
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,900
to decide what's best for them.

436
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,140
Man,

437
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,460
what's your opinion?

438
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,060
I think the best solution right now

439
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,620
is to cooperate with Qi Hanchen.

440
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,900
What? What's wrong with you?

441
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,860
They didn't want

442
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,340
to sell their shares

443
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,660
because Bao was here.

444
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,340
He'll be detained for a while.

445
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,500
The more unsettled the vendors are,

446
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,860
the more shares

447
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,900
will be sold.

448
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,660
If Qi Hanchen

449
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,700
gets all their shares,

450
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,420
it'll be a big threat

451
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,460
for us.

452
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,620
Arrange a meeting with him.

453
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,660
Ms. Wen,

454
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,420
maybe we should think it through.

455
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,180
Bao's bottom line
is to keep Tuan Island.

456
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,660
We have to talk to him in person.

457
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,820
I want to see

458
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,260
how greedy he is.

459
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,940
Xing, I'm impressed.

460
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,060
A major suspect

461
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,420
nearly killed himself

462
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,100
under your watch.

463
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,220
What the hell have you done?

464
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,980
It's my fault.

465
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,900
I can accept any punishment

466
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,860
except for suspension.

467
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,580
I must solve the case.

468
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,350
Listen, you're so lucky.

469
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,740
He's still alive.

470
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,340
We'll

471
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,270
accept the advice your team submitted.

472
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,630
In addition,

473
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,340
I went to

474
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,300
the Provincial Department.

475
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,700
The leader said

476
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,930
according to the current statement

477
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,230
and relevant evidence,

478
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,260
the gun case

479
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,540
should be closed.

480
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,340
There's still so much doubt.

481
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,300
Closed?

482
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,420
Are you kidding me?

483
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,420
Calm down.

484
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,020
Do you know how many people

485
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,900
are on this case?

486
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't you know

487
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,660
how stressed I am?

488
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,070
Besides,

489
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm not asking you to stop.

490
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,620
The case is closed,

491
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,410
but there won't be
an awards ceremony for now.

492
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,420
The task force will continue
to investigate it.

493
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,140
Are you happy now?

494
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,620
Why should I be happy?

495
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,900
We deserve it.

496
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,100
Don't get carried away.

497
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,540
I've tried my best to get what you need,

498
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,020
but you must promise me,

499
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,540
if you want to solve the case,

500
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,780
don't go too far,

501
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,020
okay?

502
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,210
Last time, you nearly

503
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,100
ended up in prison.

504
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,620
Don't let it happen again.

505
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,300
Got it.

506
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
It won't happen again.

507
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,690
Xing.

508
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,100
You know what you're doing,

509
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,300
and I won't stop you.

510
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,980
However,

511
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,580
at this point,

512
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,420
if you really

513
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,980
want to dig into it,

514
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,940
it won't

515
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
just be a criminal case.

516
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,580
I believe you know

517
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,200
what's behind the case.

518
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,420
Xuan,

519
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,700
it was my father

520
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,140
and Uncle Wen's favorite wine.

521
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,500
They'd

522
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,980
have a drink

523
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,780
with some small dishes

524
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,260
from time to time.

525
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,740
They could talk all night.

526
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,780
I still don't know

527
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,260
why they had so much to talk about.

528
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,980
Do you know?

529
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,140
There was a time

530
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,780
when my mother had a problem

531
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,740
with Uncle Wen

532
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,780
because of this.

533
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,940
You were right about it.

534
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
I remember my mother and Auntie Wu

535
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,710
could also talk all night.

536
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,100
Back then, I also had a good time

537
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,140
because I overheard many gossips.

538
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,420
Really?

539
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,260
Xuan.

540
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,500
You talked about our past last time.

541
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,220
I've been thinking about it.

542
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,020
Our friendship

543
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,580
is very precious.

544
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,220
You can never have enough money.

545
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,020
If we become enemies

546
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,580
because of money,

547
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,580
it'll be so not worth it.

548
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,340
Well,

549
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,580
let's forget about

550
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,700
what happened.

551
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Here's to you.

552
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,740
I apologize

553
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,500
for what I did.

554
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,260
You don't have to do this.

555
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,120
Our families are old friends.

556
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,580
I won't hold a grudge against you.

557
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,300
That'd be great.

558
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,940
To express my gratitude,

559
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,940
I've prepared a gift.

560
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,460
(MorningStar Investment, MOU)

561
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,020
Then I'll

562
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,420
take this.

563
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,480
Come on.

564
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,340
Here's to you.

565
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,300
Drinking together

566
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,620
is much more interesting

567
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
than drinking alone.

568
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,740
We're partners now.

569
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,820
We'll have many opportunities

570
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,300
to drink together.

571
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,380
Yes.

572
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
When

573
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,340
Bao is free,

574
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,700
I believe

575
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,500
we'll have more time

576
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,460
to drink together.

577
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,340
That's right.

578
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,660
I was too impatient.

579
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,220
We'll

580
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,100
save this wine.

581
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,940
When Bao is released,

582
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,340
we'll drink it for the celebration.

583
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,940
Xuan, don't worry.

584
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,060
I won't let you wait for too long.

585
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,460
(Binjiang Detention Center)

586
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,660
(Relevant)
What took him so long?

587
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,580
(Personnel Only)

588
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,420
Don't worry.

589
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,900
It's about time.

590
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,180
The police said they lacked evidence.

591
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,140
As long as there's no new evidence,

592
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,420
Bao will be alright.

593
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,500
Don't do this.

594
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,180
Bao,

595
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,460
eat tofu.

596
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,780
I told you

597
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,940
I wanted cooked tofu.

598
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,500
Then forget it.

599
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,440
Hello.

600
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,860
Let's wash off bad luck.

601
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,020
Okay.

602
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,780
Maybe next time.

603
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,860
We'll have a meal

604
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,580
at Banshantang tonight.

605
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,180
We need to talk.

606
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,780
Get in.

607
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,060
Binbin!

608
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,300
Come here.

609
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,300
I'm really fine.

610
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,780
Get in.

611
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,980
(Binjiang Detention Center)

612
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,400
Yes.

613
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,020
Yes.

614
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,220
That's right.

615
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,940
(Director's Office)

616
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,220
Okay.

617
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,260
Okay.

618
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,940
When I go back to Yang City,

619
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,540
I'll definitely visit you,

620
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,780
okay?

621
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,620
Okay.

622
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,280
No problem.

623
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,020
Mr. Li?

624
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,060
Yes.

625
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,340
As you said,

626
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,620
I should report

627
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,380
Bao Chenyan's bail.

628
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,860
- Did he leave?
- Yes.

629
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,420
Listen,

630
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,560
we're doing this to lure the enemy.

631
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,910
Don't screw up.

632
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,700
No matter what,

633
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,080
this is the most feasible plan

634
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,340
we have.

635
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,840
Well, look,

636
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,220
Chen Yiming

637
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,330
is in a coma.

638
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,700
He can't make another statement,

639
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,700
so the case can get

640
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,780
any progress.

641
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,420
What's the point of locking Bao up?

642
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,660
He eats too much.

643
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,500
I released him

644
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,540
and sent an eye.

645
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,980
Tuan Island is a bait.

646
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,940
Maybe Bao Chenyan

647
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,180
is not the mastermind,

648
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,380
but he definitely plays
an important role.

649
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,780
Only in this way

650
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,820
can we find something new.

651
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,660
Come on.

652
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,820
I'll finish this.

653
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,460
Bao, I'm so impressed.

654
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,300
It seems I need

655
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,460
to practice drinking.

656
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,700
Otherwise, you'll think

657
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,140
I'm a bad drinker.

658
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,140
How's that possible?

659
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,580
Mr. Qi,

660
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,940
I've heard

661
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,980
you're interested in Tuan Island.

662
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,620
Welcome.

663
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,980
We can

664
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,140
make money together.

665
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,050
No problem.

666
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,120
We'll be

667
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,300
partners soon,

668
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,710
so I want to make it clear

669
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,850
right now.

670
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,500
Of course.

671
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,670
Tell me what you need.

672
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,480
First,

673
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,740
don't raise

674
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,900
the stall rent.

675
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,780
Second,

676
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,460
all matters concerning their interests

677
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,260
must be approved by them.

678
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,300
Are you kidding me?

679
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,030
Ms. Wen,

680
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,300
I think

681
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,540
I've been very cooperative.

682
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,500
However, it seems

683
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,660
you don't want to cooperate with me.

684
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,620
Mr. Qi, it has nothing to do with her,

685
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,020
and it's

686
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,140
not just you.

687
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,340
If anyone

688
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,780
wants to

689
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,460
cooperate with us,

690
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,820
they have to accept it.

691
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,340
Ms. Wen,

692
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,620
don't you think

693
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,980
you're way out of line?

694
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,340
It has nothing...

695
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,380
You got us wrong.

696
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,580
We really want

697
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,990
to cooperate

698
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,300
with you.

699
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,140
I'm so sorry we can't

700
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,420
reach a consensus.

701
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,900
Fine.

702
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,660
I'm afraid I have to miss the wine.

703
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,700
Bao.

704
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,060
Just a heads-up.

705
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,820
It takes time

706
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,100
to savor the wine.

707
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,580
You drink too fast.

708
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,180
It's bad for your health.

709
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,300
See?

710
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,140
He was threatening me.

711
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,700
Bao.

712
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
We can't underestimate him.

713
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,580
Stop worrying about it.

714
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,740
One step at a time.

715
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,900
Besides, no one knows

716
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,420
what will happen.

717
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,980
You're right.

718
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,740
See? Zixuan

719
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,220
is so brave and calm.

720
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,100
Look at you.

721
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,300
In my opinion,

722
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,420
we're all common people.

723
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,260
We're human.

724
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,580
We're just flesh and blood.

725
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,540
I'm so scared.

726
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,820
Flesh and blood?

727
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,460
Are you a boxer?

728
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,780
When it comes to wisdom,
you might lose the game.

729
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,580
It's okay.

730
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,820
I have Man

731
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,740
and the Lin Family.

732
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,700
Come in.

733
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,300
Where's Mr. Lin?

734
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,900
He's having an online meeting.

735
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,260
Please have a seat.

736
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,260
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

737
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,100
- Okay.
- Thanks.

738
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,140
Mr. Lin.

739
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,300
Sheng.

740
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,740
It's been a long time.

741
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,620
It's been a long time.

742
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,460
Let me introduce her.

743
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,820
This is Ms. Wen.

744
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,060
This is Mr. Bao.

745
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,020
Mr. Lin, nice to meet you.

746
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,500
Sorry to keep you waiting. Have a seat.

747
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,660
Hello, Mr. Lin.

748
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,500
Hello.

749
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,900
Come on. Have a seat.

750
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,220
I heard

751
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,700
you flew here

752
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,020
to do us

753
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,940
a favor.

754
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,460
We really

755
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,220
appreciate it.

756
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,940
No matter what,

757
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,740
I have to host a meal

758
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,020
for you.

759
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,260
Mr. Tu

760
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,100
is always smart.

761
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,900
I'm sure

762
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,420
it's a good project.

763
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,340
Thank you for your trust.

764
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,830
As for the project,

765
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,260
if you need anything,

766
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,100
just tell us,

767
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,540
we'll try our best.

768
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,180
I've read

769
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,300
the project plan.

770
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,740
No further questions.

771
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,140
I can sign it now.

772
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,940
Wow, that's great.

773
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Thank you so much.

774
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,100
Thanks.

775
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Mr. Lin,

776
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,140
thank you

777
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,700
for your trust.

778
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,380
I've had faith in you.

779
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,340
Bao,

780
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,620
you made a name for yourself

781
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,740
in Binjiang.

782
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,780
Enough.

783
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,620
Don't bring it up.

784
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,220
Ms. Wen,

785
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,620
you're a successful woman.

786
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,700
Wen Group is so lucky

787
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,860
to have you.

788
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,220
I'm so flattered.

789
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,180
Well,

790
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,860
this is a big favor.

791
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,340
We're friends now.

792
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,740
However,

793
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
something is missing.

794
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,580
No matter what,

795
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,860
we have to

796
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,420
have a meal

797
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
and drink together.

798
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,540
I'll skip the meal.

799
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,620
I need to go back to Gang City

800
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,020
for an important meeting.

801
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,620
Maybe next time.

802
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,740
Well,

803
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,980
we didn't prepare for this.

804
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,260
Mr. Lin, you can go back to work.

805
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,300
As for the contract,

806
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,220
we can

807
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,500
discuss it with your secretary.

808
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,500
See you next time.

809
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,140
When you come,

810
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,620
please have a drink with us.

811
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,620
- Okay.
- Zixuan,

812
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,540
why should we wait?

813
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,780
I think

814
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,980
today

815
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,860
is perfect.

816
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,980
I'll help you reschedule your flight,

817
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,320
- okay?
- We're partners now.

818
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,740
There'll be many opportunities.

819
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,660
- Next time?
- Okay.

820
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,740
- Next time.
- Next time.

821
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
- Next time.
- Okay.

822
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,740
- Next time.
- Okay.

823
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,340
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

824
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,300
- Goodbye.
- You're so busy.

825
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,460
Next time.

826
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,660
I'll call you.

827
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,060
Goodbye.

828
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,300
I think Mr. Lin

829
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,300
looked a little

830
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,100
nervous.

831
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,980
Maybe he was faking it.

832
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,380
Mr. Lin is insincere,

833
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,300
and Mr. Qi is pretentious.

834
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,780
Their behaviors

835
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
are different,

836
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,180
but I've got this feeling

837
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,420
they're the same

838
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,300
kind of people.

839
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,540
Right?

840
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,300
Man,

841
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,740
how much do you know

842
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,260
about him?

843
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,620
The Lin Family's Guotai Group
is low-profile.

844
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,260
The boss is a Chinese-American.

845
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,100
He came here many years ago

846
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,900
and started the company in Huqing.

847
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
In recent years,

848
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
his business

849
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,340
has been extended to
all over the country.

850
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,980
I met Sheng

851
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,020
in Gang City.

852
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,500
At first, I didn't know

853
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,740
he was the Lin Family's heir.

854
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,540
I only felt

855
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,180
he was a business genius.

856
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,140
As his business grew,

857
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,660
I realized

858
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,020
he came from a big family.

859
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,340
Man, have you talked to him

860
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,100
about the details

861
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,450
of the project?

862
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,460
They're investors

863
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,860
playing with financial leverage.

864
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,380
They're not interested in

865
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,580
entity industry.

866
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,660
He doesn't care about

867
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,980
the

868
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,540
Tuan Island Market itself.

869
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,060
It'll serve as the source

870
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,180
of cash flow,

871
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,180
and they can use the leverage

872
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,860
- to...
- Enough.

873
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,420
You're an accountant

874
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,700
instead of a professor.

875
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,900
Stop teaching us.

876
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,780
Here's my word.

877
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,700
Mr. Lin

878
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,660
can invest in our project.

879
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,380
As long as he doesn't

880
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,180
drag things out or talk too much,

881
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,900
he'll be my friend.

882
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,100
You wear a suit every day.

883
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,740
Can you stop being so rude?

884
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,580
No problem.

885
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,380
Man,

886
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,460
just in case,

887
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,420
I think you should know more

888
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,220
about Mr. Lin's business operation.

889
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,060
Yes.

890
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,380
Zixuan is right.

891
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,820
Hello.

892
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,940
Xuan,

893
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,380
can you come home

894
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,220
early today?

895
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,780
Bin will have dinner

896
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,660
with us.

897
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,180
Binbin?

898
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,700
What are you up to?

899
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Nothing.

900
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,060
Please have faith in Bin, okay?

901
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,820
See you later.

902
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,660
We'll be waiting.

903
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,980
Okay.

904
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,020
It's okay.

905
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,620
Just a small chat.

906
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,260
Do you have to cook?

907
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,300
You're not helping.

908
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,180
At least stop talking.

909
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,820
You know she's smart, don't you?

910
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,860
I don't know

911
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,220
if I can help her.

912
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,140
Get the rice.

913
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,820
What's all this

914
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,180
about?

915
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,060
Come on, Xuan.

916
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,140
Give me the bag.

917
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,780
You must be tired.

918
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,020
Look, someone needs

919
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,340
a compliment.

920
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,460
Not a big deal.

921
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,340
Bin, you'll cook next time.

922
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,180
He made this for you.

923
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,540
You're not arguing.

924
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,820
What a surprise.

925
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,820
You never liked it
when we argued at home,

926
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,940
and now you're not used to this.

927
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,900
Ms. Wen, can I ask you a question?

928
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,620
Should we argue or not?

929
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,900
Sometimes.

930
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,220
No problem.

931
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,120
Here, Xuan.

932
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,380
The fish is fresh.

933
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,940
Come on. Eat shrimps.

934
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,700
Shrimps.

935
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,540
Chicken feet.

936
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,380
What's wrong?

937
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,460
Good news.

938
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,540
Good news.

939
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,620
The gun case is closed.

940
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,940
- Really?
- The withdrawal of Bin's punishment

941
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,220
is under approval.

942
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,210
That's wonderful.

943
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,940
Why didn't you tell me?

944
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,380
You were acting really strange.

945
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
However...

946
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,880
Don't pause in the middle of a sentence.

947
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,860
Can you finish it?

948
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,020
Here's the thing.

949
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,540
The case is closed,

950
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,500
but there's still

951
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,540
so much doubt.

952
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,260
The task force will continue

953
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,260
to investigate it.

954
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,420
Continue?

955
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,660
Will it affect Binbin?

956
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,500
Theoretically,

957
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,180
these two things
can proceed simultaneously,

958
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,740
but we haven't solved the case,

959
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,220
so they won't

960
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,260
approve it.

961
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,060
We still need to wait?

962
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,820
Can you tell me

963
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,100
when you can

964
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,540
solve the case?

965
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,220
It's hard to say.

966
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,460
What does that mean?

967
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,860
Bin,

968
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,620
if I dig into it,

969
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,580
I'll have to investigate Tuan Island.

970
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,580
Then do it.

971
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,720
Who's involved

972
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,690
in this project?

973
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,220
My sister, your wife.

974
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,020
You'll investigate your wife.

975
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,540
Oh, no. You need to avoid that.

976
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,580
If that's the case,

977
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,420
who else

978
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,260
can investigate it?

979
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,940
Someone will do it.

980
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,620
However, no matter who it is,

981
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,820
he'll have to start over.

982
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,180
Start over?

983
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,340
No. I have to go back to work.

984
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,460
I get it.

985
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,660
If I don't

986
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,780
give up the project,

987
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,220
you won't be able to work,

988
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,020
and you won't be able to
get your job back,

989
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,180
right?

990
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,500
My sister gave up the project.

991
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,820
You can be assured,

992
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,980
and I made a contribution.

993
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,580
Stop it.

994
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,980
What do you want?

995
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,860
You released Bao.

996
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,260
Is there a new suspect?

997
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,660
He's still the major suspect.

998
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,540
You don't have enough evidence.

999
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,500
But it doesn't mean

1000
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,420
he's clean.

1001
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,740
Why can't you go easy on him?

1002
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,100
Even if the real criminal

1003
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,980
shows up one day,

1004
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,720
you won't be able to notice him.

1005
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,580
We have reasons to suspect Bao Chenyan.

1006
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,420
You have a problem?

1007
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
Based on Chen Yiming's statement,

1008
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,460
Bao ordered him to knock you out

1009
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,380
and steal the gun,

1010
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,220
okay?

1011
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,300
I remember Bao

1012
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,300
asked you over,

1013
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,220
and you had no time,

1014
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,820
but you told him your location

1015
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,780
and the capture mission,

1016
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,860
right?

1017
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,780
It was a coincidence.

1018
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,660
- It doesn't count.
- Coincidence?

1019
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,940
Fine. Let me ask you.

1020
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,140
When you were chasing Sun Changhai,

1021
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,180
he could've shot you,

1022
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,020
but he didn't.

1023
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,620
Do you think you got lucky?

1024
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,340
Chen Yiming told us

1025
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,700
your dear Bao

1026
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,580
helped Sun Changhai

1027
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,460
to escape,

1028
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,700
and he told him not to hurt you.

1029
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,900
What else could it be?

1030
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,460
Wen Binbin,

1031
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,900
calm down and think it through.

1032
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,300
Do you really think

1033
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,980
Bao Chenyan is completely innocent?

1034
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,060
I...

1035
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,340
Hello.

1036
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,220
Okay, I got it.

1037
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,380
Follow me.

1038
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
I'll show you something.

1039
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,340
It's midnight.

1040
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,060
Why are we here?

1041
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,940
What the hell?

1042
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,060
You'll find out.

1043
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,660
Mr. Tai.

1044
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,700
Mr. Tai?

1045
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,420
Bin.

1046
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,660
Come in.

1047
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,140
Go.

1048
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,940
Commissar Sun.

1049
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,780
Wen Binbin.

1050
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,420
I hereby inform you
that based on our investigation

1051
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,220
and with the approval
of the procuratorate

1052
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,660
and the Provincial Department,

1053
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,180
the following decision is made.

1054
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,940
Withdraw the decision
on your suspension

1055
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,340
and give you a major demerit.

1056
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,220
Given your significant contribution,

1057
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,380
you are exempt from criminal punishment.

1058
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,060
(Files)

1059
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,540
Come on.

1060
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,700
Wen Binbin,

1061
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,060
welcome back.

1062
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,700
(I'm not cut out to be
a policeman, right?)

1063
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,100
(How could I lose the gun?)

1064
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,420
(Dad.)

1065
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,500
(I'm so sorry.)

1066
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,980
Put on the uniform

1067
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,540
and be a policeman.

1068
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,820
It's also a glory.

1069
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,780
Bin.

1070
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,180
Dad.

1071
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,420
Promise me.

1072
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,340
You have to pass on

1073
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,620
the glory.

1074
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,220
Sister.

1075
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,500
I'm so useless, right?

1076
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,510
Otherwise, why would I be suspended?

1077
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,620
It's okay. I'm here.

1078
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,420
You lost the gun.

1079
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,660
Just find it!

1080
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,020
I just want to find my gun.

1081
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,060
Am I wrong?

1082
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,100
You only want to

1083
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,260
protect your own dignity.

1084
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,220
You let

1085
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,980
the shooter escape again and again.

1086
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,260
Is this what you've got?

1087
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,660
If you hadn't lost the gun,

1088
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,620
none of this would have happened!

1089
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,300
Fan.

1090
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,140
Can you give me a chance?

1091
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,980
Can you give us a chance?

1092
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,220
If you can get your job back,

1093
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,700
I'll be your girlfriend.

1094
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,780
Someone must've

1095
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,500
set me up for losing the gun.

1096
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,540
When we figure it out,

1097
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,060
can I get my job back?

1098
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,820
