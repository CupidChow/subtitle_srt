00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,740
(Two months ago)

2
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,240
Why are you up so late?

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
I don't want to

4
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,960
wake you.

5
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
So I didn't go upstairs.

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,960
Is that so?

7
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,760
Or are you avoiding me?

8
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
I was just

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,520
following the rules.

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,920
Don't say that.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
I know everything.

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
If you want to protect him,

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,880
he wouldn't end up like that.

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Xuan.

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,240
Losing gun is

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,320
a very serious mistake.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,000
I think the punishment

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,800
is reasonable.

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,520
You know the rules.

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,560
I can't give up my principles

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,800
because Bin is your younger brother.

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,400
I didn't ask you to
give up your principles.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,440
I just want you to stand up for him.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,840
Does this mean giving up your principles?

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,360
I know you're the leader.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,360
But I just want you to

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,440
say something for him

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,840
under the premise of not
violating the regulations.

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm doing it for his own good.

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,520
He never get his work done.

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,840
He's always hanging out

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,840
with his friends.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
- Does he even count as a police?
- What are you talking about?

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,640
I think

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
he needs this lesson.

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,640
It's good for him in the future.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Okay.

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,560
How about you?

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,040
You never say nice things about him.

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
In your eyes, he's nothing.

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
I thought you were just hard on him.

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
Now I see,

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,800
to you, he's just my brother.

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,600
My dad was right.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,720
You never see yourself

46
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,210
as a part of our family.

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,440
What, your dad said that?

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,280
Your dad

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,240
thought so?

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,640
Wen Zixuan, you know that

51
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
ever since I met your dad

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,240
when did he ever consider
me as his family?

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,320
Dad, mom.

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
Don't fight.

55
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Feifei.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
We're not fighting.

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,040
Sorry, honey.

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,440
I was talking a little loud.

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,880
Did I wake you up?

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,040
It's okay, I'm here for you.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,500

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,500
=Episode 4=

63
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,000
(Birkin Paris Club)

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
Bao, I asked Da Pao

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,200
what happened today.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,480
Someone's trying to

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
pick a fight between us and Dian Lao'er.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
Fortunately, we didn't go along,

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,520
or it would've played
right into someone else's hands.

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,520
So you

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,080
called Xing Liang.

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
You thought it was me?

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,360
You thought I told Xing Liang?

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Then who were you calling

75
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,000
in the car?

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
But according to reliable sources,

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,920
that person is probably
from Da An Alliance.

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
There are gangs specializing in dirty work.

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,560
Get someone to check it out.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,240
That's it.

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,760
- Who's that?
- It's nothing.

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,480
You're always making excuses
to go to the bathroom.

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
Hurry up and fasten your seatbelt.

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,360
They won't fight, right?

85
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
Oh crap.

86
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,320
I shouldn't have said that.

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
If Bao asked you himself,

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,640
you knew and didn't report it,
that's harboring a criminal.

89
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm not.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,320
What do you want to do

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,800
with these chains?

92
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,200
Are you playing the Ghost?

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,800
Some people use these to capture ghosts.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,960
I use these

95
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,600
to lock up traitors.

96
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't say that.

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
There's no traitor.

98
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,680
Give it to me.

99
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,600
What's going on?

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
So you've prepared the

101
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,040
torture device, huh?

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Do it.

103
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
Fine, I'll hang myself.

104
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,720
From now on,

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,880
don't contact me.

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
He didn't mean that, Bin, calm down.

107
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,380
Drop the act.

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,200
Did you see me

109
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,160
calling Xing Liang?

110
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,320
I didn't say that
I saw you calling Xing Liang.

111
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
So now you feel wronged.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
I...

113
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,980
Bao.

114
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,280
I never said he called Xing Liang.

115
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,120
You can check

116
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,880
his call records,

117
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,280
wouldn't that clear things up?

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,240
Okay.

119
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,480
After all these years as brothers,

120
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,000
you don't even trust me.

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
You can check it,

122
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
but if you really want to do it,

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
you should check everything.

124
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,380
(Captain's Office)
Captain Xing,

125
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,440
based on the info from Na Meng
Public Security Bureau

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,080
combined with the clues
provided by Bin,

127
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,760
we can confirm that the suspect

128
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,120
is Sun Changhai.

129
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,600
(Resident Information Form)
We are tracking his location

130
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
based on his identity information.

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,440
You can see that

132
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
according to his identity information,

133
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,200
there has been

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
no trace of him

135
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
for the past seven months.

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,520
Besides,

137
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,320
look at this phone number
registered under his name,

138
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,000
where did he get it from?

139
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,160
Where does he stay?

140
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,200
Doesn't he stay in hotels?

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,400
Who does he contact?

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
Do you understand?

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,680
So he has another identity.

144
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
And…

145
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
the person Dian Lao'er called,

146
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,880
based on his speech habits,

147
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,960
he's definitely not from the north.

148
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,880
So are you saying that

149
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,040
this clue was

150
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,880
planted to mislead us.

151
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,920
We should investigate
Sun Changhai first.

152
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,480
It's Bin.

153
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,350
Say something.

154
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,880
You've made a name for yourself today.

155
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
You should at least give me some credit.

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Credit?

157
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
How about teaching you a lesson?

158
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,040
Wen Binbin.

159
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,770
You just keep hanging out
with Bao Chenyan.

160
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,800
Have you forgotten

161
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,720
that you are

162
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
a police officer?

163
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,120
Tell me,

164
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,490
why didn't you report it today?

165
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,560
You just keep messing arouond.

166
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,960
Let's see how far you get.

167
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,920
Captain Xing, is Bin framed?

168
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,160
If it weren't for

169
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,960
our surveillance,

170
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,560
he wouldn't have been able to

171
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,880
pull off the act today.

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,520
Don't worry.

173
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,760
Bao Chenyan is close to Bin.

174
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,240
He won't make things difficult for Bin.

175
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,240
Besides, this kid is smart.

176
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,680
He knows that

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
we tampered with Dian Lao'er's phone.

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I trust him.

179
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,840
How is it?

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,800
Did you hear clear?

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
If there's nothing else,
I'll leave first.

182
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
Anyway,

183
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,220
don't call me from now on.

184
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,480
- Bin.
- Move.

185
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
It's a misunderstanding.

186
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,400
- Move!
- Let's talk it out.

187
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,360
Get out of my way.

188
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
Bin.

189
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,240
Calm down.

190
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,040
I think we need to sit down

191
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,480
and talk.

192
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,360
What's there to talk about?

193
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
You said we're brothers,

194
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,960
but when there's danger,

195
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,600
you didn't tell me.

196
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,960
If you can't trust me,

197
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
what's the point?

198
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,760
It's better to part ways and
save ourselves the trouble.

199
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,080
Get out of the way.

200
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,200
Should we send someone to check it out?

201
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,600
No need for that.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,160
If he can't handle this,

203
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,840
how will he get by there in the future?

204
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,880
But,

205
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,600
(Captain's Office)
Bin is one of us and

206
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
has helped us a lot.

207
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,800
If he gets into trouble over this...

208
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,800
Alright, you all just
want to protect him.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,840
Alright.

210
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,360
Then,

211
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,040
send someone

212
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,680
to check on him in 30 minutes.

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Okay.

214
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,960
Bao Chenyan is fine.

215
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,400
But Dian Lao'er is

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
up to something.

217
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,880
This guy is a madman.

218
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,840
In the past, Bao Chenyan

219
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
can handle him,

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,160
but with the renovation of Tuan Island,

221
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
there's huge interests at stake.

222
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm afraid that there will be
no peace in the future.

223
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,440
So,

224
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,280
we must keep an eye on these two.

225
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,440
That's how we can ensure social stability.

226
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,240
About Bao Chenyan,

227
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
you know,

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
although he's a bit crazy,

229
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
I can sense that

230
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,840
he wants to go on the right path.

231
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,560
If he really gets into it
with Dian Lao'er again,

232
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,000
all his efforts

233
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,600
will be in vain?

234
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,400
What kind of fortune

235
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,360
did Bao Chenyan have in his past life

236
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,400
to have you worry about him like this?

237
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Alright.

238
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,840
Aren't you going to check on Bin?

239
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,960
You should go.

240
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
Okay, I'm leaving.

241
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,620
(Captain's Office)

242
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,400
Bao Chenyan is a coward.

243
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,880
A coward.

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
If he's afraid,

245
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,000
don't pick a fight.

246
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,000
He even called the police,

247
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
such a loser.

248
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,400
What are you doing?

249
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,600
Are you insane?

250
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Boss.

251
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
If there's something you need,
just tell me.

252
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,720
Alright.

253
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,760
Rest assured, I will take care of it.

254
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,120
Alright.

255
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Lao'er.

256
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,760
Where's the list?

257
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,760
It's almost ready.

258
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,000
Give it to me.

259
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,300
(Li Tai, Wang Xiuzhi, Liu Yongxing)

260
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,480
Three shareholders?

261
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,880
Tuan Island only has three shareholders?

262
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,720
Well.

263
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,960
Aren't we going to

264
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,800
take action against A Bao?

265
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,680
I haven't had the chance to
check it out yet.

266
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
Are you stupid or what,
there's no fight.

267
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,480
I gave you five days,

268
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
and I'll give you three more.

269
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Hurry up and get me the
list of all the shareholders

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
- of Tuan Island.
- Okay.

271
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,840
I'll get it down.

272
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

273
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm on it.

274
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,080
On it.

275
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
Bao Chenyan,

276
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,070
how dare you.

277
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,400
You're a ladder-puller,

278
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,800
an ungrateful person,

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
a snake in the grass.

280
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,680
I treated you like a brother.

281
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,800
What do you take me for?

282
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,800
Don't think I'm afraid to hit you.

283
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,160
Binbin, you're good at it.

284
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,080
You have

285
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,000
the gift of gab.

286
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
Do you know where you are?

287
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
If you keep acting like this,

288
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,280
I'll call your sister.

289
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,360
And you can't blame me for it.

290
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,000
You're ruthless.

291
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,200
I apologize to you.

292
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Wen Binbin,

293
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,280
Don't give me that.

295
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,680
We are

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
down.

297
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,000
Well.

298
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,560
It's still the same.

299
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,720
You're still my heart,

300
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
my liver,

301
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,840
and three-quarters of

302
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,720
my life.

303
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,360
I'm really confused.

304
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,960
How did you manage to
fool my sister into

305
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,720
thinking that you're shy?

306
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,360
If you want to know,

307
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,980
I can tell you.

308
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,760
I don't want to know.

309
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
Binbin.

310
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,560
How about

311
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,400
we start over?

312
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,560
When I first met you,

313
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,000
I was your driver,

314
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,240
picking you up every day.

315
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,320
I'm always there for you.

316
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,280
How about that?

317
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
No.

318
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,040
Look at you now.

319
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,720
Don't ruin good luck with women.

320
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360
If that's what you want,

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,800
just give up.

322
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,280
I need to say something.

323
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,400
You might not like it.

324
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,240
You should find someone,

325
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,520
have a child,

326
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
then Wen family can have an heir.

327
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,200
Isn't that right?

328
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,840
So when you're old,

329
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,040
you can have a successor.

330
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,360
You'd have to see if I live that long.

331
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,960
What are you saying?

332
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
No need to do that.

333
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,720
You never know what might happen.

334
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,040
If it weren't for you

335
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
saving me from Ye Renjiang.

336
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,840
I would have died

337
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,960
a long time ago.

338
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,160
Brother.

339
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
Two million.

340
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,080
The contract.

341
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,440
As you requested,

342
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,160
I'll give you 10% of the
management fee for Tuan Island.

343
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,400
Let him go.

344
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Mom.

345
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,160
My son.

346
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,120
I'm so scared.

347
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,320
Dad.

348
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,360
You're back safe and sound.

349
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,920
You survived.

350
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,960
You're lucky.

351
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,520
Binbin.

352
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,590
Now you're the only man in the family.

353
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,680
You must act like a man.

354
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,520
Your sister

355
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
is so busy.

356
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
Her feet barely touch the ground.

357
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,760
She's tired.

358
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,720
Aren't you worried about her?

359
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,480
You're there for her.

360
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,160
I can speak with my fists,

361
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,400
but I can't use them

362
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,000
do business.

363
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
You sure know

364
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,760
what you're capable of.

365
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,920
Lately,

366
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm thinking what the Old Master said

367
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,960
before he left.

368
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,400
He said, "Chenyan,

369
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,680
you should be a decent person

370
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,160
and do decent things."

371
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,720
But Binbin, do you know

372
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,120
I often feel that

373
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,280
using my fists to reason

374
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,760
is very satisfying.

375
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,400
Actually, I don't blame Xing Liang for

376
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,960
suspecting me

377
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,720
at the slightest sign of trouble.

378
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,560
I know what I did,

379
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,360
so I can understand.

380
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,320
Why are you talking about this?

381
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,920
Binbin,

382
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,920
I don't want you to hang out
with me anymore.

383
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,920
I don't want you to get involved in

384
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,840
what I'm doing. Do you understand?

385
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,560
I think the Old Master was right.

386
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,520
You should be a police officer.

387
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,000
Because of his words,

388
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,160
you all want me to be a police officer.

389
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
But does anyone care

390
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,640
if it fits or

391
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,280
if it's comfortable for me?

392
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,080
What do you think

393
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,520
would make you comfortable?

394
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
I think it's good just
the way it is now.

395
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,600
It's not good.

396
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,720
You know,

397
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,120
the Wen family's business is big,

398
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,920
and Zixuan is just a woman.

399
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
You're the only man

400
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,800
in Wen family.

401
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,080
Wen Binbin.

402
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,320
You and my sister

403
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,920
can manage Wen family.

404
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
After all,

405
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,320
I'm just an outsider.

406
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,040
What are you talking about?

407
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,080
You're not an outsider.

408
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,520
You are the life-protecting minister

409
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,560
appointed by the Old Master.

410
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,200
And you promised to

411
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,400
take care of me and my sister.

412
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,080
Are you going back on your word?

413
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,720
(EXIT B/C, LIFT)
What's the hurry?

414
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,920
Don't rush me.

415
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm already here,

416
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,680
in the underground garage.

417
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Xiangyuan,

418
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
you needn't do this.

419
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
We're just

420
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,160
having dinner together.

421
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,680
This is my family's canteen. I chose it.

422
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,560
This place is for

423
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,080
people like you,

424
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,920
rich and naive. Okay, bye.

425
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
How many times do I have to tell you

426
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,680
drink less, and you just don't listen.

427
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,000
You are my heart.

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,040
You are...

429
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,960
Xing Liang.

430
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,600
My brother-in-law.

431
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,280
He's drunk, isn't he?

432
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,760
You're quite capable,

433
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,120
but don't tell my sister.

434
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,560
- Let's drink together.
- Get out of my way.

435
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,200
Bin, are you okay?

436
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,120
Take your hands off.

437
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,520
Where are you going?

438
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,080
You're a police officer.

439
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,000
You are people's servant.

440
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
How can you push him to the ground?

441
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,600
You're not a good police...

442
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,640
What do you want to do?

443
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,720
Get out of the way.

444
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,760
You guys really do flock together,

445
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,600
right?

446
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,720
Look at him.

447
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
Take a good look at him.

448
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,960
Is this how you

449
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
take care of him?

450
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,360
The Old Master was right about you.

451
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,000
Say that again.

452
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
- What are you going to do?
- Say that again.

453
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,760
- Move.
- Bao.

454
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,000
- What are you going to do?
- Bao.

455
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,560
Don't.

456
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,560
Why are you so arrogant, Xing Liang?

457
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,160
Why?

458
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,600
Look at yourself,

459
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,800
putting on a sour face

460
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,600
all day long.

461
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,520
Xing Liang, I'm telling you,

462
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,720
act like a man.

463
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Be kinder and more considerate to

464
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,520
your relatives and friends.

465
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,480
Don't be so heartless and

466
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,920
do such jerk things all day long.

467
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Say that again.

468
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,160
Say it.

469
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,200
- Xuan.
- What are you three doing?

470
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,160
Don't you know to
keep it down in public?

471
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
If I had come a little later,

472
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
would I have seen you three

473
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,380
rolling on the ground?

474
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,240
(Na Fan)
No, it's not like that.

475
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,420
(Executive Secretary)
It's just that

476
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,190
my voice was a bit louder.

477
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,040
I was talking loudly.

478
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,240
You know I have a loud voice.

479
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,800
Then he came looking for trouble.

480
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,400
He's a police officer,
not a security guard.

481
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,360
What are you doing here?

482
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
Li Xiangyuan invited me for dinner.

483
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,680
I was just about to go up

484
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,520
when I ran into him.

485
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Why didn't you go in?

486
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,840
Are you not hungry?

487
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,840
Alright, then I'll go first.

488
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,640
Bin.

489
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,920
This girl is pretty.

490
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
She's Tianyi's older sister, right?

491
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,880
Bao.

492
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,560
I don't want to get involved.

493
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
But I need to tell you.

494
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,400
It's chaos out there.

495
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,120
You keep an eye on him.

496
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,480
He has been with you
since he was little.

497
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,640
And he only listens to you.

498
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,200
This is my only request.

499
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,440
Today's thing is really not my fault.

500
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,520
I know.

501
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,160
You know Binbin is
very important to me.

502
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,760
He is my heart,

503
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,760
my liver.

504
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,970
He is three-quarters

505
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,200
of my life.

506
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,000
It's getting late. Let's go.

507
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,000
I want to chat.

508
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,720
Chat about what? Hurry up and leave.

509
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,200
I was just about to talk to her.

510
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,080
What are you doing?

511
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,920
Let's go.

512
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,760
Today, I'm a little drunk and

513
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,040
I want to say something to you.

514
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,160
Don't mind if I speak straight,

515
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,360
alright?

516
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,840
What's the matter?

517
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,720
You,

518
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,040
ever since you graduated
and started making money,

519
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,470
your neighbors

520
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,960
come to you for big and small matters.

521
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,560
It's become a habit over the years.

522
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
What do they treat you as?

523
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,160
A bank?

524
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
Listen to me.

525
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,880
From now on, just refuse all of it.

526
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,360
You don't need to force yourself.

527
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,560
You know my family's situation

528
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
when I was a child.

529
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,120
Could I have gone to university

530
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,480
if it weren't for

531
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,120
the help of

532
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,320
the neighbors?

533
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,680
Now that I've made some money,

534
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,640
and they come to me for help,

535
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,480
how can I refuse them?

536
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,720
- I can't do that.
- Alright.

537
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,360
Just forget it.

538
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
But there's an old saying,

539
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,100
help in emergencies, not in poverty.

540
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,160
There are too many of them.

541
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
Can you help them all?

542
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,680
With your little salary,

543
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,720
what can you do?

544
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,640
You need to

545
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,360
empty your own pockets.

546
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,600
Why bother?

547
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
Listen to me.

548
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,160
A man should

549
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,960
keep some money for when it's needed.

550
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,440
What's the point of keeping it?

551
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,240
How about this,

552
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,800
if they comes to you for help again,

553
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,800
tell them to come to me.

554
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,000
Why?

555
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,000
Forget it, I don't want any trouble.

556
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm trying to help you.

557
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,960
What kind of trouble could you get into?

558
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,640
No, thanks.

559
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,440
Waste my breath.

560
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,400
Well.

561
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,560
Here comes another favor.

562
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
Fei Zai.

563
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,090
Captain Xing.

564
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Where are you?

565
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,760
I'm having dinner.

566
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,320
Something happened.

567
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,240
Can you come back?

568
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,800
Okay, I'm heading back right now.

569
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,200
Here you go again.

570
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,000
Alright, I'm leaving first.

571
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,440
I've had enough.

572
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,600
Every time we eat together,
you do this.

573
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,240
You can continue.

574
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,600
You haven't even touched your food yet.

575
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,480
I'll take this.

576
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,920
- Alright.
- Pack this up.

577
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,600
No need for that.

578
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,840
That's for today.

579
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,120
Maybe next time.

580
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,240
Okay.

581
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,960
Three hundred thousand.

582
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
Why doesn't he just rob a bank?

583
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,720
Talk to him.

584
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Let's each take a step back.

585
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,200
Two hundred and fifty thousand,
is that okay?

586
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,760
They made it very clear.

587
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,080
Three hundred thousand.

588
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,720
And this is settled.

589
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,120
If you don't think it's appropriate,
just forget it.

590
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,000
But if anything goes wrong,

591
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,720
don't come to me for help.

592
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,560
That's too easy for him.

593
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,120
Three hundred thousand it is.

594
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't have time to haggle with him.

595
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
Just consider it as giving to a beggar.

596
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,600
That's the spirit.

597
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,600
Spend money to avoid disaster.

598
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock,

599
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,800
outside the long-distance bus station,

600
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,520
Jiangbin Holiday Express Hotel.

601
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,360
Captain Xing,

602
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,040
there are two entrances and
exits at the bus station,

603
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,480
three nearby intersections,

604
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,840
and four surveillance cameras,

605
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
with limited coverage.

606
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,000
And the square is

607
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,920
densely populated,

608
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
making it difficult for us to set traps.

609
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,440
Captain Xing,

610
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,400
should we get Dian Lao'er

611
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,720
to cooperate with us,

612
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,990
to reduce the difficulty?

613
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,600
It's said that Dian Lao'er doesn't care about

614
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,900
his life when he goes crazy.

615
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,760
I think

616
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
he cherishes his life the most.

617
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,880
He knows that

618
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,280
killers are desperate.

619
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,920
I think he's really scared this time.

620
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,360
Moreover,

621
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,080
he only cares about

622
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,520
Tuan Island.

623
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,520
He doesn't want more trouble.

624
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,160
So,

625
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,720
he wants to settle this with money.

626
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,920
So getting him to cooperate is

627
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
almost impossible.

628
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,960
Liu Yong.

629
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,840
How about this,

630
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,000
based on the situation on the ground,

631
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,600
make a detailed operation plan.

632
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,990
I'll coordinate with
departments to

633
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,240
cooperate with us.

634
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,200
- Okay.
- Let's go.

635
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,780

All teams, attention.

639
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,440
After the target appears,
focus on tracking,

640
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,040
and arrest

641
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,920
when the timing is right.

642
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,840
Looking for a job?

643
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,040
Legitimate?

644
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,880
Of course.

645
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,840
Here.

646
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,280
Don't you need to work?

647
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,040
What are you doing?

648
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,800
Over and over again.

649
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,320
Don't hang up.

650
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,330
Come out for lunch at noon.

651
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,620
- My treat.
- Jiangbin Bus Station.

652
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,830
- I don't have time.
- Please line up.

653
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,680
I'm busy.

(Jiangbin Holiday Express Hotel)

655
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,440
Dude, you want a job?

656
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,920
Thanks.

657
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,920
Jiangbin is so big.

658
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,640
Where should we look for?

659
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,840
Tian wants us to do it,

660
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,760
so we just do it.

661
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,480
Put some vinegar.

662
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,920
- It will taste better.
- Okay.

663
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,680
Dude.

664
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,080
Can I borrow a lighter?

665
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,920
You got a lighter?

666
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,840
Thanks, man.

667
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,680
Tian.

668
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,520
I've seen the person you're looking for.

669
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,080
The mole on the neck,

670
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,400
the tattoo on the hand,

671
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,120
and that necklace.

672
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,480
Yes.

673
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,560
Yes.

674
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,760
I've got someone following him.

675
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
I'll bring people over later.

676
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,640
We're definitely going to
catch him today.

677
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,480
Maybe we don't need to,

678
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,800
the police are there.

679
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,480
How do you know that?

680
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
I was just on the phone with Fei Zai.

681
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,560
The way he sounded,

682
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,600
he's probably on a mission.

683
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,440
And I could hear,

684
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,520
the loudspeaker from the station.

685
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,640
The shooter wouldn't be there, would he?

686
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,680
The shooter is actually there.

687
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,360
So,

688
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,240
what you're saying is

689
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,600
let the police do the catching?

690
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
I mean,

691
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,840
let them do their thing,

692
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,000
and we'll do ours.

693
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,360
Have them

694
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,160
guard the intersections.

695
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,680
If they can't catch him

696
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,600
and he gets away,

697
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,440
then we step in.

698
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,520
If anything goes wrong,

699
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,920
it won't be on us.

700

756
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,680
What are you doing?

757
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,590
I need to check the ticket.

758
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,000
Isn't the money the same?

759
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,480
- It says Shenchuan.
- It's the same.

760
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,440
No, yours are for the next one.

761
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,560
Don't touch me. I'm warning you.

762
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,000
I'll call security.

763
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,910
- Hurry up.
- Security.

764
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,760
Useless.

765
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,480
- Let go.
- Hurry up.

766
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,340
Come on.

767
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,060
(BOARDING GATE)

768
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,700
(Binjiang-Shenchuan)
Let's go.

769
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,960
Hello.

770
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Alright, I got it.

771
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,810
Driver,

772
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,520
stop the car up ahead.

773
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,530
We haven't reached the destination.

774
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,750
I got on the wrong bus.

775
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,840
Stop the car.

776
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,800
Excuse me.

777
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,340
(Binjiang-Shenchuan)

778
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,160
You guys stop following the bus,

779
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,560
he changed locations again.

780
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,720
Act smart.

781
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,440
Move!

782
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,900
(Occupied)

783
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,900
(Vacant)

784
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,480
(Bathroom)
Alright, I got it.

785
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,720
Hey,

786
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,160
you bumped me.

787
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,160
Say sorry.

788
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,600
Hey,

789
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,440
turns out to you're a mute.

790
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,680
A poor guy who can't speak.

791
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,590
Boss.

792
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,440
Boss.

793
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,320
Almost the sixth round,

794
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,040
what does he want to do?

795
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,920
I can't run anymore.

796
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,960
You're weak.

797
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,560
I'm dieting.

798
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,680
Are you done playing?

799
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
If you want the money,
just come and take it,

800
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,680
or I'm going home.

801
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,320
Datong East Road,

802
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,360
Tonight's Date Internet Cafe,

803
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,720
wait at the entrance.

804
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,920
If you don't show up

805
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,080
in ten minutes,

806
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,240
I'm out.

807
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:51,880
- Did you call 120?
- Is he okay?

808
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,450
- I called 120.
- Is he alright?

809
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,600
Buddy, don't worry.

810
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,440
Hang in there.

811
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,840
I want to go to the restroom,

812
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,320
I've been holding it in the whole way.

813
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,200
Don't run,

814
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,280
don't run,

815
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,120
boss.

816
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
Why can't I go to the restroom?

817
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,340
Make it quick.

818
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,460
(Wallace)

819
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,440
I'm going to Wallace.

820
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,320
Beijing time, 13:05.

821
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,600
Boss,

822
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,840
he's

823
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,520
too cautious,

824
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,960
could he have found out about us?

825
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,240
No.

826
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,400
If he did,

827
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,960
he'd end the deal.

828
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,760
Now,

829
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,760
it feels like

830
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,800
he's stalling.

831
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,920
Captain Xing,

832
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,520
we've traced the suspect's phone number,

833
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,480
at Wallace on Xinghuo North Road.

834
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,070
Wallace?

835
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,800
Fei Zai is there.

836
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,580
(Wen Binbin: You can get two burgers.
There's no hope now.

837
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,700
(Fei Zai: How do you know?)

838
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,620
(Wen Binbin: I ignore your
handsome face.)

839
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
(Fei Zai: Stop tracking me.)
Fei Zai, the suspect is at Wallace.

840
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
If you're still there,

841
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,000
keep an eye on him,

842
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,080
but don't do anything else.
