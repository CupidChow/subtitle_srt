1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,540
(Thirteen years ago)

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,480
Why sit here?

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,320
Why not go in?

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,560
Sit down.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,660
Let me tell you something.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,980
Go ahead. What's the matter?

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,040
Last week,

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,900
(Xing Liang, young)
I submitted an application.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,360
It was just approved.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm starting my new job tomorrow.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,000
A new position?

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,660
I'm going to the front line.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,160
The front line?

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,780
Does your foreign affairs office
have a front-line unit?

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,710
Where is it?

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,000
In Binjiang.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,660
Under the jurisdiction

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,600
of the Nanhai
Criminal Investigation Unit.

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,120
Binjiang?

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
Bao just went to Binjiang.

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,240
Now you're going too.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,800
Is it the same reason?

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,880
I was the last one to know

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,120
Bin was kidnapped.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,080
Xuan,

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm a police officer

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,120
and your boyfriend.

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,200
I feel ashamed.

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm a police officer,

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,520
but I can't protect the people
I care about.

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,760
My own family doesn't even trust me.

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
What's the point?

33
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,340
No one doesn't trust you.

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200
You're a clerk
at the foreign affairs office.

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,480
As for fighting and killing,

36
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,080
Bao is more suited than you.

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,240
This time, the leader

38
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,560
of the Provincial Department's
anti-crime task force

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,840
is my senior.

40
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,240
It's a rare opportunity.

41
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,240
And I'm from Binjiang.

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,020
I'm very familiar with it.

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,080
So...

44
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,800
So, you're going to Binjiang?

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,840
No, absolutely not.

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,160
Actually,

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,960
your family,

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,160
including you,

49
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,900
still hasn't really accepted me
deep down.

50
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,300
If you really accepted me,

51
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,460
would you not have told me about this?

52
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,540
So, you have to prove yourself?

53
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,540
I want to prove to myself

54
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,780
that I can do it.

55
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,580
I have

56
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,380
to get over this hurdle.

57
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,300
It's for myself,

58
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,820
and for you.

59
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,500
You should support me.

60
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,820
I said no, and it's no.

61
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,820
This step must be taken.

62
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,900
But you don't need to take

63
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,260
such extreme measures.

64
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,100
You're gambling with your life.

65
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,180
Your life is my life.

66
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,060
You don't have the right
to decide on your own.

67
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,300
Xuan,

68
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,820
I know you'll stop me,

69
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,100
so from the start,

70
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,340
I didn't dare tell you.

71
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,260
But now the leadership has approved it.

72
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,340
If I run away now,

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,180
do I still have any dignity?

74
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,620
Sometimes,

75
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,500
people need to be born again.

76
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,860
Zixuan,

77
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,860
please give me this chance.

78
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,940
Xing Liang,

79
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,620
no matter what you're like,

80
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,140
you're still my man.

81
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,860
I'll wait for you to come back.

82
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,900
If I don't come back,

83
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,180
don't wait for me.

84
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,700
Anyway, wherever I am,

85
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,620
I'll wish you a lifetime of happiness.

86
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,500
Pah, pah, pah.

87
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,740
What nonsense are you saying?

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,980
I want you to remember
every word I say now.

89
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,660
I'll wait for you to come back.

90
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Even if you come back lying down,

91
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,200
it will still be
our wedding registration day.

92
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,540
=Black&White Forest=

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,540
=Episode 11=

94
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,860
Bro,

95
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,900
I don't know what's wrong.

96
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,600
He insisted on seeing me.

97
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,020
I'll go back first.

98
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,460
Okay.

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,780
I'm going to Binjiang after two days.

100
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,900
We'll talk when we meet.

101
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,900
Alright, good.

102
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,340
That's it.

103
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,980
Stop here.

104
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,220
Goodbye.

105
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,160
Bao, you needed me?

106
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,420
This is the assassin's
physical description.

107
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,980
Get someone to draw

108
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,380
a sketch of him asap.

109
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,540
Are you saying

110
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,540
this can be given to Fei Zai?

111
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,860
Yes.

112
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
Also,

113
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,260
get our people out of the hospital.

114
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,540
Bring all our forces

115
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,700
together.

116
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,080
We need to find this person asap.

117
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,460
That won't work.

118
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,180
What if that assassin

119
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,260
comes back?

120
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,860
I'll be fine.

121
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,220
I'm worried

122
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,180
about Zixuan's safety.

123
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,100
What does it have to do...

124
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,140
They'll deal with my sister?

125
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
Think about it.

126
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,460
Since we joined

127
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,940
the Tuan Island project,

128
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,220
there have been assassins
at Banshantang.

129
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,820
Although it seems

130
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,460
to be targeting me,

131
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Zixuan...

132
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,660
Are you saying

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,860
this is not just targeting you

134
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,940
but everyone involved
in the Tuan Island project?

135
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,020
It's all my fault.

136
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,140
At that time,

137
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,220
I should've firmly refused your sister

138
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,460
from joining this project.

139
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,900
Don't blame yourself for this.

140
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,500
My sister is stubborn.

141
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,220
Once she decides something,

142
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,500
who can change it?

143
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,260
True.

144
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,220
Things have come to this point.

145
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,220
There's no use trying
to persuade her now.

146
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,940
You know.

147
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,620
The Tuan Island Market

148
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,140
is where the old man started.

149
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,260
No matter what,

150
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,300
I must keep it.

151
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,340
Dian Lao'er.

152
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,300
Let go.

153
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,140
Behave yourself.

154
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,660
Haven't you had enough of this place?

155
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,740
How about another two days?

156
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,780
Dian Lao'er.

157
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,380
I'm telling you.

158
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,900
You'd better pay me back the money.

159
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,260
Or I'll kill you...

160
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
I'll kill you.

161
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,210
Got it?

162
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,500
Let's go.

163
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,140
Look at these thugs.

164
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,460
Still acting so arrogant here.

165
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,880
They should be locked up
for a few more days.

166
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
Bro.

167
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,380
Mr. Chen.

168
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,740
You're here.

169
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,940
You don't look good today.

170
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,820
Are you too tired?

171
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,500
Come on, sit down.

172
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,340
As soon as I got your message,

173
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,180
I rushed over.

174
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,700
Thank you.

175
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,380
Look at me, always ready to help.

176
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,980
Shouldn't you give me

177
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,980
a Police-Civilian Cooperation Award?

178
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,820
I'd put it at home.

179
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,060
I thought about it,

180
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,940
but you know, with our type of unit,

181
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,580
the budget is really limited.

182
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,780
How about this? Today,

183
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,820
you tell us

184
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,220
everything you know.

185
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,340
That way, it will save you time

186
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,860
and cut our costs.

187
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,140
What do you think?

188
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,260
Sir,

189
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,820
what do you want to talk about?

190
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,340
Don't you know

191
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,500
what I want to talk about?

192
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
I've told you

193
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,540
everything I know.

194
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,860
I can't just make things up.

195
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,260
Yes, yes.

196
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,660
If you don't want to talk,

197
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,580
we can't do anything.

198
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,420
We're the police.

199
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,900
We can't force you.

200
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,660
If there's nothing else,

201
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,300
I'll be leaving.

202
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,310
At any time.

203
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,140
Alright then.

204
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,380
I just want to remind you.

205
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,720
Seems like two people are waiting

206
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
for you at the door.

207
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,060
These two people

208
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,060
(Police)
seem a little unfriendly.

209
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,740
But they're really persistent.

210
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,380
They've been waiting there.

211
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,140
It's part of your fault.

212
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,380
Why did you provoke them?

213
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,100
You might have

214
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,660
some trouble later.

215
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,100
Mr. Xing,

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,500
can you guys help me

217
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,060
with these two

218
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,900
extortionists?

219
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,760
What have they extorted from you?

220
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,260
They've got

221
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,340
a signed IOU from you.

222
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
We can't just stop them

223
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,700
from collecting their debts.

224
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,060
You say they're extorting you,

225
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,180
but you're unwilling
to tell us the full story.

226
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,100
How can we help?

227
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,450
Only with evidence can we start
an investigation.

228
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,740
But,

229
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,980
the good news is

230
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,220
if they

231
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,860
really harm you,

232
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,020
we won't stand by and do nothing.

233
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,820
Don't be afraid.

234
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,180
So, according to you,

235
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,900
to punish them,

236
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,140
I have to take a beating first?

237
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,820
What should we do then?

238
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,740
You'll have to make some sacrifices.

239
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,340
I've figured it out.

240
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,300
You're doing this on purpose.

241
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,540
No wonder I keep running

242
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,200
into these two troublemakers everywhere.

243
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,940
If you think that way,
then I can't help you.

244
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,860
You can hide here for a while.

245
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,500
I have to go now.

246
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,660
Bro,

247
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,260
since you're already here,

248
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,780
let's talk.

249
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,420
Talk?

250
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,060
Yes.

251
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,780
You asked for it.

252
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,500
It better be

253
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,340
something I want to hear.

254
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,020
Bao,

255
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,420
eat an apple.

256
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,340
Man,

257
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
set up a meeting with the investors

258
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,220
from Haicheng.

259
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,580
I need to talk

260
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,100
to them.

261
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,020
Actually,

262
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,340
since Ms. Wen invested,

263
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,460
we already have enough strength

264
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,540
to take over Tuan Island.

265
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,980
We don't need such a big operation.

266
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,380
Now, bringing in foreign investment

267
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,700
takes too much energy.

268
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,540
Also,

269
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,180
our share will get smaller.

270
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,100
On the other hand,

271
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,060
we already had the first round of talks

272
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,740
with Haicheng,

273
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,460
but because of Ms. Wen's investment,

274
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,580
we unilaterally ended the meeting.

275
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,180
This is actually a huge taboo.

276
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,420
I think

277
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,500
they may have some resistance inside.

278
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,340
Bin has a point.

279
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,220
Losing a gun,

280
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,820
shooting,

281
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,740
injuring someone,

282
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,180
and now,

283
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,180
I've been inexplicably stabbed
a few times.

284
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,660
This should be someone,

285
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,860
or maybe

286
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
a group of people,

287
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,860
setting up a big game.

288
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,260
I don't know how important

289
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,100
the Tuan Island project is in this game,

290
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,820
but I can be sure

291
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,140
that what they're doing

292
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,100
cannot avoid Tuan Island.

293
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,260
I understand what you mean.

294
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,500
If acquiring Tuan Island

295
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,980
isn't just a simple
commercial transaction,

296
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,220
then we must spread the risk.

297
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,660
We can't put all our eggs in one basket.

298
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Man,

299
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,660
I'm not talking about business risks.

300
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,140
You're in charge of that,

301
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,220
so I'm at ease.

302
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,580
I'm worried...

303
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,300
I know what you're worried about.

304
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,740
You're worried about Ms. Wen

305
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,820
and your family,

306
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,180
right?

307
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,460
Don't worry.

308
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,420
I'll try my best to negotiate
with Haicheng.

309
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,380
Mr. Chen,

310
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,220
it seems like you forgot

311
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,820
to mention some details
about Uncle Long.

312
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,860
I swear.

313
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,540
I've told you everything I know

314
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,820
about Uncle Long.

315
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,380
Think about it.

316
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,820
He's the middleman in this matter.

317
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,220
I'm really mad at him.

318
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,660
So mad it makes my teeth itch.

319
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,300
I didn't hide anything.

320
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,820
It's unlikely for me to protect him.

321
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,860
Do you know about Bao Chenyan?

322
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
Bao?

323
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,020
What happened?

324
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,300
He got set up

325
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
and almost lost his life.

326
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,300
I'm so busy.

327
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,820
One problem after another.

328
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,860
I haven't heard about this.

329
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,620
You've heard about it now.

330
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,860
We're friends after all.

331
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,340
Analyze it for me.

332
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,220
Who's most likely to be behind this?

333
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,300
Bao isn't easy

334
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,740
to get along with.

335
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,740
He's offended a lot of people
over the years.

336
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,380
That's right.

337
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,940
Bao Chenyan's biggest rival

338
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,180
is Dian Lao'er, right?

339
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,700
- No.
- Dian Lao'er is you, right?

340
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
Don't say nonsense, bro.

341
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,580
Think about it.

342
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,020
Where was I when Bao got hurt?

343
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,740
I was at home

344
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,020
with these two guys.

345
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,820
Wait.

346
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,940
Didn't you say just now

347
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,640
that you didn't know
about Bao's accident?

348
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,180
How come you suddenly know

349
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,420
that when Bao was stabbed,

350
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,660
you were with Sun Changhe
and the others?

351
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,220
You just told me.

352
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,980
Yes, yes, right.

353
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,420
I missed that.

354
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,820
There's one more thing.

355
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,060
Do you know this person?

356
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,100
Yes.

357
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,860
He's my cousin

358
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,380
from my second uncle's family.

359
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,700
Haven't seen him in over ten years.

360
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,460
He hasn't changed at all.

361
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,500
But

362
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,060
my cousin hasn't amounted to much.

363
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,940
He's been in jail for seven years.

364
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,140
Sir,

365
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,180
did something happen again?

366
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,660
Dian Lao'er,

367
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,020
do you know

368
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,780
what kind of price

369
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,480
you'll have to pay
for what you just said?

370
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,540
He has to be arrested, right?

371
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,580
Fine.

372
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,700
You can leave now.

373
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,340
Where are you going?

374
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,380
What a coincidence.

375
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,500
Let me tell you.

376
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,720
This is the public security bureau.

377
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,820
Don't mess around.

378
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,420
So what?

379
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,980
We're all law-abiding citizens here.

380
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,820
Right?

381
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,580
It's getting late.

382
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,220
Just arrange something for us.

383
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,060
What's wrong?

384
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
Not happy?

385
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,500
Alright.

386
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,220
If you guys are willing,

387
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,540
I'll make sure you're

388
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,580
well arranged.

389
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,740
Then hurry up.

390
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,580
Let's go.

391
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,020
Get in the car.

392
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,420
You have to promise me this.

393
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,860
Impossible.

394
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,380
I'm not negotiating with you.
What do you mean?

395
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm not discussing it with you either.

396
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,820
I'm doing business now.

397
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm cooperating with Bao

398
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,220
on the Tuan Island project now.

399
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,180
Even if it weren't Bao,

400
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,820
I couldn't just pull out any time.

401
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,300
Xuan, you know the business
better than me,

402
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,460
but I understand security issues better.

403
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
From what I can see,

404
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,660
the Tuan Island project

405
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,540
is...

406
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,160
It's absolutely not

407
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,300
a simple commercial project.

408
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,380
It's not that simple.

409
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,120
Why can't you listen to advice?

410
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,500
Drinking so much again.

411
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,580
Making money is temporary,

412
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,900
but your health is yours.

413
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,780
You can sneak off to rest.
No one will notice.

414
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,980
I can wait,

415
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,540
but my dad can't.

416
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,820
He's about to have surgery.

417
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,540
Tell me. Why did you call me here?

418
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,020
Tianyi,

419
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,820
about the man you sent

420
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,340
to the group chat,

421
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,020
one of my friends has seen him.

422
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,900
Who? Where?

423
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,180
Transferred. Have a look.

424
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,260
Go ahead.

425
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,260
During the last gathering,

426
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,420
I casually asked around.

427
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,860
My friend, a masseuse

428
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,420
at Tianshuige, has seen him.

429
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,800
He left quite an impression.

430
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,980
A masseuse?

431
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,620
She sees many people every day.

432
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,780
Why would she remember him?

433
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,460
In a disreputable place,

434
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,500
he pretended to be decent.

435
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,780
How could she not remember him?

436
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,500
Tianshuige, right?

437
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,340
See you later.

438
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,040
Pull your clothes up a bit.

439
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,180
You two

440
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,140
better apologize to me right now,

441
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,220
and I can still spare you.

442
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,620
I just saw you sneak around,

443
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,220
trying to get more people coming.

444
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,980
But just a few came.

445
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,100
Brothers,

446
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,740
get them!

447
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,540
Let's beat them to death!

448
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,860
The outcome

449
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,700
has been decided.

450
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,100
So?

451
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,180
Are we done?

452
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,380
If so, hurry up
and arrange something for us.

453
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,540
It's getting late.

454
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,500
Of course.

455
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,700
I'll pay the money,

456
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,820
but I don't have that much

457
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,380
right now.

458
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,870
I...

459
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,900
I don't have that much right now.

460
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,100
I can make a call.

461
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,580
I'll call someone to borrow it.

462
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,260
Then hurry up and call!

463
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,100
Alright.

464
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,380
I'll make the call now.

465
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,900
If you keep stalling us,

466
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,260
I'll kill you.

467
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,100
Understood.

468
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,100
Understood.

469
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,620
Hello?

470
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,660
Chen,

471
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,260
transfer one million

472
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,220
to my personal card.

473
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,180
As a loan from the legal person.

474
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,180
Mr. Chen, the available balance

475
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,020
for you in the company account

476
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,260
is only 40 thousand left.

477
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,130
Transfer it

478
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,100
from another account.

479
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,980
The legal person has an urgent need.

480
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Chen,

481
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,140
but the remaining funds

482
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,860
are for the Tuan Island project.

483
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,940
I can't let you withdraw them freely.

484
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,620
The company is mine.

485
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm the boss.

486
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,740
You're just a small finance clerk.

487
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,780
Do what I say.

488
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,100
No more talking.

489
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
If you talk too much,

490
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,700
pack your things and get out.

491
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,220
Mr. Chen, you forgot.

492
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm not an employee of your company,

493
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,300
and my salary isn't paid by you.

494
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,740
I'm here to supervise

495
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,580
your company's financial status.

496
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,660
If you want special approval,

497
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,100
call our boss.

498
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,540
I'm just an employee.

499
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,820
I don't have the authority
to make decisions.

500
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,660
It's fine.

501
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,980
It's fine.

502
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,580
Don't worry.

503
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,700
I have my ways.

504
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,260
I have many friends.

505
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,160
(Dian Lao'er: Need a million.)

506
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,280
(Can I withdraw it first?)

507
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,340
(Bro, reply when you're free.)

508
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,740
(Bro, I'm dying. Please reply now.)

509
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,780
Enough, enough.

510
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,300
I've figured it out now.

511
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,220
You're usually so bossy,

512
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,980
but in reality, you're nothing.

513
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,500
It's a bit late.

514
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,100
Okay, stop dragging it out.

515
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,420
We're hungry.

516
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,900
Hurry up and treat us to a meal.

517
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,740
Do you hear me?

518
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,220
You're hungry.

519
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,780
You haven't eaten so late.

520
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,940
No problem.

521
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,940
I'll treat.

522
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,260
Hurry.

523
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,340
Take them to the hospital.

524
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,680
It's considered a work injury.

525
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,460
Please.

526
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,060
Uncle Gong,

527
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,460
this restaurant
makes good Huaiyang cuisine,

528
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,420
especially this dish, Ruandou Eel.

529
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,740
You should try it.

530
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,900
Come on, Mr. Gong.

531
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,740
Let me.

532
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,660
Try it.

533
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
Not bad.

534
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,100
- It's good.
- Looks like Qi

535
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,460
knows your taste well.

536
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,300
Not bad, not bad.

537
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,220
Director Wang,

538
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,140
thanks for your help in this matter.

539
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,500
Come on.

540
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,500
Let me toast to you.

541
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,900
You're too polite.

542
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,260
If you're to thank anyone,

543
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,820
thank Mr. Gong.

544
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,340
For this matter,

545
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,900
he has worried a lot.

546
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,420
Uncle Gong,

547
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,900
I'll always remember

548
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,420
your care.

549
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,610
Come on.

550
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,580
Let me toast to you.

551
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,740
Seeing your juniors succeeding,

552
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,780
I'm happy as an old man.

553
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,420
This child has grown up

554
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,700
under my watch.

555
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,820
In the future,

556
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,100
you'll still have

557
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,420
to take care of him.

558
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,310
Of course, Mr. Gong.

559
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,490
Don't worry.

560
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,620
Qi

561
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,040
is a talented young man.

562
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,280
He has a bright future.

563
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,500
If I can help in any way,

564
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,660
I'll do it without hesitation.

565
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,460
Good, good.

566
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,140
This time, thanks to Mr. Gong,

567
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,780
I had the chance to meet Qi.

568
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,100
Such a talented young man.

569
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,860
Come on.

570
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,980
Qi and I will toast to you.

571
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,660
Come on, Uncle Gong. To you.

572
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,960
Sure.

573
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,100
Good, good.

574
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,820
May you be healthy.

575
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
Let's drink.

576
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,360
It's Dian Lao'er again?

577
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,660
Dian Lao'er

578
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,220
wants a million.

579
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,680
Seems pretty desperate.

580
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
This scoundrel.

581
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,100
He's so greedy.

582
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,340
Last time we gave him 300 thousand,

583
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,280
and now he wants more.

584
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,860
Does he think we're an ATM?

585
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,260
Ignore him.

586
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,400
Let him stir things up.

587
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,740
Get someone to check it out.

588
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,060
Don't let him mess up
the Tuan Island project.

589
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,920
Got it.

590
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,380
What's the evidence?

591
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,620
Bao Chenyan was attacked.

592
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,180
Isn't that the best evidence?

593
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,940
He got stabbed on the street,

594
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,220
and you think it's a conspiracy.

595
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,460
If I'm walking on the street,

596
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,400
and a flowerpot falls,

597
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,540
will you blame gravity?

598
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,300
You're just nitpicking.

599
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,380
That's right.

600
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm not happy. Can't I nitpick?

601
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,860
I asked you to manage
the family business,

602
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,220
but you said you couldn't do it.

603
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,620
Fine, I'll carry it myself.

604
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,700
But before the project started,

605
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,180
you never asked anything

606
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,420
and never showed any concern.

607
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,860
Now, the project is halfway through,

608
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,120
and you're telling me to stop?

609
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,620
Now you're giving orders. Why?

610
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,620
Because you're my wife.

611
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,820
More than ten years ago,

612
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,340
Dad gave Tuan Island to Bao Chenyan.

613
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,220
It has nothing to do with you.

614
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,460
Now you want to get involved?

615
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,540
I know

616
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,220
I have no right

617
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,780
to tell you how to run your business,

618
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,580
but your safety,

619
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,380
whether it's for our daughter

620
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,580
or for me,

621
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,500
is crucial.

622
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,340
Tell me what you know.

623
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,500
I'll make my own decision.

624
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,500
Within what you're allowed to say.

625
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,380
(Tianshuige)

626
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,860
Come on, sis.

627
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,580
Just stop it.

628
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,300
I didn't come here for the service.

629
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,820
Didn't Coco tell you?

630
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,560
Tell me what?

631
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,980
If you're not here for my service,

632
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,220
you're delaying my work.

633
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,180
What's the big deal with that?

634
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,990
Here, I'll top up a card.

635
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,000
Is that enough?

636
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,980
Good boy.

637
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,720
I'll treat you well.

638
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,820
After topping up,

639
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,860
ask anything you want.

640
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,220
Before I top it up,

641
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,100
look at this person.

642
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,220
Is this him?

643
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,140
Yes, yes.

644
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,220
That's him.

645
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,180
Even with the mask, you can tell?

646
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,140
Are you sure?

647
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,260
I'm sure.

648
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,660
I can recognize his eyes.

649
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,980
Alright, it's done.

650
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,270
Great.

651
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,640
Go ahead.

652
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,100
The bidding was over a week away.

653
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,020
Right at this moment,

654
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,240
Bao Chenyan was attacked.

655
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,100
From the scene,

656
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,340
the attacker clearly
did a lot of planning.

657
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,140
The key is the chosen location

658
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,240
wasn't Tuan Island Market,

659
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,110
nor was it Birkin Paris,

660
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,340
it was Banshantang.

661
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,140
Isn't that strange?

662
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,540
Also, Dian Lao'er

663
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,660
obviously has some connection
with the attacker.

664
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,940
He knows the danger he's facing,

665
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,890
but even then,

666
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,340
he refuses to cooperate with us.

667
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,300
What's he afraid of?

668
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,980
Also, those two people from Ninghai.

669
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,980
They are connected to Sun Changhai,

670
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,620
and Sun Changhai is connected

671
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,900
to the shooting case.

672
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,140
None of these cases are random.

673
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,090
Everything is moving forward
according to the track

674
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,260
set by the mastermind

675
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,490
behind the scenes.

676
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,940
This is a carefully designed game.

677
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,960
The key thing is

678
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,050
we don't even know
who we're playing against.

679
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,440
I don't want you to get involved.

680
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,440
You can't stand by either.

681
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,660
The unknown is indeed scary,

682
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,620
but what's scarier than the unknown

683
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,420
is watching the funding chain break.

684
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,380
Tuan Island is different
from other projects.

685
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,220
It's not just Bao's life and fortune.

686
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,820
It's our entire family's assets.

687
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,540
And now, the money has been invested.

688
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,660
I can't withdraw it.

689
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,980
It's impossible.

690
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,660
I know.

691
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,660
You can do anything you want.

692
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,780
But can you answer this?

693
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,580
Is this about the project

694
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,220
or about Bao?

695
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,780
It's about our family,

696
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,700
but Bao is also part of this family.

697
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,740
When Bin was very young,

698
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,140
he came into our family.

699
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,180
He blocked a car accident for my dad.

700
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,340
He saved Bin.

701
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,020
He's been through his fair share
of bloodshed.

702
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,980
And now, there's a chance to get out.

703
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,660
If I don't throw him a lifeline,

704
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,900
who else can?

705
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,220
Alright, I get it now.

706
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,300
Since we're all family,

707
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,820
I'm the one at the bottom.

708
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,860
If anyone is at the bottom,

709
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,060
it's gotta be me.

710
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,780
Every one of us

711
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,220
has seen you pull that sour face,

712
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,900
while I had to comfort you on one side

713
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,660
and apologize to others
on the other side.

714
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,020
You're at the bottom, huh?

715
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,460
I owe you, okay?

716
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,580
But I promise.

717
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,980
I'll make sure to be careful.

718
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,180
If I feel anything's wrong,

719
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,420
I'll tell you right away.

720
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,200
Come on, are you serious?

721
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,610
That's all the info you got?

722
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,680
Yes.

723
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,310
This is all I know.

724
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,980
He got the 498 service.

725
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,840
No overtime.

726
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,720
It's paid in cash.

727
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,380
I don't know anything else.

728
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,270
Think about it.

729
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,160
Is this info worth the price?

730
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,900
Right.

731
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,840
One more thing.

732
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,950
He didn't drive.

733
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,970
When he left,
he didn't take a parking ticket.

734
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,730
It makes it harder to find him.

735
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,380
I'm just a masseuse.

736
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,060
There's only so much I can know.

737
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,510
He only spoke two sentences

738
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,900
from entering to leaving,

739
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,980
and there was no overtime.

740
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,520
How would I know more?

741
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,630
Alright, tell me.

742
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,720
What exactly did he say?

743
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,060
He wanted me to massage harder

744
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,270
and help him fetch his pants.

745
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,940
My dear brother.

746
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,460
Do you think it's easy for me?

747
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,500
I used all my strength.

748
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,700
One massage for him

749
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,260
- is like five for others.
- Alright.

750
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,900
Take care of the pants. I'll leave now.

751
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,660
Wait, wait.

752
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,000
I just remembered something.

753
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,180
When I was helping him fetch his pants,

754
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,060
I found a key tag in his pocket.

755
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,820
What kind of tag?

756
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,860
It says

757
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,340
Xingyu something.

758
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,180
Right, right.

759
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,860
There's also a string of numbers.

760
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,100
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

761
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,620
Come by more often.

762
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,220
(Xingyu Pier)

763
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,960
Found it. Hurry up and come.

764
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,420
Xingyu Pier?

765
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,620
Isn't that

766
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,740
Dian Lao'er's territory?

767
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,260
Are you sure?

768
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,540
I'm not entirely sure,

769
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,780
but I followed the clue.

770
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,340
Should we tell Bao?

771
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,900
Not yet.

772
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,340
The situation is still unclear,

773
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,660
and Bao is still in the hospital.

774
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,580
If we alert them now,

775
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,840
Dian Lao'er might use it
against us later.

776
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,780
Here's the plan.

777
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,940
Er'leng, Big Eye Chen and I

778
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,900
will check it out first.

779
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,840
Don't act impulsively.

780
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,060
Okay, hurry up.

781
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,740
The food's really good here.

782
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,420
Pushing your luck, huh?

783
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,820
We're debt collectors,

784
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,380
not murderers.

785
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,740
When you're full and satisfied,
you won't miss home.

786
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,940
When the debt's cleared,

787
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,040
we'll treat you to something better.

788
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,980
Thank you.

789
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,660
What's going on?

790
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,860
Nobody's here.

791
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,620
Looks like

792
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,940
he's hiding on the boat.

793
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,840
Don't wait then.
Let's search one by one.

794
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,940
What are you doing? Come back!

795
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,340
Have you lost your mind
in that car accident?

796
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,180
Right?

797
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,560
That guy stabbed someone.

798
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,460
How could he just hide here so openly?

799
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,890
What should we do then?

800
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,940
Chen,

801
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,040
you're the smart one.

802
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,370
This is on you.

803
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,840
Er'leng,

804
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,440
take your people to search over there.

805
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,880
If you find anything,
contact me.

806
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,120
- Alright.
- Go.

807
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,180
How about us?

808
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,940
Let's wait

809
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,380
and observe.

810
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,780
Two Qs.

811
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,040
Pass.

812
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,220
Go on.

813
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,560
Two Threes.

814
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,960
Pass.

815
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,690
Can you be serious?

816
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,330
Fine. I'll be serious.

817
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,540
Bomb!

818
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,180
Let's play this for this round.

819
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,940
Let's do it the other way around.

820
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,650
The winner

821
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,240
drinks this pot.

822
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Fill it up.

823
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,030
All in.

824
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,300
Done. Come on.

825
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,580
Three.

826
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,660
Pass.

827
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,660
Pass.

828
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,540
Three.

829
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,360
- Can't take it.
- Can't take it.

830
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,500
I have never seen
such a way of playing cards.

831
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,580
Are you guys messing with me?

832
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,100
Is it fun?

833
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,340
Messing with you for what?

834
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,860
We just can't take it.

835
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,730
This isn't Fight the Landlord.

836
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,420
This is fighting against me.

837
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,460
Who threw trash onto my boat?

838
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,300
Come out!

839
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,850
- Come out!
- Come out!

840
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,020
- Come out!
- Search!

841
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,060
Come out!

842
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,260
Search over there!

843
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,500
- Come out!
- Come out!

844
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,380
What are you doing?

845
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,860
Come out!

846
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,650
Sit here.

847
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,620
Do you think that person looks like him?

848
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,360
Chen, go around and block him.

849
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,740
Er'leng, block the exit.

850
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,830
Okay.

851
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,540
Oh, my.

852
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,780
Stay close.

853
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,020
I'm here.

854
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,340
Be careful.

855
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,540
This side.

856
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,580
