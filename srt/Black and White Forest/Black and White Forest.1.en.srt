has seized every opportunity
to make money.

194
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,860
The best part is

195
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,860
he spends other people's money,

196
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,820
and they need to respect him

197
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,140
and call him a philanthropist.

198
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Don't you agree?

199
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,700
Dian Lao'er!

200
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,220
You don't want your tongue, do you?

201
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,940
(Jie: Wu was caught by Dian Lao'er.)

202
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,020
How dare you hurt Wu?

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,100
(Wen Binbin,
Suspended Police Officer of Binjiang CIU)

204
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,020
I just went to the bathroom. Step back!

205
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,140
Step back!

206
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,220
What the hell?

207
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,540
They caught Wu.

208
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,860
What?

209
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,060
Start.

210
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,420
Liu Yong!

211
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,820
Dian Lao'er.

212
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,700
You spent a lot of time in jail.

213
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,460
How dare you make a scene

214
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,940
right here?

215
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,940
Watch your language.

216
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,540
- Who are you talking to?
- You!

217
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,460
Say it again!

218
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,580
Watch your mouth!

219
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,820
I was wondering who it was.

220
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Bin, it's you.

221
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,900
Dian Lao'er.

222
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,740
I'm impressed.

223
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,220
You haven't learned

224
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,860
your lesson, have you?

225
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,380
Can't you just give me a break

226
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,220
for games?

227
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,620
Well, how about this?

228
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,420
Release Wu

229
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,460
and apologize to Binbin,

230
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,820
and it's over.

231
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,260
That's it.

232
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,540
Apologize for what?

233
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,220
Ask my brothers

234
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,260
if they can accept it.

235
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,720
- No!
- No!

236
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,060
Lao'er.

237
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,740
You had your chance.

238
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,380
Take him down!

239
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,700
Bao, don't do this
at the opening ceremony!

240
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,580
(POLICE)
I want to see my son!

241
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,380
Disperse the crowd

242
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,220
over there.

243
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
It's dangerous, okay?

244
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,540
- Got it.
- My son!

245
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,460
Wait a minute.

246
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,580
Wait.

247
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,300
My son!

248
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,620
My son!

249
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,610
The preliminary analysis shows

250
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,040
the victim's nose and mouth are clean.

251
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,340
He died before the explosion.

252
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,380
We'll find out

253
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,630
the cause of death

254
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
after the autopsy.

255
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,050
- Mr. Xing.
- Liu Yong, how's it going?

256
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,350
Based on the investigation,

257
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,420
the explosion was caused by a gas leak.

258
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,220
We only found Zhou Yiwei's body.

259
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,260
What about the gun?

260
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,040
No clue.

261
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,020
Liu Yong.

262
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,340
The gun can't disappear for no reason.

263
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,980
Someone else was there

264
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,860
before Zhou Yiwei died.

265
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,300
Look,

266
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,180
expand the search area.

267
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,700
Investigate every suspect.

268
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,060
We must find the gun.

269
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,030
Yes, sir.

270
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,180
(Birkin Paris Charity)

271
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,020
We need backup.

272
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,100
Inform the riot squad.
It's getting out of control.

273
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,220
Bao, Bao!

274
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,100
Mercy! Mercy!

275
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,060
Oh.

276
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,940
Big Eye Chen, are you okay?

277
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
Hello.

278
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,660
Mr. Xing,

279
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,180
there are gunshots at Birkin Paris Club.

280
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,660
What?

281
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,460
(Binjiang PSB)

282
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,340
If it hadn't been for

283
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,900
Dian Lao'er's men,

284
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,220
I wouldn't have

285
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,580
let the shooter get away.

286
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,940
It's impossible, okay?

287
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,180
Have you found any clues?

288
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
Clue...

289
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,820
Put the cup down.

290
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,020
This is the last warning.

291
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,420
You're making a statement.

292
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,500
I'm asking you.

293
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,060
Asking me?

294
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,420
You asked a lot of questions.

295
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,420
Did you write them down?

296
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,700
Yes, all of them.

297
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,940
Why did you write

298
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,630
that Bao Chenyan's people started it?

299
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,380
Didn't they start it?

300
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,860
I told you

301
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,760
Dian Lao'er's people

302
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,540
provoked them first.

303
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,740
That's the point.

304
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,900
Write that down.

305
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,260
How could you make such a mistake?

306
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,460
You're lucky.

307
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,300
If it was someone else,

308
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,820
you'd get a complaint.

309
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,380
Don't you agree?

310
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,740
Sit down!

311
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,620
We're brothers.

312
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,140
Why are you so mean?

313
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,540
Well,

314
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,220
have you found any clues?

315
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,690
Don't ask anything

316
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,020
you shouldn't

317
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,100
know.

318
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,540
Now it's clear to me

319
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,730
that I don't deserve

320
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,700
to be your bro anymore.

321
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,260
I'm hurt.

322
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,660
Your statement.

323
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,140
If nothing else,

324
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,300
fingerprint it.

325
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,940
- Where are you going?
- I've done it.

326
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,220
I...

327
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,980
Nature calls.

328
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,500
Don't run around.

329
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,860
I was almost shot,

330
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,940
understand?

331
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,020
Why did you arrest me?

332
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,700
Tell me about

333
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,740
the gang fight

334
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,980
at Birkin Paris Club.

335
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,780
I'm a victim.

336
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,820
I'm a victim!

337
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,990
Why don't you

338
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,620
arrest the shooter and ask him?

339
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,740
Bao Chenyan,

340
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,660
let me teach you the basic law.

341
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,580
We didn't ask you

342
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,060
to come here to have a chat

343
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,020
with us.

344
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,780
It was a gang fight.

345
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,940
We can lock you up for a week

346
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,780
for introspection.

347
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,580
By the way,

348
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,580
I heard the detention center
just changed the cook.

349
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,260
You can try the food

350
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,980
and see if it's different

351
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,460
from before.

352
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,540
Do you have the guts

353
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,460
to lock me up forever?

354
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,820
Excuse me.

355
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,220
Mr. Xing.

356
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,780
Mr. Xing.

357
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,820
Did Bin make his statement?

358
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Yes.

359
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,220
What did he say?

360
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,820
He said he didn't see the shooter clearly.

361
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,300
Just a vague silhouette.

362
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,020
Where is he?

363
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,740
He...

364
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,820
went to the bathroom.

365
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,940
Right here?

366
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,540
What a mess.

367
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,380
Hello.

368
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,320
Hurry up, I'm at the gate.

369
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,820
What's the rush?

370
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,660
Wait!

371
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,020
Fine, get back to work.

372
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,740
Wait.

373
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,260
Ask Bin

374
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,380
to leave.

375
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,220
Yes, sir.

376
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,900
What are you doing?

377
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,100
Bin?

378
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,980
What are you doing here?

379
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,980
I want to say hello.

380
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,380
Don't run around, okay?

381
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
If Mr. Xing finds out,

382
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,540
he'll scold us.

383
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,340
(Camera 01, Zhangjia Road North,
Camera 02, Zhangjia Road South)

384
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,140
Replay it.

385
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,300
Binbin.

386
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,860
Captain Liu.

387
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,540
Are you busy?

388
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,020
I just want to say hello.

389
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,100
Caviar.

390
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,200
Lei.

391
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,220
Quan.

392
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,620
It's been a while.

393
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,260
We should hang out sometime.

394
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,620
Fei Zai and I found a nice restaurant...

395
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,140
What's wrong with you?

396
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,860
You're cops.

397
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,640
Remember who you are.

398
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,080
Don't chitchat in the office.

399
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,940
Someone slacks off all the time.

400
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,960
It doesn't matter.

401
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,220
If he has a bad influence on you,

402
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,780
I won't go easy on him.

403
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,260
Liu Yong, talking about me?

404
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,980
Why don't you say it to my face?

405
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,380
Stop alluding to me.

406
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,940
Is it funny?

407
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,000
Wen Binbin,

408
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,100
you're suspended now.

409
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,700
Know your place.

410
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,020
Get out.

411
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,820
Just go.

412
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Close the window.

413
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,300
So annoying.

414
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
Xuan?

415
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,660
Aren't you supposed to be at the gate?

416
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
Say that to me

417
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,980
(Wen Zixuan)
again.

418
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,280
(President of Wen Group)
Why did you yell?

419
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,580
It was not about you.
You got me wrong.

420
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,740
I was talking to Fei Zai.

421
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,780
Have a seat.

422
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,380
He asked me to go to a meeting.

423
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,700
Did you see Fei Zai?

424
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
He's lost weight.

425
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,020
He's thin now.

426
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
You never care about our family.

427
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,100
Auntie is taking days off,

428
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,180
and it's a mess, okay?

429
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,620
I need to deal with

430
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,780
my business and you.

431
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,620
Feifei only stays

432
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,060
at home for two days a month.

433
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,740
Otherwise, how could I have time

434
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,620
for this mess?

435
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,740
Yes, you're right.

436
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,580
How can you blame me

437
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,860
for buying dinner for you?

438
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,220
Is this for me?

439
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,300
For a dog!

440
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,180
I won't embarrass you

441
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,500
in front of your colleagues,

442
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,940
but can you be a good husband at home?

443
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,580
You can either give me a hand

444
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
or find a reliable maid

445
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,940
to do the housework.

446
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
I know.

447
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,500
A gunshot was just reported.

448
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,780
We're working on it.

449
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,380
Is Binbin involved in this?

450
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,980
I know your rules.

451
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,220
I don't want the details.

452
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,900
I just want to tell you

453
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,180
if he's involved,

454
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,420
deal with it.
It's been delayed for two months.

455
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,100
I'm more anxious than you.

456
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,660
We're interrogating Bao Chenyan,

457
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,140
but he's not cooperative.

458
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,060
The shooter was after him.

459
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,340
If he doesn't speak,
who can know the truth?

460
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,180
I talked to him nicely, but he...

461
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,740
Be nice to him, okay?

462
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,020
Maybe you can sit here...

463
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,700
- Just go.
- I... I'm leaving.

464
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,820
Eat it while it's hot.

465
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,860
You can go home.

466
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,700
Just go.

467
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,580
Okay.

468
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,180
Why are you here?

469
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,780
What time is it?

470
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,900
We're all busy.

471
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Come on, get out.

472
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,420
I know you're busy.

473
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,580
You should take a break.

474
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,860
I brought some food.

475
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,700
Hey, Caviar,

476
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,060
here's your century egg porridge.

477
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,540
Lei, your barbecue pork buns.

478
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,380
Is Dan here?

479
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,220
Dan! Your chicken feet
with black bean sauce.

480
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,260
Why didn't you tell us?

481
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,060
Bin,

482
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,020
thank you for...

483
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,820
Captain,

484
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,620
we're so hungry.

485
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,570
Bin is the best.

486
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,050
- Thanks, Bin.
- Thanks, Bin.

487
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,460
Give me two boxes.

488
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,420
Bin ordered this for you.

489
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,260
Let's see what it is.

490
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,780
Dry beef noodles.

491
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,180
Isn't this your favorite food?

492
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,940
Boss, it smells so good.

493
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,500
Come on. Have a bite.

494
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,940
I know you're busy,

495
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,420
but your stomach is innocent.

496
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,590
(Camera 01, Zhangjia Road North)
It'll

497
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,380
get cold.

498
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,300
I'm gonna eat it.

499
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,940
I can eat fast.

500
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,820
Fei Zai.

501
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,020
What do you want?

502
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,300
I can treat you to dinner sometime.

503
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,940
Don't you understand?

504
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,580
We'll stay up all night.

505
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,500
You just need to find a person.

506
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,220
How hard can it be?

507
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,510
Wen Binbin,

508
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,540
it's a gunshot.

509
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,300
Mr. Xing is serious about it.

510
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,180
Don't you know why?

511
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,980
So lame.

512
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,580
Someone saw it.

513
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,140
5 minutes before the gunshot,

514
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,580
someone sneaked out

515
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,300
from Lian's house through the wall.

516
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,660
What about his appearance?

517
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,420
It was too dark to see it.

518
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,460
But he's about 1.8 meters high,

519
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,500
and he's wearing

520
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,540
a dark-colored jacket

521
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,380
and leather boots.

522
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,740
They said he was not
from Baisha Village.

523
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,900
Yong,

524
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,940
don't you think

525
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,380
it matches the description
of the shooter

526
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,860
at Birkin Paris Club?

527
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
Is it reliable?

528
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,020
Did I give you any false information?

529
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,180
So, I'm thinking about

530
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,700
combining

531
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,380
the two cases.

532
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,180
Enough. You've had snacks.

533
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,820
It's time for work.

534
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,420
Oh, you can leave.

535
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,500
I...

536
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,460
What do you mean?

537
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,140
Am I useless to you now?

538
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,170
Hello?

539
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,430
Do you really want to stay here forever?

540
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,580
Are you hungry?

541
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,780
No need.

542
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,980
Don't flatter yourself.

543
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,780
Do you think I bought this for you?

544
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,700
Xuan bought it

545
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,300
to

546
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,460
feed a dog.

547
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,020
Fine.

548
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,620
It's Dian Lao'er.

549
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,700
Do you know he kidnapped Wu?

550
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,780
How could I

551
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,540
go easy on him?

552
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I know

553
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,660
you brought Wu here from Hugang,

554
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,500
and you're close.

555
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,660
But why didn't you call the police?

556
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,380
Officer,

557
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,460
don't you want me to become a joke?

558
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,020
How can I call the police for that?

559
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,900
Then why are you so sure

560
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,420
that Dian Lao'er did it?

561
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
How should I put this?

562
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,820
You believe in

563
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,620
evidence, right?

564
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,540
We have our way.

565
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
I asked him,

566
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,740
and he didn't deny it.

567
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,660
What about the gun?

568
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,620
Gun, gun, gun,

569
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,500
always gun!

570
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,860
Oh my god.

571
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,460
I'm a victim!

572
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,740
Victim!

573
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,780
Ask the shooter.

574
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,020
Bao, Bao!

575
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,220
Mercy!

576
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,500
You win! You win!

577
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,580
I turned around at that point

578
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,300
and saw him holding a gun,

579
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,260
and he shot.

580
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,100
He left immediately.

581
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,900
That's what happened.

582
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,620
I'm innocent.

583
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,980
To be honest,

584
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,330
I kind of

585
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,940
saved his life.

586
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,540
Actually, many people here

587
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,540
want me to die.

588
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,620
Dian Lao'er is one of them.

589
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,300
Why?

590
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,180
Because Dian Lao'er

591
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,940
has a dream.

592
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,860
He wants to

593
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,540
take over Tuan Island

594
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,540
from me.

595
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,460
Even though

596
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,740
I bully him

597
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,940
every day,

598
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,780
he's still

599
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,620
very determined.

600
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,380
The business of Tuan Island

601
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,300
is getting bigger.

602
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,380
He's anxious.

603
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,500
He came to me,

604
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,500
and I had to deal with him.

605
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,780
Bao Chenyan,

606
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,980
you're a big shot,

607
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,820
but you almost

608
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,900
died today.

609
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,240
You can go ahead.

610
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,900
However, one day,

611
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,140
you'll run out of luck.

612
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,740
Tell me.

613
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Who else wants you

614
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,460
to die except for him?

615
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,930
You.

616
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,900
Mr. Xing.

617
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,940
Got it.

618
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,690
I need to go.

619
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,260
Based on Bin's information,

620
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,260
we found a clue at the blind spot

621
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,680
on the east side of the village.

622
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,130
We still need to figure out

623
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,420
if the suspect is the shooter

624
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,020
at Birkin Paris Club.

625
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,530
Liu Yong,

626
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,780
visit the villagers

627
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,780
and ask them about it.

628
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,660
Find more clues as soon as possible.

629
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,260
When we get solid evidence, we'll

630
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,260
combine the cases.

631
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,120
Okay.

632
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,690
Mr. Xing.

633
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,460
What's wrong with you?

634
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,460
Can you make it clear?

635
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,700
I'm anxious.

636
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,540
What is it?

637
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,260
We've got the identification result.

638
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,740
It's a police gun.

639
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,540
(The bullet was fired from
No. 952776 police QSZ-92 pistol.)

640
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,900
(Binjiang PSB Crime Investigation Unit)

641
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,300
I stayed here all night.

642
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,140
It's so uncomfortable.

643
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,820
Binbin,

644
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,500
you like soup dumplings, right?

645
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,780
Let's have breakfast

646
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,540
- They're out.
- and take a bath to

647
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,500
wash off the back luck.

648
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,980
Bao.

649
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,660
How's Big Eye Chen?

650
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,260
He's fine. He's in the hospital.

651
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,860
Is he going to die?

652
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,700
(Xing Liang)
No.

653
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,940
Get in the car.

654
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,780
Let's go.

655
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,180
This place is so uncomfortable.

656
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,020
Bin, come on.

657
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,900
Come here.

658
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,100
Uncle Zheng.

659
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,060
Mr. Xing wants to talk to you.

660
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,700
Tell him

661
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,900
I have no time.

662
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,220
Please don't.

663
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,940
Mr. Xing told me

664
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,140
not to let you go.

665
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Please don't make it hard for me, okay?

666
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,100
Binbin.

667
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,820
He's looking for you?

668
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,620
Talk to him.

669
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,980
Go.

670
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,420
Get it over with.

671
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,540
We'll be

672
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,980
at the soup dumpling store.

673
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,220
Bye.

674
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,860
Just go.

675
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,740
Come in.

676
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,060
What's the matter?

677
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,050
Close the door.

678
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,660
Hurry up. I'm busy.

679
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,570
You're busy.

680
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,780
Busy with messing around.

681
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,540
What? Did you ask me over

682
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,700
to insult me?

683
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,060
I didn't offend you.

684
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,220
(Captain Office)

685
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,060
Wen Binbin.

686
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,900
Let me repeat it.

687
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,740
It's your duty to report

688
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,180
any information about this case to us.

689
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,820
The sooner we solve the case,
the sooner you come back.

690
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,660
Xing Liang, do you think

691
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,780
you're superior

692
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,060
in this outfit?

693
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,780
You don't have

694
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,780
faith,

695
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,900
perseverance,

696
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,300
or self-control.

697
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,940
You deserve the suspension.

698
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,620
That's very noble of you.

699
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,620
You never liked me.

700
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,940
You were always against me.

701
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,940
You played the victim
in front of my sister.

702
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,540
I don't want to break her heart.

703
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,180
Otherwise, I would've told her
who you really are.

704
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,060
Why should I be against you?

705
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,340
Who lost the gun?

706
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,220
Who's responsible?

707
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,620
I'm responsible!

708
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,100
But I took the blame.

709
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,340
Took the blame? How?

710
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Can you be responsible?

711
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,620
Do you think the suspension

712
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,780
is the cure for all?

713
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,020
The ballistics report shows

714
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,220
the bullet

715
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,900
