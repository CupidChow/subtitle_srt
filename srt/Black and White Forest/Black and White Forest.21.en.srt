1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,520
Don't play dumb here with me.

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,360
Let me confirm with you once more.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,480
Are you sure Liang will be fine?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,280
Your brother is handling it.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,600
There's nothing I can't handle.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,560
Don't worry.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,240
In a few days,

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,520
he will be back home with you.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,440
You can kiss and hug him then.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,340
You brat.

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,360
What on earth did you do?

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,960
You didn't cause any trouble, did you?

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,720
I definitely didn't do anything.

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,890
Right now, I'm just

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,720
a law-abiding good citizen.

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,240
As for Xing Liang,

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,640
does he have the face

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,200
to make me risk my life for him?

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,880
Our friendship isn't worth it.

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,720
Enough.

21
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,620
The reason I'm telling you this

22
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,920
is I feel like you've been anxious
these past few days.

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,840
I want you to relax.

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,400
But

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,960
don't tell anyone else.
I don't want extra complications.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
Got it.

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,680
Ms. Wen, the guests have arrived.

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,080
I'll go by myself.

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,280
How is Mr. Xing?

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,680
Ms. Wen's been really worried
these past few days.

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,700
I couldn't ask too much.

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,960
Anyway, it will all be over soon.

33
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
That's good.

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm leaving.

35
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
By the way,

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,840
my sister said you like this perfume,

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,300
so I had someone buy it from France.

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,120
Give it a try.

39

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,740
=Episode 21=

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,680
This morning, Wen Binbin took Xing Jian.

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
Make sure to find him.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
Got it.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,880
Hello, what's wrong now?

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,880
Keep an eye on him.

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,720
Tomorrow, he's meeting
the DIC.

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
Don't lose him.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,360
Don't worry.
Both Er'leng and I are watching him.

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
What could go wrong?

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Bye, I'm hanging up.

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,920
Go. Go forward.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,200
Where are you going?

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
Well.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Nothing.

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,600
I'm just tidying up because I'm bored.

56
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,880
Mr. Luo,

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,560
I've explained everything I need to.

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,360
You've also recorded the video.

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,160
When can I leave?

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
When I say you can go.

61
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,920
Well, can I at least call home?

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
This person is so annoying.

63
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,080
Why does he want everything?

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,000
He wants everything.

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,700
Should I just give him my life?

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Annoying.

67
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,610
What did you just say?

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Nothing.

69
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,120
Nothing.

70
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,920
Please, everyone, stay calm.

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,960
Please, residents,

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,720
evacuate the scene in an orderly manner.

73
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Everyone, don't panic.

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,040
Please, residents,

75
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
evacuate the scene in an orderly manner.

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
Er'leng.

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
Where is he?

78
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Go, go, go.

79
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,940
You all stay downstairs.

80
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,580
Fei Zai and the others
will be here soon.

81
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,120
Make sure to hold him there.

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
You didn't find him?

83
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
Smile.

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,600
Look.

85
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,040
He didn't lose any limbs.

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
He's perfectly safe.

87
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,560
I told you.

88
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,120
He's with me. Don't worry.

89
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,360
He won't get lost.

90
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Making such a big commotion so late.

91
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
You really are something.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Of course.

93
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,320
I'm telling you, Yellow.

94
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,320
You really worked hard.

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,720
If it weren't for you,

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
I wouldn't be here tonight

97
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,400
enjoying the night view.

98
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,200
Wait, why are you blaming me?

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,520
Blame them.

100
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,160
Their house caught fire.

101
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,720
Are you okay?

102
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm fine.

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,400
Look at how scared he is.

104
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,180
He's still recovering from the shock.

105
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Earlier, there were too many people.

106
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,260
He tripped and almost got trampled
to death.

107
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,760
Luckily, he was quick-witted
and found a corner to hide in.

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,620
Otherwise,
he'd be hurt just like the others

109
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,240
over there.

110
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
Bin,

111
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
should we go somewhere else?

112
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,540
Everything's going smoothly.

113
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,200

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,300
(Surveillance 02, Elevator 1)

115
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,200
Don't move.

116
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,120
Take this call.

117
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,400
Mr. Xing,

118
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
as long as you cooperate,

119
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,280
you won't suffer.

120
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,100
Everything is ready.

121
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,860
Boss,

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,030
are you sure you want to do this?

123
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Mr. Jiang is right.

124
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,960
We must chase down the fleeing enemy
with the last courage.

125
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,720
We can't sweat the details
when achieving great things.

126
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
To succeed,

127
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,200
we can't be soft-hearted.

128
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,720
Since we've done it, make it thorough.

129
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,640
Take care of the person

130
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,290
who wrote the letter.

131
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,200
Don't leave any hidden dangers.

132
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,780
OK.

133
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,740
(Siji International Hotel)

134
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,840
The leader only allowed you
to go in alone.

135
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,060
Relax.

136
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,940
Just repeat what you said

137
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,920
to the camera earlier.

138
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,980
Do you understand?

139
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,860
What I said in the video

140
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,060
is all a lie.

141
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,200
Those people outside threatened me
to do this.

142
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,580
Sirs, they threatened me.

143
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,540
What are you doing?

144
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,220
I knew I couldn't trust
someone like you.

145
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,740
Don't mess around.

146
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,380
Sirs, did you see that?

147
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,800
They're acting so arrogantly
in front of you all.

148
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,620
What else wouldn't they dare to do?

149
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,860
So what do you want to do?

150
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,380
I'm going to sue them.

151
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,730
I'm going to have them arrested.

152
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,740
Alright.

153
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,380
You're right.

154
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,820
You're arrested.

155
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,100
Choose.

156
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,220
Do you want to be dismembered
or bled out?

157
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,900
You're playing me.

158
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,900
Do you think
you're the only one who can act?

159
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,540
Bin,

160
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,860
should we go somewhere else?

161
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
I burned down your house.

162
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,620
How much is it? I'll pay you.

163
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,620
Such big talk.

164
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,140
If you're so rich, why rent my place?

165
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,260
Don't look down on me.

166
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,580
Get someone to give an estimate.

167
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,860
I'll pay immediately.

168
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,460
Okay, I'll find someone now.

169
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,940
You've got a great brain.

170
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,340
I'm glad we listened to you

171
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,240
and tested him first.

172
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,860
Otherwise, if he talked nonsense there,

173
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,780
we'd be screwed.

174
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,740
I was forced.

175
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,020
I had no choice.

176
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,020
I can't offend anyone.

177
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,860
Please, just spare me.

178
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,220
If it were up to me,

179
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,100
I'd just hand him over to Er'leng.

180
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,540
They'd handle it cleanly
and spare our worries.

181
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,020
No.

182
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,940
Give me one more chance, please.

183
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,060
I promise I'll be honest.

184
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,060
I'll never dare again.

185
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,260
Tell me what mistake you've made.

186
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,710
I...

187
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,620
Well,

188
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,300
I shouldn't have

189
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,700
been so greedy for money

190
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,640
and framed Xing Liang.

191
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,550
Then,

192
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
you gave me the chance

193
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,940
to correct my mistakes,

194
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,320
but I turned around and bit you.

195
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
In the end, it's all my fault.

196
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,710
Really, spare me.

197
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,680
I'll never dare again.

198
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,760
Please believe me.

199
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,860
Come over here.

200
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,900
Here's a chance to redeem yourself.

201
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,060
Do you want it?

202
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,340
I'll definitely come clean

203
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,220
and clear Xing Liang's name.

204
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,340
I'm not talking about that.

205
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,940
As for the rest,

206
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,140
I can't help.

207
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,820
Not necessarily.

208
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,860
(Jiahexin Hotel)

209
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,500
Speak.

210
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,060
I've done everything you asked me to.

211
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,740
We agreed on 500,000.

212
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,220
I want it now.

213
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,940
It's going to raise suspicion now.

214
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,420
Wait a bit.

215
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,940
I can't wait.

216
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,100
You're all fighting with Xing Liang.

217
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,580
You're all pushing me.

218
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,860
I've had enough.

219
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,420
Today, I must get the money.

220
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,020
Otherwise, I'll go to the police
and change my testimony.

221
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,220
If you don't give me

222
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,340
a way out,

223
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,900
I'll drag everyone down

224
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,620
with me.

225
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,500
You...

226
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,540
Wait for my news.

227
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,820
This guy.

228
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,100
He's acting pretty convincingly.

229
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,300
He's got the right attitude.

230
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,100
But it might not be just acting.

231
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,500
Right now, he's like a man

232
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,220
who's been caught in a bind,

233
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,300
full of anger.

234
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,140
He's mad.

235
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,100
How can he get mad?

236
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,220
If he weren't so greedy for money,

237
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,540
would all this have happened?

238
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,700
How do you know
he can contact the other side?

239
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,340
Last night,

240
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,260
they made such a commotion

241
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,060
but didn't take Xing Jian.

242
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,340
That means
they've got him under control.

243
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,540
Dealing with someone like Xing Jian

244
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,540
is all about money.

245
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,090
So, after everything,

246
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,640
they'll definitely contact each other.

247
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,660
Boss,

248
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,300
Bin has done

249
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,860
a great job, right?

250
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,460
Wait until we catch the guy
before we decide.

251
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,340
Don't act rashly.

252
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Make sure before you act.

253
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,500
- Stop.
- Don't move.

254
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,920
- Stop.
- Stop.

255
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,760
Don't move, everyone.

256
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,800
- Get out.
- Don't move.

257
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,820
- Don't move.
- Stop.

258
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,560
Hurry.

259
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,340
My brakes failed.

260
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,140
You almost killed him!

261
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,660
Don't get it wet these next few days.

262
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,620
I should've thought of this earlier.

263
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,700
If Xing Jian had died at this point,

264
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,940
not only would there be no proof,

265
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,700
but we'd be the prime suspects.

266
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,220
This is better than just paying

267
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,180
to silence them.

268
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,460
This was our oversight.

269
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,840
It's not really your fault.

270
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,060
Don't be too hard on yourself.

271
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,500
- Boss.
- How's it going?

272
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,920
The driver insists

273
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,400
that the brake system malfunctioned.

274
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,300
He refuses to admit
that anyone instructed him

275
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
to deliberately kill.

276
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,820
So, with our current evidence,

277
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,420
we can't do anything about him.

278
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,000
Though we didn't catch the mastermind,

279
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,380
at least we have his testimony.

280
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,440
Mr. Xing will be fine.

281
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,030
We didn't work in vain.

282
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,640
Let's go.

283
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,420
Let me help you.

284
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,980
No need.

285
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,660
Xing,

286
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,060
I'm telling you.

287
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,820
This is a new tea someone gave me.

288
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,900
Try it.

289
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,980
I haven't drunk it yet.

290
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,820
You're acting like you are

291
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,580
welcoming someone out of prison.

292
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,580
Good.

293
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,860
You can still joke.

294
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,980
It means you're optimistic.

295
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,940
Let me tell you.

296
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,620
Actually,

297
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,020
the organization has always believed
you're innocent.

298
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,340
But the process
still has to be followed.

299
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,740
Rest assured.

300
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,780
Everything

301
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,740
you used to have there

302
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,540
will stay the same.

303
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,060
I understand.

304
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
We're old now,

305
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,420
not some temperamental

306
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,300
college students.

307
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,020
Older comrades really think maturely.

308
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,940
But this matter

309
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,900
has really given us a wake-up call.

310
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,460
From now on,

311
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,380
in both work

312
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,500
and life,

313
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,060
we have to be careful.

314
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,620
A slight lapse

315
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,860
can give the enemy a chance.

316
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,420
This is also my fault

317
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,280
for not thinking it through.

318
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,500
But

319
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,780
it also exposed some problems.

320
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,980
Go ahead.

321
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,180
As the saying goes,

322
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,140
"Some people can only
be motivated by benefits."

323
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,260
You're just one of them,

324
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,100
right?

325
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,620
Let me finish.

326
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,660
Who am I?

327
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,980
I'm just a small fry, right?

328
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,020
Is it really worth

329
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,900
all this trouble

330
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,580
and careful planning?

331
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,380
Do you really think

332
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,180
this is just about me?

333
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,820
I'm glad you understand.

334
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,060
We're in the light,
and they're in the dark.

335
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,940
It's really hard to guard against.

336
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,180
But I have to remind you.

337
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,080
A wise man doesn't stand
under a dangerous wall.

338
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,660
Sometimes, some choices must be made.

339
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,100
What you're saying is nonsense.

340
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,060
We've tried every trick.

341
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,020
Don't you know
who's in charge of our family?

342
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,300
I know.

343
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,920
I've talked to Xuan on the phone.

344
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,900
I've given her a warning

345
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,260
about Tuan Island.

346
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,780
She's a smart person.

347
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,860
She should know what to do.

348
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,780
Alright, Tai Yongzheng.

349
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,420
No wonder you're the leader.

350
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,820
But from now on, stop calling her.

351
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,420
What's with all the phone calls?

352
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,100
Can you reason?

353
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,140
It was your wife who called me, okay?

354
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,060
You must've sent a message first.

355
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,900
Alright, alright.

356
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,100
Let me ask you.

357
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,020
What are you planning to do next?

358
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,420
Have you figured it out?

359
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,500
In my opinion,

360
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,740
all these things

361
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,060
are all aiming for one goal.

362
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,200
As long as we can open a gap,

363
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,940
all the problems will be resolved.

364
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,260
Who is the key?

365
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,340
The key is Chen Yiming.

366
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,860
As long as we can get him to talk,

367
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,780
we'll be able to see

368
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,540
the enemy hiding in the shadows.

369
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,620
(Outpatient and Emergency)

370
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,900
Bin.

371
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
What a coincidence.

372
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,100
Liu.

373
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,540
Well, my friend just had a baby.

374
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,000
I came to check on her.

375
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,900
Come on.

376
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,300
Chen and I have known each other
for a long time.

377
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,980
His wife had a baby.

378
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,340
I'm just here to see her.

379
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
It's normal, right?

380
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,700
Bin, the boss has instructed.

381
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,300
Unless Luo Jiahui agrees,

382
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,620
no one can see her.

383
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,140
- She has to agree?
- Right.

384
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,860
Let's go in and ask her.

385
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,620
She said on the first day

386
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,940
she wouldn't meet anyone
related to Bao Chenyan.

387
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,600
We're old friends, right?

388
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,380
I just need to ask her some questions.

389
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,120
I'll be out soon.
Please make an exception.

390
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,060
Liu,

391
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,740
when you first joined the police force,

392
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,220
who got you a desk and chair?

393
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,340
Now that I'm no longer there,

394
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,740
you don't even help me now?

395
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,340
Bin,

396
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,380
I really can't.

397
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,460
You...

398
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,220
Very dutiful.

399
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,940
Give her this for me then.

400
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,140
Alright.

401
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,180
You're back.

402
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,820
I remember someone saying

403
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,860
that he was well-respected
in the police force.

404
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,700
Turns out it was all just talk.

405
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,540
Bragging, huh?

406
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,880
Seriously,

407
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,060
I've noticed your colleagues
are hard to fool.

408
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,460
Except for that Fei Zai.

409
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,660
He's a bit brainless,

410
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,820
but I'd advise you to go easy on him.

411
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,940
(Medical Staff Only)
He will

412
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,400
get smarter if you keep fooling him.

413
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,020
Why the rush?

414
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,820
The show is just beginning.

415
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,940
The elevator just arrived.
Where are you going?

416
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,860
Where are you going?

417
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,580
I'm going to see the child.

418
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,820
You don't need
to check up on the child every day.

419
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,860
The child is in the ICU
with special care.

420
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,820
You should focus on recovering.

421
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,380
Take care of yourself first.

422
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,600
If you're really worried,

423
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,260
I can go see the child every day
for you.

424
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,620
No need, thank you.

425
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,740
You're Bin's friend, right?

426
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,320
- Yes.
- I'm looking for him.

427
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,340
Do you know where he is?

428
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,700
He seems to have gone over there.

429
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Over there, right?

430
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,460
I didn't bring my phone.

431
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,720
Can I borrow yours to call him?

432
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,360
- Can I borrow it?
- Luo Jiahui?

433
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,020
(Newborn Intensive Care Unit)

434
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,100
Hello?

435
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,140
Hello, Liu.

436
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Where are you?

437
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,820
I brought you some food.

438
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,260
Luo Jiahui is missing.

439
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,100
What?

440
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,340
Don't worry.

441
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,300
Tell me everything.

442
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,100
I went to see the child with Luo Jiahui.

443
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,860
Halfway there, Bin's friend stopped me

444
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,340
and asked where Bin went.

445
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,180
Bin?

446
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,500
Did he come to the hospital?

447
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,780
He came to see Luo Jiahui,
but I didn't let him in.

448
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,000
Well.

449
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,260
Don't tell Mr. Xing

450
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,580
about this just yet.

451
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,540
You know clearly what Chen Yiming

452
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,740
has done.

453
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,940
Who told him to do this? Tell me.

454
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,620
Open the door!

455
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,980
Officer!

456
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
He took my child!

457
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,860
My child!

458
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,580
Wen Binbin, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

459
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,940
Hurry up and return the child!

460
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,620
What child?

461
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
The child is in the ICU.

462
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,560
What do you want from me?

463
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,780
Take her away.

464
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,060
Let's go back to the ward.

465
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,380
(Newborn Intensive Care Unit)
Liu, take her back.

466
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,340
It's fine now?

467
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,740
Why were you so fierce just now?

468
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,140
I was just anxious.

469
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,140
So funny.

470
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,180
Hello?

471
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,860
I'll be back soon.

472
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,420
Your brother-in-law is fine now.

473
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,960
I'm going back to the station.

474
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,100
How do you know
he'll go back to the station first?

475
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,340
What if he goes home first?

476
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,460
I just know it.

477
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,060
If you don't believe me,

478
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,100
let's bet on a hotpot.

479
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,220
Anyway, if Xing Liang

480
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,940
dares to go back to the station
instead of home,

481
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,700
my sister will definitely get angry.

482
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,660
Our sister won't.

483
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,380
She's my sister.

484
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,880
Fine. Be careful later.

485
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,380
I'm not joking anymore. I'm leaving.

486
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,220
Come back.

487
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,580
I haven't finished talking.

488
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
Let me tell you.

489
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,900
After the fuss just now,

490
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,900
judging from her reaction,
I can be sure

491
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,740
Chen Yiming didn't tell the truth.

492
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,990
And Luo Jiahui

493
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,340
definitely knows something.

494
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,060
So what if she knows?

495
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,380
They're

496
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,500
a perfect couple.

497
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,980
Both of them refuse to talk.

498
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,340
We've interrogated

499
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,060
Chen Yiming so many times,

500
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,500
and he won't say anything.

501
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,980
As the old saying goes,

502
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,580
"Hit the snake at its weak point."

503
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,620
Since he's being so tough now,

504
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,780
just find something to scare him

505
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,620
to make him...

506
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,180
Scare him...

507
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,140
What do you mean?

508
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,100
Didn't you

509
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,180
break my watch once?

510
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,980
What were you most afraid of back then?

511
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,260
Why bring up something so old?

512
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,340
You were most afraid of seeing me.

513
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,600
Wait.

514
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,740
- Sis.
- Your brother-in-law is coming back.

515
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,980
Come home for dinner tonight.

516
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,060
I know.

517
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,540
It's no big deal.

518
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,500
Why get so worked up?

519
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,340
Alright, I got it.

520
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,900
I'll come back early.

521
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,060
Bin.

522
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,140
Think for yourself.

523
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,420
How is it, Xing?

524
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,740
No changes, right?

525
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,220
Yu and the others

526
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,060
always come here to clean up.

527
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,790
Look.

528
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,900
I'm almost a rare species now.

529
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
Mr. Xing.

530
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,620
What's going on?

531
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,820
Hold back your tears.

532
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,660
What's this all about?

533
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,820
Alright.

534
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,340
In half an hour,

535
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,460
let's have a meeting.

536
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,180
Let me see if you've been slacking off.

537
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,060
By the way,

538
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,580
you can get a good look at me.

539
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,620
Yes.

540
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,900
Go ahead.

541
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,940
Go get ready. Hurry.

542
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,700
Let's go.

543
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,620
How can you still focus on your phone?

544
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,860
I'm just checking the time.

545
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,880
Is Fei Zai reliable?

546
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,740
What time is it?
It's been almost 40 minutes.

547
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,740
- He hasn't been home.
- He'll be back soon.

548
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,100
Didn't you say he's out?

549
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,900
You made me cook dumplings so early.

550
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,420
Now they're almost cold.

551
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,660
Should I heat them up again?

552
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,060
He'll be here soon.

553
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,420
No need to change your shoes.

554
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,460
- I'm dirty.
- It's fine.

555
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,580
I'll wipe them later.

556
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,500
Let me see.

557
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,860
What happened?

558
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm fine.

559
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,260
Nothing. I'm fine.

560
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,980
I'm back, right?

561
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,780
- Quick.
- Stop being so lovey-dovey.

562
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,020
The dumplings are getting cold.

563
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,460
Sit down.

564
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,060
- Try it.
- You made the dumplings?

565
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,380
I made them myself.

566
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,100
- Alright.
- Try them.

567
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,660
Eat more. You've lost weight.

568
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,060
That's not true.

569
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
These past few days, I've just been

570
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,260
eating and sleeping in there.

571
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,220
I think

572
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,580
I've gained weight.

573
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,660
It's so good in there, huh?

574
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,760
Why did you even bother coming back?

575
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,160
It's because of you at home.

576
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,300
Enough already.

577
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,940
You're making my goosebumps rise.

578
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,620
It's rare for me
to hear some nice words.

579
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,740
What does it matter to you?

580
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,220
Bin,

581
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,860
I've heard about it.

582
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
This matter

583
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,020
got cleared up so quickly

584
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,100
thanks to you.

585
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,100
Thank you.

586
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
No need.

587
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,060
Everyone helped.

588
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,580
This modesty doesn't suit you.

589
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,180
Bin has matured.

590
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,660
Before,

591
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,900
I always treated him like a child.

592
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,780
I underestimated him.

593
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,420
Binbin has definitely grown up.

594
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,260
You two stop.

595
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,000
You two should pull my ear

596
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,260
and scold me just like before.

597
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,420
I'll feel more comfortable.

598
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,540
Why are you so annoying?

599
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,380
Can't you tell that we're being sincere?

600
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,860
Your brother-in-law and I

601
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,980
were too strict with you before,

602
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,140
but that was really for your own good.

603
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,140
Don't be mad at us.

604
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,560
What are you talking about, sis?

605
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,580
Since I was little,
you've always spoiled me.

606
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,780
You always let me have my way.

607
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,220
But I wasn't good enough,

608
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,140
always causing you trouble.

609
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,860
Liang,

610
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,960
it was my fault before.

611
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,260
I caused a lot of trouble for you.

612
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,500
Cheers to you.

613
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,340
I also made some mistakes.

614
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,580
Family doesn't need to be so polite.

615
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,220
It's settled then.

616
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,900
May everyone

617
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,740
in the family

618
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,060
be safe and sound in the future.

619
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,300
Alright.

620
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,380
Cheers.

621
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,620
Thank you for telling me
about my wife and kid.

622
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,340
Thank you.

623
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,420
I've already said
everything I needed to.

624
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,110
If you ask me again,

625
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,380
I'll still say the same things.

626
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,460
There's nothing more to say.

627
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,460
(Detention Area II)

628
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,540
Boss, boss.

629
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,860
I have an idea.

630
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,540
Didn't you

631
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,620
break my watch once?

632
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,860
(Newborn Intensive Care Unit)

633
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,420
What were you most afraid of back then?

634
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,700
Why bring up something so old?

635
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,780
You were most afraid of seeing me.

636
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,500
(Belongs Room, Interrogation Room 2)

637
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,380
Face the wall.

638
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,740
Face the wall.

639
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,420
Go inside.

640
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,780
Are you okay?

641
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,020
Are you alright?

642
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,540
What's wrong? Are you alright?

643
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,100
Does this need to be connected?

644
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,120
- Hello?
- I quit.

645
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,020
What?

646
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,220
How could this happen?

647
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,340
What exactly happened?

648
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,140
After he saw Bao Chenyan,

649
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,220
- his emotions...
- Wait.

650
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,500
Bao Chenyan?

651
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,460
Who allowed them to meet?

652
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,570
Mr. Xing,

653
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,970
this was my decision.

654
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,310
There hasn't been any new progress
with Chen Yiming,

655
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,740
so I thought maybe Bao Chenyan

656
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,820
could break through his defenses.

657
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,140
- Liu Yong.
- Mr. Xing.

658
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,820
I suggested it to Captain Liu.

659
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,820
Chen Yiming did this

660
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
when I was escorting him.

661
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,820
If you want to punish someone,
punish me alone.

662
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,940
Of course, I'll punish you.

663
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,180
I'll punish you alone.

664
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,580
What happened when they met?

665
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,340
They only looked from a distance.

666
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,380
They didn't talk.

667
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,220
I...

668
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,660
I didn't expect it.

669
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,620
Didn't expect it?

670
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,620
What did you expect?

671
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,380
You just want to get
what you want, right?

672
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,280
You didn't consider
any potential risks at all.

673
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,100
- Mr. Xing.
- Enough.

674
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,740
Handle the scene quickly.

675
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,740
I'm telling you.

676
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,220
Self-criticism reports for you two.

677
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,600
One year's bonus will be deducted.

678
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,500
The rest

679
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,460
depends on the bureau.

680
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,980
(Binbin)

681
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,140
You all go out.

682
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,100
After meeting you today,

683
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,760
Chen Yiming committed suicide.

684
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,390
Are you

685
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,230
suspecting me?

686
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,880
Chen Yiming's suicide

687
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,080
has something to do with you.

688
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,140
I'm saying

689
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,840
it's not you who wants him dead,

690
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,560
but for your sake,

691
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,140
he has to die.

692
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,990
I don't understand what you're saying.

693
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,450
When he was first brought in,

694
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,980
he didn't panic

695
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,030
like other suspects.

696
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,720
On the contrary,

697
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,310
he showed an unusual interest

698
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,680
in the Tuan Island bidding.

699
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,470
After learning the result
of the bidding,

700
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,320
he acted like a student

701
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,600
who knew the exam questions in advance.

702
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,740
Are you saying

703
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,800
he knew

704
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,260
the Tuan Island

705
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,860
bidding result in advance?

706
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,700
That's impossible.

707
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,380
Unless...

708
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,420
Unless he works for Qi Hanchen.

709
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,020
Every step he took

710
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,300
seemed to be carefully planned.

711
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,620
At the very beginning,

712
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,780
he refused to cooperate,

713
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,700
but later,

714
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,860
he admitted all the crimes.

715
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,100
But he kept avoiding mentioning

716
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,260
the mastermind behind it all

717
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,180
until you were arrested.

718
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,640
Then he insisted

719
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,980
you were the mastermind,

720
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,820
and he was just a coerced accomplice.

721
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,340
Of course,

722
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,980
everything he said

723
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,590
lacks solid evidence,

724
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,900
so it's hard to believe.

725
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,580
He clearly risked everything

726
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,100
to drag me down with him.

727
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,460
You police should handle cases
based on evidence.

728
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,580
After all that talk,

729
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
do you have evidence?

730
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,500
Bao Chenyan,

731
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,020
you're very familiar

732
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,160
with our police procedures.

733
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,220
But did you notice

734
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,300
today I didn't take a statement
from you?

735
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,220
So,

736
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,460
this is just a casual chat,

737
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,100
not a formal interrogation.

738
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,020
No need for evidence.

739
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,860
Right.

740
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,820
Let me correct your wording.

741
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,540
What I've said isn't a guess.

742
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,740
It's reasoning.

743
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,260
Fine, fine.

744
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,300
It's reasoning.

745
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,660
Then let me ask you.

746
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,980
Why did he want

747
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,460
to kill himself?

748
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
If

749
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,140
he hadn't committed suicide today,

750
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,680
I'd still find it hard to be sure

751
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,260
about my assumptions.

752
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,740
Actually,

753
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,740
he had predicted

754
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,140
your arrest.

755
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,620
And he was waiting for this moment

756
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,980
to identify you

757
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,780
and then commit suicide.

758
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,660
You mean

759
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,540
he was waiting

760
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,380
to meet me

761
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,420
and then die?

762
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,540
That doesn't make sense.

763
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,220
It doesn't make sense.

764
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,020
You know, my meeting with him today

765
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,220
was purely by chance.

766
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,500
He couldn't have foreseen it.

767
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,180
Are you saying he's an alien?

768
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,940
You're right.

769
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,420
He wouldn't know

770
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,340
when he'd meet you,

771
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,380
but what to do after meeting you

772
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,660
was all planned beforehand.

773
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,940
Someone wanted to use his life

774
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,060
to make the police believe

775
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,340
you, Bao Chenyan,

776
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,500
were the mastermind.

777
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,700
And

778
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,420
only after his death

779
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,940
could the real mastermind

780
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,180
remain safe.

781
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,300
Do you understand?

782
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,660
Big Eye Chen

783
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,820
has been my brother for years.

784
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,140
Every time there was a fight,

785
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,700
he fought hard.

786
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
I know

787
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,500
he just wanted to earn more money

788
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,980
to take care of his family.

789
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Let me tell you.

790
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,740
The person who's manipulating him

791
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,620
must've gotten to his weak spot.

792
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,360
You'd better check it out.

793
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,780
How are his wife and child now?

794
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,980
As his boss,

795
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,180
do you really not know

796
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,560
about Chen Yiming and Luo Jiahui?

797
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,340
How would I know whom he's dating?

798
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,500
Our brotherhood was based on feelings.

799
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,020
I've never tried to control his family.

800
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,180
Besides,

801
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,580
I'm not that manipulative.

802
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,020
He didn't want to talk,

803
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,220
and I never asked.

804
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,340
Yesterday,

805
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,880
I also thought about it for a long time.

806
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,740
The mastermind behind this

807
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,940
wants to screw me so bad.

808
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,380
It must be

809
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,760
because I've blocked their way.

810
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,980
Think about it.

811
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,860
Right now,

812
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,180
Qi Hanchen stands to gain the most

813
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,740
from my imprisonment, right?

814
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,460
He's in direct competition with you,

815
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,100
so logically,

816
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,500
he's the biggest suspect.

817
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,860
But,

818
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,020
if we piece everything together,

819
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,500
this trap

820
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,220
must've started the moment

821
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,220
Bin lost his gun.

822
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,020
At that time, Qi Hanchen

823
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,000
wasn't even involved
in the Tuan Island project.

824
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,620
So, to suspect him

825
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,300
is really too far-fetched.

826
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,060
You're right.

827
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,180
I've been thinking about it too.

828
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,900
I've been in the underworld

829
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,940
for years,

830
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,280
and I've made plenty of enemies,

831
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,580
but not many of them

832
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,300
are smarter than me.

833
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Could it be like this?

834
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,060
Dian Lao'er has always wanted

835
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,620
to snatch Tuan Island from me.

836
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,380
He knew

837
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,700
Bin and I were close,

838
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,220
so he wanted to destroy Bin's future.

839
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,540
That's why he took his gun.

840
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,020
He didn't finish the job

841
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,900
and teamed up with Qi Hanchen later.

842
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,140
The baton was passed to Qi Hanchen.

843
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,020
He kept going with the plan.

844
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,660
But Dian Lao'er is dead.

845
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,420
What you said can't be proven.

846
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,940
The Tuan Island project
is still up in the air,

847
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,140
so they must have more moves to make.

848
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,100
Xing Liang,

849
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,220
can you

850
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,380
let me out?

851
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,740
When will you release me?

852
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,820
You know Man and the others

853
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,380
are out there working their asses off.

854
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,660
I'm worried.

855
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,820
Why the hurry?

856
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,060
After our investigation is over,

857
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,260
we'll decide whether

858
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,500
you're released or not.

859
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,860
What's your attitude?

860
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,700
We're on good terms.

861
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,620
After so much talk just now,

862
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,020
you know I'm innocent,

863
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,340
so why are you locking me up?

864
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,780
Bao Chenyan,

865
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,780
I've already said it.

866
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,180
Today is just a casual chat,

867
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,900
not a formal interrogation.

868
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
Xing Liang!

869
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,180
