1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,160
Boss, we've

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,160
organized Lao'er's company files.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,770
Everything is fine

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,120
except that he only has

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,360
0.2 percent of shares.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,080
Try your best to get
at least two percent of shares

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,920
before the bid opening.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,160
It can't go wrong.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,640
Okay.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,480
However, will his death

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,720
affect the bid opening meeting?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,840
It certainly will.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,760
Therefore,

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,200
erase every trace of Dian Lao'er

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,040
from the Tuan Island project

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,760
as soon as possible.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,760
In that case,

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,240
there won't be a problem.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,520
What about Xing Liang?

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
Will he

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
hinder our plan?

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,720
Xing Liang is always a cautious man

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
with principle.

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,940
He won't affect

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,440
the final result.

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,760
Sometimes it's good for him

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,840
to want something.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,720
Now that we're going to join the game,

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,360
we should visit the referee.

30
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,460
=Black&White Forest=

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,460
=Episode 16=

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,320
Qi Hanchen and Dian Lao'er fell out.

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,760
Qi Hanchen was afraid

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,000
that Dian Lao'er might sell him out,

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
so he sent two people

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
to the nursing home

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,680
to find him by using

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,600
his father's phone

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
and kill him.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,600
I think

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,520
it makes sense.

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,560
We should get him over here.

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,400
When we blocked him at his company,

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,720
we should've got him to talk.

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,080
Do you think we can

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
get him to talk with this?

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
Besides, it might tip them off.

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
If we want to arrest An Zhihui,

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,800
we need solid evidence.

50
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,460
(It's modified.)

51
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,300
(Brembo caliper.)

52
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Mr. Xing,

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,950
an expert analyzed

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,880
the motorcycle's info.

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,280
You were right.

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,160
It's a modified motorcycle

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,480
with an unusual caliper.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Modified?

59
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,960
Modification is illegal.

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
Normally, they're underground stores.

61
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,270
It's hard to find it.

62
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,230
Don't worry.

63
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,840
I think Bin has made some progress.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
What do you mean?

65
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,600
Bin left in a hurry
after he took a picture

66
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,840
of the criminal's photo.

67
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,640
He must've been working on it.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
This work is tailored for him.

69
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,720
Wow, this guy...

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
He's keeping a low profile.

71
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
He wants to get credit.

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Let's wait and see.

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
I will teach him a lesson

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,680
when I see him next time.

75
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,480
Why next time?

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,880
You can teach him a lesson now.

77
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,120
Go. Teach him a lesson.

78
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
No problem!

79
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,080
There are so many motorcycles.

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,560
Officer,

81
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,680
how can I help you?

82
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,480
Nothing.

83
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,720
Recently,

84
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,480
many stores have been involved in

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,600
illegal modification.

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,360
We want to figure it out.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,840
Officer,

88
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,320
this is a legal store.

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,600
We wouldn't break the law.

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
I can tell.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,360
Your store is legal.

92
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,760
What do you think of this one?

93
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,480
Do you like it?

94
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,260
(Caution, Customers Stop)

95
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,960
The price is

96
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,920
negotiable.

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,760
Officer! Officer!

98
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
It's under construction.

99
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Officer, you can't get in.

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,690
There's nothing in there.

101
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,800
It's just a repair room.

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
Boss, I couldn't stop this officer.

103
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,760
Officer,

104
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,280
repair or modification?

105
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,560
Don't worry. I'll give you a discount.

106
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,360
Are you the owner?

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,680
Do you also work in the shop?

108
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,360
Just to make a living.

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,720
I don't need anything.

110
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Just take a look.

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
Suit yourself.

112
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,200
Wang, get some water.

113
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
No. No need.

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
- No need.
- It's okay.

115
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
Please don't.

116
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
Sorry for this.

117
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Walk him out.

118
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,760
Hurry.

119
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
You didn't find it?

120
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,560
Did you look carefully?

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
Why don't you see for yourself?

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
I've been working all morning.

123
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
How can you blame me?

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
What should we do?

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Ask someone to figure out

126
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,200
who his boss is.

127
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,730
I knew it. How can a boss

128
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,600
do hard labor here?

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,640
What if it's his hobby?

130
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,840
It's pretty normal for a rich guy
to work part-time

131
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,800
as a mechanic.

132
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,440
But it's weird that a motorcycle lover

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
rides this thing, isn't it?

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,710
Sorry, I had a long meeting.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Let's eat something.

136
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,760
You're not hungry?

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,240
Why are you

138
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
looking so serious?

139
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,080
Take a look.

140
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,220
(Share Transfer Agreement)

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
This...

142
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,960
Dian Lao'er wrote it.

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,160
It's the share

144
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
transfer agreement

145
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,840
of his company.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
He transferred all his shares

147
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,560
to me.

148
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,800
I didn't see that coming.

149
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,440
He only asked for one thing.

150
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Well, if I get

151
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
the Tuan Island project,

152
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,240
I'll give five percent of the dividend

153
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
to his father

154
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,360
and poor family every year.

155
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
It's like a free gift.

156
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
I know.

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
Aren't you rivals?

158
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,280
Yes, we are,

159
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,920
but compared to the person behind him,

160
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
I'm more adorable.

161
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,520
Bao means

162
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,200
we have another rival.

163
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Someone has been

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
supporting Dian Lao'er.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,480
I didn't know who it was,

166
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,280
but now I've figured it out.

167
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,960
Do you know who it is?

168
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,200
Qi Hanchen.

169
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
You're surprised.

170
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
He's very successful.

171
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,480
Why does he have to

172
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
meddle in the project?

173
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,400
I heard about him.

174
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,360
It's said he's a powerful man

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
with great connections

176
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,680
in

177
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,840
business and

178
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
political circles.

179
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,680
Qi Hanchen is indeed powerful.

180
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
However, no matter what,

181
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
at least

182
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
we should be scared of him.

183
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,040
Business is a game of power.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,800
We don't know what he's got,

185
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
but at least we have

186
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,040
this share transfer agreement.

187
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,480
Therefore, we still have a chance

188
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,760
to win.

189
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,880
I think

190
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
you're right.

191
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
We'll compete with him.

192
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,460
(Qi Hanchen, An Zhihui,
Uncle Long, Wu Ajin)

193
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,120
Dig into this.

194
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Liu Yong,

195
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,280
ask Fei Zai

196
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,960
to investigate Jiang Hu.

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,280
We might get some information.

198
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
- Okay.
- Go.

199
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,700
Hello.

200
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
Old friend, it's been a long time.

201
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
Come to Banshantang

202
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,640
for dinner at 7:00 p.m.

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,680
I can't. I'm busy.

204
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,720
Maybe next time.

205
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,560
I need to talk to you.

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,240
Can't you tell me on the phone?

207
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
What do you mean?

208
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm angry.

209
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,480
I've helped you a lot.

210
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,800
How can you reject me?

211
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
I...

212
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,480
(Jiang Hu)
I feel embarrassed.

213
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,620
I don't believe

214
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,040
you have no time for dinner.

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
Fine.

216
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,400
I'll come, okay?

217
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,030
I knew you'd come.

218
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Okay, 7:00 p.m.

219
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,580
See you there.

220
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,020
Don't be late, okay?

221
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,340
(Jiang Hu)

222
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Hu?

223
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
Who are you? What do you want?

224
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
Where's the motorbike?

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,340
Don't hit me!

226
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,800
Tell me.

227
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
Otherwise, no one can save you.

228
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,840
It's not in the store.

229
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,040
Someone took it away.

230
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,120
Where is it?

231
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,120
I don't know!

232
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,040
I'm not lying!

233
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,080
Chen suddenly asked someone
to take it away.

234
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,200
I was also surprised.

235
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,270
When did it happen?

236
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,320
This noon.

237
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,040
The police came right after that.

238
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,240
Listen, if you lie...

239
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
I wouldn't dare!

240
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
How did you get the scar?

241
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,880
It's not your fault.

242
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,160
I fell off my motorcycle by accident.

243
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,940
(Binjiang PSB)

244
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,920
(Location)
It showed up

245
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,840
at Wenhui Avenue.

246
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
The surveillance

247
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,440
didn't spot it in other locations.

248
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,760
Wait. Wait a minute.

249
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Boss,

250
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,160
I know this place.

251
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,120
I went there to hunt

252
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,960
a criminal.

253
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,720
There's a warehouse nearby

254
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,640
to hide things.

255
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,400
Mr. Xing.

256
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,000
I can check it out.

257
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,920
It's in there.

258
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,760
Send it to our boss.

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,840
Wait a minute.

260
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,840
If we do this, we'll tip them off.

261
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,600
Why?

262
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
The motorcycle is in there.

263
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,520
That's why we're here.

264
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,600
What motorcycle?

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,840
We want the person.

266
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
Hello, can you hurry up?

267
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
Hurry up.

268
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
You...

269
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh my god.

270
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,380
I'm only five minutes late. You...

271
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,280
Dear leader,

272
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,340
you're finally here.

273
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,320
Look, I thought you'd bail on me again.

274
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
It's a free dinner.
Why would I bail on you?

275
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
It happened a lot.

276
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,960
It's just the two of us. Why

277
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
is the room so big?

278
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,400
It's not just us.

279
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,520
Today, I'll introduce
an honored guest to you.

280
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Where are you going?

281
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,080
You know I hate socializing

282
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,120
the most.

283
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,440
Listen to me.

284
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,400
Nowadays,

285
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,320
hard work alone can't

286
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,160
lead to success,

287
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,030
right?

288
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,070
You need

289
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,240
to expand your circle
and make more friends.

290
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,160
- No, no.
- Expand your circle...

291
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,920
I... I prefer my small circle.

292
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,160
Mr. Li, sorry, I'm late.

293
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,280
No. You're not late.

294
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,640
We just arrived,

295
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,480
right?

296
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,640
Yes.

297
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,200
Let me introduce you.

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,720
This is my old classmate Xing Liang,

299
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,760
the captain of

300
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,320
Binjiang Crime Investigation Unit.

301
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,200
Liang,

302
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,040
this is

303
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,040
Mr. Qi.

304
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,760
Hello, Officer Xing.

305
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,720
Nice to meet you.

306
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,760
Don't stand here. Take a seat.

307
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,960
- Take a seat.
- Come on.

308
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Liang, listen,

309
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,920
Mr. Qi is

310
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,440
a very successful

311
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,520
young businessman.

312
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Come on. Take a seat.

313
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,200
Mr. Qi,

314
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,400
what business are you in?

315
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,600
I only do the business

316
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,720
that can make money.

317
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,620
Just kidding.

318
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,120
Mr. Qi, I'm not surprised.

319
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
That's brilliant.

320
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,870
Well said.

321
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,720
Everyone likes

322
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,880
that kind of business.

323
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm flattered.

324
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,720
No matter what,

325
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm just a businessman,

326
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,400
right?

327
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
However, Mr. Xing is

328
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,640
a people's policeman.

329
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,080
It's

330
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,160
so noble

331
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,960
and respectable.

332
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,200
I admire you.

333
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,120
Mr. Qi, I'm not bragging.

334
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
My old classmate

335
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,840
is worthy of his police uniform.

336
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,240
He's always

337
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,560
hard-working and responsible.

338
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,480
Enough.

339
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,430
Stop flattering me.

340
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm not. Can you let me finish?

341
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,960
He's too shy.

342
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,020
Mr. Qi, to be honest,

343
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,520
I really admire him.

344
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,120
However, he only cares about

345
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,680
his work.

346
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,520
Otherwise, with his ability,

347
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,880
he'd be much more successful.

348
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
I know.

349
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,760
Gold

350
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
is bound to glitter.

351
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,080
With Mr. Xing's ability,

352
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,680
he'll have a promising future.

353
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,880
Thank you.

354
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,000
Excuse me.

355
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I need to take this.

356
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,400
Hello.

357
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,240
I've arrived.

358
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,880
Hurry up.

359
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Okay.

360
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,720
Mr. Li.

361
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,400
I also invited a friend here.

362
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,600
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

363
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
More people, more fun.

364
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,320
I think Mr. Xing

365
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,560
knows my friend very well.

366
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,360
Hey, I'm here.

367
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,520
You're here.

368
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,840
Tai?

369
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
- You...
- Why are you here?

370
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,320
You're late.

371
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,240
Drink.

372
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,400
Drink what?

373
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,120
I can't drink during work hours.

374
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,280
You know that.

375
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,400
You're doing it again.

376
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,000
Mr. Tai, right?

377
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,760
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

378
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,760
Take a seat.

379
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,140
- Okay.
- Come on.

380
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
- Come on.
- Here.

381
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,560
Let's make it clear.

382
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,730
Friends reunion.

383
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,000
Daily matters only.

384
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,480
Look.

385
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,640
It's like I'm asking you for a favor.

386
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,560
- Mr. Tai.
- Thanks.

387
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,480
I'm Xing Liang's classmate

388
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
in middle school.

389
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm also his classmate.

390
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,640
In college.

391
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,080
Really?

392
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,920
What a coincidence.

393
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,960
Mr. Tai,

394
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,680
Xing Liang talked about you a lot.

395
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,360
He said you often took care of him.

396
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
It's not like that.

397
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,880
I just came to Binjiang.

398
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,080
To be honest,

399
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
he's the one

400
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,520
who's been helping me.

401
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,000
Actually,

402
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,080
I'm also new here.

403
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,480
Mr. Xing,

404
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,360
can you take care of me too?

405
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,760
Oh. Ask him.

406
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
He's my leader.

407
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
He's asking you. Don't get me into this.

408
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,040
Mr. Xing, you're too polite.

409
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,640
Since you came here in 2006,

410
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,920
you've become

411
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
a unit chief

412
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,240
from a captain.

413
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,240
It's fair to say that Binjiang

414
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,320
is your territory.

415
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,900
(Xingyu Pier)

416
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,860
(Memorial)

417
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:31,340
(You will be remembered.)

418
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,840
You have to take this.

419
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,600
You'll have

420
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,160
a lot of money in the underworld.

421
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
You can

422
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
buy some wine.

423
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,400
Don't

424
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
smoke too much.

425
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,980
(Memorial)

426
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,280
Dian Lao'er had so many men.

427
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
None of them showed up.

428
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,040
Dian Lao'er

429
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,240
was like a cunning monkey.

430
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,480
Maybe he never had a heart.

431
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,680
He'd deceive anyone.

432
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,960
The people around him

433
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,760
are also cunning.

434
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,320
They know him well.

435
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,280
He wanted to

436
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,240
take advantage of them.

437
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,880
Who'd be loyal to him?

438
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,720
There is a loyal man.

439
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,480
Uncle Hai

440
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,480
was almost beaten to death by his enemy.

441
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,360
When his daughter had a fever,

442
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
he needed money,

443
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,000
and Lao'er offered him a job
to make a living.

444
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,680
I didn't know Dian Lao'er
did such a good thing.

445
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,840
Maybe he was blessed by his ancestors.

446
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,760
Somehow,

447
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,360
he did something good

448
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,960
without thinking for himself.

449
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,920
Now someone can collect his body.

450
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,780
(Memorial)

451
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,120
Speaking of which,

452
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,880
the Wen Family and my family

453
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,560
are old friends.

454
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,760
Therefore,

455
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,200
I heard about Ms. Wen's husband

456
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,120
a long time ago.

457
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,800
Didn't Sister Xuan

458
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
tell you about me?

459
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,280
I can't believe

460
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,880
you know each other so well.

461
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,240
When I started my business,

462
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,630
Mr. Wen

463
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,840
helped me a lot.

464
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
Speaking of business,

465
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,320
the Wens

466
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,680
are born for this.

467
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,990
Mr. Wen was a successful businessman,

468
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and now Sister Xuan

469
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,680
is passing on

470
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,200
his honor.

471
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,240
You're right about this.

472
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
Xuan is

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,480
a successful woman.

474
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,960
Sometimes she's better than men.

475
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,520
Yes.

476
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,280
Mr. Tai is right.

477
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,280
She's better than me.

478
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,320
The Wen Family has all kinds of

479
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,640
businesses

480
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,040
all over the country.

481
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,880
It must be hard for Sister Xuan

482
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,640
to deal with it alone.

483
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
Mr. Xing.

484
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,880
Somehow, I heard

485
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,880
the Wen Family

486
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,600
has been having some

487
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,880
money problems lately.

488
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,480
If you need anything,

489
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,520
please tell me.

490
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,040
That'd be wonderful.

491
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,240
However,

492
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,480
I know nothing

493
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,040
about business.

494
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
It makes sense.

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,080
Sister Xuan

496
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,080
is doing well in business.

497
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,120
You don't need to worry about her.

498
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,920
Mr. Qi, can I

499
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,480
ask you a question?

500
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,480
Why did you choose

501
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,680
to come here?

502
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,240
I've been quite interested in

503
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,240
a project in Binjiang.

504
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,850
Mr. Qi, the project you're interested in

505
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,080
must be profitable.

506
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Tuan Island?

507
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,360
Mr. Li, you're so clever.

508
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,960
Do you think

509
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,500
it's possible for me

510
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,240
to get the project?

511
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,040
With your ability

512
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,080
and the help of

513
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,620
the outstanding entrepreneur Ms. Wen,

514
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
you will get it.

515
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,880
Mr. Xing,

516
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,720
actually, I've always wanted

517
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
to cooperate with the Wen Family

518
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,040
in business.

519
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,320
I think the Tuan Island project

520
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,800
is a great opportunity.

521
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
Mr. Qi, I'd like to remind you

522
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,440
the Tuan Island project

523
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
seems to be quite complicated.

524
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,280
It's not a problem.

525
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,720
I've got a basic understanding

526
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920
of this project.

527
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,800
From now on, I'm going to

528
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,880
get fully involved.

529
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,000
It seems you're very persistent.

530
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,600
He's going to be great.

531
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,520
Mr. Tai knows me well.

532
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,240
My life motto is

533
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,720
be great

534
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,560
or nothing.

535
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,320
Well said.

536
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,640
(Xingyu Haiyu)

537
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,280
I didn't expect

538
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,840
you'd be the only one

539
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,640
to

540
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,960
visit

541
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,320
Dian Lao'er.

542
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,600
Hai,

543
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,920
everyone gives a shove
to a falling wall.

544
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,880
It's how the world works.

545
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,480
You want to wash the dirt

546
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,040
off your body.

547
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
But no matter how hard you try,

548
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,680
they still think you're dirty.

549
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't know

550
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,360
how many people will visit me

551
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,440
when I'm gone.

552
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,760
You're different.

553
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,480
You figured it out early on.

554
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,360
However,

555
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,040
he hadn't figured it out

556
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,680
until the day he died.

557
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,600
It was too late.

558
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,200
No turning back.

559
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Bao,

560
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
thank you for coming.

561
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,720
Dian Lao'er would be

562
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,960
so glad.

563
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,160
We won't see each other anymore.

564
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,440
I'd like to thank you

565
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,280
on behalf of

566
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
my family.

567
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,160
Fine.

568
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,010
Did you

569
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,720
have a bad day at work?

570
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,920
I met someone.

571
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,080
So annoying.

572
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
Aren't you curious?

573
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,950
I'm not supposed to

574
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,600
ask about your work, right?

575
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,920
You would've told me

576
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,860
if you wanted to.

577
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,710
Qi Hanchen.

578
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Sister Xuan?

579
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,040
That's what he called you.

580
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,480
We've been married for years,

581
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,640
and I can't even say
something so cheesy.

582
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,800
What did you call him?

583
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,720
Brother Hanchen?

584
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
When we were young,

585
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,520
we always called each other

586
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,240
sister or brother, right?

587
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,040
What else could I call him?

588
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,120
Look at you.

589
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,040
Seriously?

590
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,320
Why are you

591
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,720
so jealous of him?

592
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,040
Well,

593
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,160
did he and you...?

594
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes.

595
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,080
He pursued me, but I didn't say yes.

596
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,640
He hasn't moved on.

597
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,680
You're so jealous.

598
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,840
I haven't seen him for years.

599
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,320
You'll

600
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,440
see him often.

601
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,600
He's in Binjiang,

602
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,960
and

603
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
he's also bidding for Tuan Island.

604
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,760
You know it, right?

605
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,760
Listen,

606
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,160
your Brother Hanchen

607
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,720
wants to cooperate with you.

608
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,840
Are you happy?

609
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
My opinion matters too.

610
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't want to cooperate with him.

611
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,520
You don't know him well enough.

612
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,480
You think he

613
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,520
looks like

614
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,720
a modest person, right?

615
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
If you know him well,

616
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,680
you'll find he's...

617
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,320
At least for me,

618
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,240
he's

619
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
an arrogant

620
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
narcissist,

621
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,800
and I don't like that.

622
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,320
Really?

623
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,880
Of course.

624
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,720
If you don't like it,

625
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,840
stay away from him.

626
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,880
Okay, okay.

627
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,120
You're jealous.

628
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,840
Who's jealous?

629
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,120
I just don't want you to do anything
against your will.

630
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,960
I won't.

631
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
Don't worry.

632
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,920
However,

633
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,080
I've heard he's very capable.

634
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,240
Do you think you can win?

635
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,640
Bao and I have got more than

636
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,200
50 percent of the shares.

637
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,160
We'll get it.

638
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,600
Okay.

639
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,920
Wait.

640
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,840
How did you

641
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,360
get so many shares?

642
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,640
Dian Lao'er transferred all his shares

643
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,480
to Bao.

644
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,880
When did that happen?

645
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,520
Right before

646
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,360
Dian Lao'er

647
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,680
was killed.

648
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,120
I knew he lied to me!

649
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,200
Well, how could Bao know

650
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,120
it was a share

651
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,720
transfer agreement?

652
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,080
Just keep doing this.

653
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,080
Something will go wrong.

654
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,320
Something big!

655
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,360
What's wrong with you?

656
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,760
Are you jealous

657
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,240
or mad?

658
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,760
Both!

659
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,120
What a psycho.

660
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,360
Back then,

661
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,680
when we worked for Lao'er,

662
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,520
Mouse Zhou...

663
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,400
He was a nobody!

664
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,200
Isn't that Xizai and his bros?

665
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,400
How did they end up

666
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,280
like this?

667
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,520
Stop.

668
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,760
Stop now.

669
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,880
For what?

670
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,280
Zai,

671
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,720
among Lao'er's brothers,

672
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,840
I think you're the best one.

673
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,840
I've wanted to drink with you.

674
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,680
Come on.

675
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,880
I'll finish this first.

676
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,280
Here's to you, Zai.

677
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,360
Since Lao'er passed away,

678
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
your area has been a mess.

679
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,120
Why didn't your new boss Shuigui
deal with it?

680
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,480
New boss?

681
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,120
You don't know?

682
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,640
A lot of things

683
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,360
happened when you were in hospital.

684
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,640
I heard

685
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,880
Lao'er handed over

686
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,640
his business to Shuigui.

687
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,400
Isn't Shuigui the new boss?

688
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,320
No way.

689
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
It's impossible.

690
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,240
If you don't believe it, just ask him.

691
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,440
Ask him

692
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,480
where this contract is.

693
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,320
If he tells you he doesn't know,

694
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,960
something must be wrong.

695
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,440
Lao'er even

696
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,840
showed the contract to Bao.

697
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Zai.

698
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,880
Do you still think he's a good guy?

699
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,640
Forget about it.

700
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,000
We understand

701
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,520
why you didn't go to the funeral.

702
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,600
You were in hospital.

703
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,280
He was doing fine,

704
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,400
but he didn't show up.

705
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,480
How can you explain that?

706
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,880
Ungrateful traitor!

707
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,840
I'm going to kill him!

708
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,880
Zai, don't be angry.

709
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,720
Look,

710
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,400
his nickname is Shuigui

711
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,480
because he's cunning.

712
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,040
One more thing.

713
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,320
He got all the benefits, right?

714
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,880
Shuigui's men told Bao they wanted

715
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,600
to cooperate with him.

716
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,120
Yes.

717
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,040
What did Bao say?

718
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,920
How could he agree to that?

719
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,240
He just ignored him.

720
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,280
However, Zai,

721
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,720
Lao'er's legacy can't be wasted

722
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,560
like this.

723
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,400
Someone has to be in charge.

724
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,280
I think it's a good opportunity.

725
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,320
What has Shuigui got?

726
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,040
He can only say nice things

727
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,120
to please Lao'er.

728
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,840
It doesn't work for gangsters.

729
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,600
After all, it's a violent game.

730
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,200
In this regard,

731
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,180
he's no match for you.

732
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,920
Anyway, if you want to defeat him,

733
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,320
I have an idea,

734
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,160
but

735
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,880
I'm not sure if you want to listen.

736
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,200
Tell me what it is.

737
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Okay, I'll tell you.

738
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
Lao'er

739
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
was assassinated.

740
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
If you can do something

741
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
about it,

742
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,880
you'll be a loyal man
who avenges his death.

743
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,680
In that case, they'll all

744
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,960
listen to you.

745
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,480
Let's just talk about

746
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,560
Uncle Hai.

747
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,440
He's the most loyal man.

748
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,320
If he supports you,

749
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,640
you'll get everyone's support,

750
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,720
and it'll be so easy

751
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,720
to defeat Shuigui.

752
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,240
It's a good idea,

753
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
but where can I find the person?

754
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,040
I know a motorcycle lover.

755
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,400
The other day, he sent me a picture

756
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,800
of a motorcycle in the eastern suburbs.

757
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,920
It's similar to the suspect's motorcycle

758
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
the police posted.

759
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,140
I'll send it to you.

760
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,160
Really?

761
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,720
You can start from there.

762
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,480
Let's eat.

763
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,720
Bro, it's on me.

764
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,200
Well...

765
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
Just eat. I'll pay.

766
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,580
Zai, goodbye.

767
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,120
Eat something.

768
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,000
You're so good at lying.

769
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,280
You're the biggest liar in the world.

770
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,720
Uncle Hai.

771
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,600
When I think of Lao'er,

772
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
I feel so sad.

773
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,440
If I was there,

774
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,920
I'd risk my life

775
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,600
to protect him.

776
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,800
It's my fault.

777
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,880
Enough.

778
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,160
It's in the past.

779
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,000
Don't be too hard on yourself.

780
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,360
Zai.

781
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,920
We didn't find him

782
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,840
on Dongxing Street.

783
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,040
Expand the search area.

784
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,760
Uncle Hai,

785
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,920
I don't know about others,

786
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,360
but I'll always remember
how Lao'er treated me.

787
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,360
As long as I'm alive,

788
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,880
I'll find that person.

789
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,640
Zai,

790
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,480
we checked it.

791
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,520
He's not the suspect.

792
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,560
Then keep looking!

793
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,880
Clean the wound with iodine.

794
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,680
Don't get infected.

795
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,160
Thanks, Uncle Hai.

796
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,040
He took the bait.

797
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,120
They're all looking for him.

798
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,760
He doesn't want anyone
to find the motorcycle.

799
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,620
I knew he'd take the bait.

800
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,940
(Surveillance, Warehouse Gate)

801
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,190
Mr. Xing.

802
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,520
Team II, stand down

803
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,760
and stay alert.

804
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,160
The rest of you,

805
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,680
move.

806
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,080
Police, don't move! Get off!

807
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,120
Don't move!

808
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,000
Get off!

809
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,160
- What's going on?
- Don't move!

810
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,120
What's happening?

811
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,920
Take him.

812
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,800
It's over?

813
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,920
He fooled us.

814
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,190
Officer,

815
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm just a junk man.

816
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,680
It's not my motorcycle.

817
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,000
Who sent you?

818
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,640
Someone paid me

819
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,290
to scrap a motorcycle.

820
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,130
He asked me

821
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,500
to come here and drive it away.

822
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,480
How did he contact you?

823
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,600
The other day...

824
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,020
(Yongshun Junkyard)

825
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,880
Who's this?

826
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,920
What do you need?

827
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,680
I have a motorcycle.

828
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,900
Can you scrap it for me?

829
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,480
Well,

830
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,380
want to sell it?

831
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,800
No.

832
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,400
Just use your tools

833
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,560
to scrap it.

834
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,440
Accident?

835
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,520
It was not serious.

836
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,840
I cleaned it up.

837
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,000
Can you do it?

838
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,200
Answer me now.

839
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,400
I'm taking a risk.

840
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,200
I need more.

841
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,680
It's the deposit.

842
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,000
When this is over,

843
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,610
I'll give you the other half.

844
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,480
It's in the warehouse

845
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,070
in the backstreet of Wenhui Avenue.

846
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,760
You need to take it back tomorrow.

847
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,880
This...

848
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,880
Don't be scared.

849
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,160
You have the key.

850
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,080
One more day, okay?

851
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,480
I have an appointment to get

852
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,320
some stuff tomorrow.

853
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,840
I have no time.

854
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,600
If you can't do it,

855
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,550
I'll ask someone else.

856
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,040
Okay.

857
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,400
How can I contact you?

858
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,640
(Yongshun, Wang Dali)
I'll call you.

859
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,240
Just get your work done

860
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,720
and wait for the money.

861
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,980
(Yongshun Junkyard)

862
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,360
I've dealt with

863
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,080
accident vehicles before.

864
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,680
Nothing has happened.

865
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,520
Who'd have thought

866
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,680
it'd be a hot potato?

867
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,840
If I'd known this,

868
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,160
I wouldn't have agreed.

869
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,760
You don't even have his contact info.

870
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,480
Why if he doesn't pay the rest?

871
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,360
To be honest,

872
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,440
all these vehicles

873
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,820
are illegal.

874
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,290
No one would take a risk for

875
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,210
that amount of money.

876
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,240
Besides,

877
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,590
if he doesn't pay,

878
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,700
I'll report it to the police.

879
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,750
Enough.

880
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,100
He said he'd call you.

881
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,460
We'll wait.

882
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,420
Why is he in a hurry

883
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,820
to get rid of it today?

884
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,180
Bin persuaded Lao'er's men

885
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,300
to look for the motorcycle by accident.

886
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,540
He couldn't have known it.

887
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,660
Liu Yong.

888
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,460
Go back to the car.

889
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,280
Okay.

890
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,660
Where are we going?

891
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
Nowhere.

892
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,580
Look at them.

893
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,170
They must've found something.

894
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,080
Follow them.

895
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,540
Mr. Xing.

896

He's calling.

897
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,020
Do you remember what I told you?

898
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,100
- Yes.
- Okay.

899
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,380
Hello, who's this?

900
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,140
How's it going with my motorcycle?

901
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,860
Just got it. I'm going back.

902
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,720
So slow.

903
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,660
You have to get rid of it tonight.

904
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,600
I will

905
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,020
take care of it.

906
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,300
The problem is

907
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,180
when and how I can

908
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,030
get the money.

909
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,980
When you're done,

910
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,360
you will get the money.

911
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,860
Sir, how about this?

912
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,120
I'll add you on WeChat,

913
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:22,970
and you...

914
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,900
How's it going?

915
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,710
It was too short.

916
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,880
Only a rough location.

917
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,420
The base station on 5th Street.

918
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,220
5th Street?

919
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,940
My junkyard is there.

920
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,060
He's spying on us?

921
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,460
Listen.

922
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,700
We're going there.

923
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,900
We need your help.

(Yongshun Junkyard)

925
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
What should I do?

926
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,780
Don't scrap it now.

927
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,500
Get back to work.

928
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,500
Stay calm.

929
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,700
Okay.

930
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,300
Mr. Xing.

931
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,700
It's an open area.

932
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,660
There aren't

933

many high spots with a direct view
of the junkyard.

Considering the effect range

935

of the base station,

936
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,830
only three buildings

937
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,360
are qualified.

938
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,580
(Surveillance, Junkyard)
We need more info

939
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,100
to locate him.

940
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,940
Liu Yong.

941
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,980
I'll contact the SWAT.

942
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,180
Take your men to block the road.

943
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,380
When we're ready,

944
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,380
go in and arrest him.

945
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
- Okay.
- Go.
