1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,420
(13 Years Ago)

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,580
(Younger Wen Binbin)

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,160
Brother!

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,580
(Wild Jiang, Binjiang Gang Leader)

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,440
Two million yuan

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,000
and the contract.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,360
As you requested,

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,080
I'll give you 10% of
the management fee for the market.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,320
Let him go.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,520
Is that an order?

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,120
I'm asking you.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Is that an order?

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,720
Don't touch him.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,960
Or what?

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,000
Your family is so powerful.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,360
It seems you have money to burn.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,520
You need to play by the rules.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,840
Useless driver,

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,720
why do I need to follow your rule?

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,680
Mr. Wen and you had a deal
about the money.

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,560
I've brought the money.

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,680
Cash on delivery.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
You can't break the rule.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,400
Then why did you

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,640
break the rule

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,270
when you called the police?

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,480
It's normal to call the police.

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,720
Who'd have thought they'd come?

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
You can

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,200
take him back.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,040
However, I don't like you.

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,680
What should I do?

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,760
Wash your dirty mouth.

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,280
Is it too much?

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,840
That's right.

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
Pour it out a little.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Don't hurt him!

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,440
I'll drink.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,880
It's too much.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
I'll drink!

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Brother!

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
What a waste.

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,920
Brother, help!

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760
Brother!

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,500
=Black&White Forest=

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,460
=Episode 6=

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
Okay.

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Okay,

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,920
I got it.

50
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
If something happens,

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,600
report to me immediately.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Okay.

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
Boss.

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
Can I ask you something?

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,480
If they find out someone

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,200
did set me up for losing the gun,

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,240
will I be able to go back to work

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,760
when this is over?

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,200
Is that what you think?

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
Considering your attitude to me,

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,600
I thought you didn't care.

62
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
No way.

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,360
I said it

64
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,400
because I thought it was hopeless.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,080
If there's any hope,

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
I'll definitely...

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Boss.

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,880
I'll be honest with you.

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
I didn't step forward

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,000
when visiting my father's grave.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
I wouldn't dare face him.

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
It was his death wish,

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,920
but I screwed up.

74
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,120
I...

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,400
I'm so...

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
You're responsible for losing the gun.

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,440
Yes.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
If you can

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,760
find out the truth

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,560
and make contributions,

81
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,760
we can adjust your punishment

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
based on the situation.

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
Bin.

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,080
As Mr. Tai said,

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,480
you're suspended

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
now,

87
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
but you're still a cop,

88
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,600
and you need to fulfill your duty.

89
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,870
Seize the opportunity in Tuan Island.

90
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,320
You can't

91
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,160
let us down.

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,070
I've done a great job
over the past two months, right?

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,360
I tried so hard to investigate it

94
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
and look for the shooter.

95
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,760
I spent my money.

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,720
I paid for...

97
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
If you think it's not worth it,

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,000
you can stay out of it.

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,160
Liang, Liang.

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
Stop. It hurts.

101
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Well,

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,920
what were you talking

103
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,120
about on the phone?

104
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,360
We got information from Ninghai.

105
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,200
According to

106
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,670
the criminals'

107
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,240
fingerprints they've kept,

108
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,800
it's clear

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
that the suspect

110
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
is Sun Changhai,
originally named Sun Hao.

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,320
He's in Binjiang.

112
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,200
He flew to

113
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,880
Beichun this afternoon.

114
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,040
What are we waiting for?

115
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,400
Let's go to Ninghai.

116
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,360
Wait.

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Why are you so excited?

118
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,280
Know your place.

119
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,560
The police will go there.

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,320
This is not an investigation

121
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,360
but an arrest,

122
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
understand?

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,400
You know nothing

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
about Ninghai, right?

125
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,880
Why are you so excited?

126
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
Are you sure

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,080
you're going?

128
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Yes.

129
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
Stay at home!

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,920
Don't go anywhere!

131
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
Think about it.

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
You've been to Ninghai

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
four times.

134
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,600
The last time was seven years ago!

135
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Why are you going there?

136
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,360
What do you mean?

137
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm saying

138
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,880
don't go.

139
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll take care of it.

140
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,600
No way.

141
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,880
You can only make it worse,

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
understand?

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you understand?

144
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,520
Anyway, here's my word.

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,120
Whether you like it or not,

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,640
I'll go there.

147
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
Okay. Here's my word.

148
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
Listen, you're not going anywhere,

149
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,760
okay?

150
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,960
Tianyi.

151
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,720
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
out of your sight!

153
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,120
Listen,

154
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,880
you can go anywhere

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,000
in the world

156
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,280
except for Ninghai!

157
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
Do you understand?

158
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,720
What is that?

159
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,200
He's your bro, isn't he?

160
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,880
Aren't you worried about him?

161
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,240
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

162
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
I... I'll keep a close eye on him.

163
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,720
It's unlawful detention!

164
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,760
Yes, it is.

165
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
So what?

166
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,640
Bin.

167
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,280
Don't be mad at Bao.

168
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Bao is doing this for you.

169
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,160
There's something I haven't told you.

170
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,240
When you joined us,

171
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,360
Bao told me...

172
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
He said...

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,120
"Tianyi,

174
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,960
take care of Binbin.

175
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,080
If there's

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
a scar on his body,

177
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,520
I'll give you two scars.

178
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,800
If there's a hole in his body,

179
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,320
I'll shoot three holes in your body."

180
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,320
Therefore,

181
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,080
Bao is always prioritizing

182
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,840
your safety.

183
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,960
Besides,

184
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,800
what's the point

185
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,040
of going to Ninghai?

186
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,400
There's

187
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,280
nothing you can do, right?

188
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,680
Don't you know the situation in Ninghai?

189
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,000
It's dangerous.

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Think about Er'leng and Wu.

191
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
They're big and strong.

192
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,960
You're thin and fragile.

193
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,200
You'll get yourself killed, okay?

194
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,520
Say something.

195
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,280
You're right.

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
But I have to go.

197
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,320
Why are you so stubborn?

198
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,110
Aren't you happy with us?

199
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,360
What do you want?

200
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
I want peace of mind.

201
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,520
Since I was little,

202
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,360
I've never

203
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,880
taken anything seriously.

204
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,760
My only aspiration

205
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,800
is to become a policeman.

206
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,640
Before my dad died,

207
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
he only told me one thing

208
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,040
in front of

209
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,100
my mom, my sister,

210
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,560
Bao, and the annoying

211
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,960
brother-in-law.

212
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,880
Be a policeman.

213
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
It was the only thing he expected of me.

214
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,680
I had to do it.

215
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
So, I worked hard

216
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
to get into the police academy.

217
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,000
When I took the acceptance letter
to his grave

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,040
and burned paper money,

219
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,480
the flame was so strong.

220
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,520
I knew he was happy.

221
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
I was never a good son.

222
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,520
I made a lot of trouble

223
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,480
for him.

224
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
And I finally made

225
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,320
him happy.

226
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,800
Unfortunately,

227
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,680
two years later,

228
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,960
I made a big mistake

229
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,880
and was suspended.

230
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,040
I can't face him anymore.

231
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
If you were me,

232
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
would you give up the chance

233
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,860
and do nothing about it?

234
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,880
If I miss the chance,

235
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,700
how am I supposed to face him?

236
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,180
Tianyi.

237
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,100
Do you think

238
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,060
anyone will feel sad for me

239
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,180
if I hit my head and die

240
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,540
in front of his grave?

241
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,100
I'll be there

242
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
at dusk.

243
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,180
Let's have dinner together.

244
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,180
Goodbye.

245
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,900
Man.

246
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,780
I have to

247
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,820
go to Ninghai.

248
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,220
Take care of the company.

249
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,900
Ninghai?

250
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,180
Hello, Wu.

251
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,820
What's wrong?

252
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,860
Bao,

253
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,860
last night, Shuigui and his men

254
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,140
made a scene in Ping's house,

255
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,980
and we kicked them out.

256
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,820
The police just came

257
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,660
and took Er'leng away.

258
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,220
Someone accused him

259
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,340
of causing minor injuries.

260
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,420
You're so brave, aren't you?

261
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,380
Wu, don't go back

262
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,740
to the office for a few days.

263
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,980
You can

264
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,860
take a break.

265
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,700
Okay.

266
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,220
What happened?

267
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,610
Bao.

268
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,340
I know Ninghai's issue
is important to you,

269
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,940
but I think

270
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,020
Tuan Island is our foundation.

271
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,980
Well, Dian Lao'er

272
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,500
has been coveting Tuan Island.

273
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,980
He's played

274
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,140
many tricks.

275
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,580
I don't think

276
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,780
he's

277
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,060
doing this for fun.

278
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,700
Bao.

279
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,100
Tuan Island needs you.

280
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,540
We can't afford to lose it.

281
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,220
Hello.

282
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,700
Hello, Bao.

283
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,060
Well, I'm calling to tell you

284
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,700
Tianyi and I have boarded the plane.

285
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,020
You... Boarded the plane?

286
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,580
Get off the plane now!

287
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,420
Hurry up!

288
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,900
It's taking off. I have to go.

289
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,740
Goodbye.

290
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,780
Well...

291
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,900
What did he say?

292
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,820
Anyway, I already told him.

293
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,500
What? Listen...

294
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,780
Let's go.

295
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,180
(Domestic Departure)

296
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
What's wrong?

297
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,340
I told Tianyi

298
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
to keep an eye on

299
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,580
Binbin,

300
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,180
but...

301
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,380
Binbin turned him,

302
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,020
and they're going to Ninghai.

303
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,950
How could they do this?

304
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,820
Dian Lao'er.

305
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,940
Hello.

306
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,020
Dian Lao'er.

307
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,900
Have you no shame?

308
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,620
How could you do that?

309
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,060
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

310
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,860
Am I wrong?

311
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,020
I wanted to buy the shares legally,

312
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,620
but your men beat us

313
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,660
for no reason.

314
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,780
I'm not even asking for moral damages.

315
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,900
Who has no shame?

316
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,620
Legally? Are you serious?

317
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,580
Look at you.

318
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,860
You called the police!

319
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,780
My brother was arrested!

320
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,020
Do you think I've been too good to you?

321
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,380
Do you want a lesson?

322
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,540
So what?

323
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,700
Do you think I'm scared?

324
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,140
We didn't fight last time.

325
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,300
Do you want

326
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,540
to have a fight?

327
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,500
No problem.

328
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,060
Let's fight. You decide

329
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,500
the time and place, okay?

330
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,900
Stop dreaming.

331
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,660
You'll call the police.

332
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
How about this?

333
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,420
Let's play

334
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
a civilized game.

335
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,900
Let's play with money.

336
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,740
What?

337
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,820
Are you kidding me?

338
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,660
Dian Lao'er.

339
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,860
Money?

340
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,260
Do you have money?

341
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,460
Don't think

342
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,580
you can compete with me

343
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
with the money you made

344
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,020
by selling fish.

345
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,860
Look,

346
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,940
are you crazy

347
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,060
or pretending to be crazy?

348
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,500
None of your business.

349
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,820
You want Tuan Island's project,

350
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,860
and I want it too.

351
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,460
Let's play fair,

352
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,540
okay?

353
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,900
Whoever plays dirty

354
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,100
will be the underdog.

355
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,060
No problem!

356
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,540
It's a deal!

357
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,300
I'll play with you!

358
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,660
If you back out,

359
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,540
you'll call me great-grandfather.

360
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,100
Bao.

361
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,440
Why do I feel

362
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,980
something's wrong

363
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,180
with him this time?

364
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,860
He's just an idiot!

365
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,100
What can go wrong?

366
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,220
Don't you know

367
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,460
what he's got?

368
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
That's not what I mean.

369
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,500
If he wants to fight,

370
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,780
I won't be surprised.

371
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,260
Now he wants to play with money.

372
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,700
It's not like him.

373
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,500
I think we should find out

374
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
what he's up to.

375
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
You're right.

376
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,420
Do it now.

377
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,420
Okay.

378
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,660
He went to Ninghai alone?

379
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,820
Zixuan, don't worry.

380
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,500
I told Tianyi to keep an eye on him

381
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,980
24 hours

382
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,940
a day.

383
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,020
But I never expected...

384
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,220
that Tianyi

385
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,260
was turned by Binbin.

386
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,940
They went to Ninghai together.

387
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,060
Don't worry.

388
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,540
I told my friends

389
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
in Ninghai

390
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,860
about it.

391
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,820
Besides,

392
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,100
as you know,

393
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,620
they're both smart.

394
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
They'll be fine.

395
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,300
Well, if anything happens,

396
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,500
tell me immediately.

397
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,980
No problem.

398
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,020
(Xing Liang)

399
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,820
Why are you always missing

400
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,940
at critical times?

401
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,620
(Na Fan)

402
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,940
How's it going?

403
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,260
Ms. Wen, I've booked sea cucumbers

404
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,180
from Lian City

405
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,060
and checked them.

406
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,340
I'll send them to you soon.

407
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,180
I also bought some

408
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,300
good abalone and scallops.

409
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,900
If nothing else,

410
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,940
I'll come back tomorrow.

411
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,180
Na Fan,

412
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,260
do you have any

413
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,580
acquaintances in Ninghai?

414
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
I do, but we're not close.

415
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,660
What do you need?

416
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,000
Here's the thing.

417
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,570
Binbin went to Ninghai

418
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,900
for the gunshot case.

419
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,900
I think he might make trouble.

420
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,140
You're close to Ninghai, right?

421
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,620
Keep an eye on him.

422
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,460
I'm worried.

423
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,380
Maybe you can use

424
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,780
your connections there

425
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,540
to ensure his safety.

426
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,660
Okay. I'm on my way.

427
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,740
Don't worry.

428
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,220
Not bad.

429
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,500
Xing.

430
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,540
I thought you were slacking off.

431
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,340
It turns out

432
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,420
you have a big plan.

433
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,480
It's only been a few days,

434
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,060
and you've almost figured it out.

435
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,550
Great.

436
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,420
Good job.

437
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,900
Oh, no.

438
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,340
You're going to

439
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,660
assign me a task, right?

440
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,340
I know all your tricks.

441
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,660
When we were in college,

442
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,220
every compliment

443
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,420
came with a task.

444
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,060
Can we switch our positions?

445
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,060
No.

446
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,580
It always works.

447
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,780
Fine.

448
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,860
You're bullying me.

449
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,140
I don't care.

450
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,100
Anyway, I need to see
the gun and the shooter.

451
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,180
Do you know

452
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,380
what your biggest problem is?

453
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,220
What?

454
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,420
You're too greedy.

455
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,300
What are you doing?

456
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,140
Take a guess.

457
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,700
Look, when we were in college,

458
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,380
you wanted to be the monitor

459
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,460
and pursue the prom queen.

460
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,620
Stop talking about her.

461
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,740
She's in menopause.

462
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,620
I've had a hard time.

463
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,820
You're giving me a hard time.

464
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,020
Who else can I torture?

465
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,100
Who can I torture?

466
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,020
Xuan?

467
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,020
Can I torture her?

468
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
I've had a hard time.

469
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
You can torture Sun Changhai.

470
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,500
You can let him take the pain for you.

471
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,820
It's the law of conservation of energy.

472
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,580
Conservation of energy...

473
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,100
Xing.

474
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,940
You know

475
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,860
someone is using the gun for bad things.

476
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,980
It's not that simple.

477
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,760
The man and the gun,

478
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,600
I'll at least take one back.

479
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,450
Are you happy now?

480
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,460
No.

481
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,420
You can't give me
a 50% discount for that.

482
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,490
Mr. Tai.

483
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,100
Your takeout?

484
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,420
What do you mean?

485
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,460
It's mine now,

486
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,700
and we're even.

487
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,820
Mr. Xing.

488
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,420
How could you let him take it?

489
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,260
(Ninghai City, Beichun Province)

490
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,460
As the saying goes,

491
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,860
a dragon

492
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,820
can't give birth

493
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,500
to a phoenix.

494
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,380
Like father,

495
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,660
like son.

496
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
See? They're all gangsters.

497
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,580
He's a violent bandit

498
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,140
who killed someone.

499
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,780
I can't believe he came back
for his birthday.

500
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,100
His parents died early.

501
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,140
He was brought up by his uncle.

502
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,860
Speaking of which,

503
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,220
this old man

504
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,700
(Zheng Haotian)
led Sun Hao

505
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,300
(Leader of Sun's Criminal Group)
to this path.

506
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,620
It's his 70th birthday.

507
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,900
In my hometown,

508
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,420
if he didn't come,

509
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,900
he'd be an unfilial son.

510
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,220
No matter what,

511
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,180
we don't have enough evidence.

512
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,300
We have no choice

513
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,740
but to keep an eye on them,

514
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
right?

515
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,020
(Ninghai Airlines)

516
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
Okay. Bao, I got it.

517
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,980
Don't worry.

518
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
What should we do without Bao?

519
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,940
What a coward.

520
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,540
You're lost in another city, aren't you?

521
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,220
I'll take you to Ninghai's

522
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,660
information center.

523
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,140
We'll definitely get some real stuff.

524
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,620
Which car?

525
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,100
Here's the gun. I'll take the stuff.

526
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,740
Captain Zhou,

527
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

528
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Sorry to bother you.

529
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,140
No problem.

530
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Mr. Xing, you're so welcome.

531
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,020
We're all brothers.

532
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,380
Director Qian told us

533
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,580
to support your work.

534
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Thank you so much.

535
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,780
It's our pleasure.

536
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,820
When this is over,

537
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,100
we'll treat you to a big meal.

538
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,380
Don't worry.

539
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,950
I'll make three toasts

540
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,340
to you with tea.

541
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,460
I appreciate it.

542
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,600
Mr. Xing, Mr. Zhou,

543
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,980
we've checked
all the corridors and exits.

544
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
- We're ready.
- Okay.

545
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,420
Mr. Zhou,

546
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,140
I need to tell you this.

547
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,980
Go ahead.

548
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,460
The suspect has a gun.

549
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,140
He's very dangerous.

550
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,780
Whether he shows up or not,

551
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,740
we must make a detailed plan.

552
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,900
Once he shows up,

553
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,180
follow him closely.

554
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,140
Don't tip him off.

555
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,020
As soon as he leaves this door,

556
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,220
we'll arrest him.

557
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,060
Roger.

558
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,100
- Chen.
- Yes.

559
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,300
Do your best

560
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,620
and be careful.

561
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,100
If anyone blows it,

562
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,020
- I won't have mercy.
- Yes, sir.

563
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,460
Mr. Xing, anything else?

564
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
- Nothing else.
- Okay.

565
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,060
- I'll arrange it.
- No problem.

566
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,420
Let's keep in touch.

567
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,260
Let's go.

568
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,220
Fei Zai.

569
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,290
Mr. Xing.

570
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Is Bin here?

571
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,620
Well, I...

572
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,740
I reported it to the procuratorate.

573
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,140
If he calls you,

574
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,260
answer it.

575
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,710
We only need to know

576
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,500
what he's doing.

577
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,940
Little brother.

578
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,740
I can't scrub out the dirt.

579
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
Do you want vinegar?

580
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,580
That's not enough, bro.

581
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,060
Use milk. You're worth the price.

582
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,860
Little brother,

583
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,340
I haven't met a generous customer

584
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,620
like you for a long time.

585
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,220
As the saying goes,

586
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,580
all encounters have a reason.

587
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,740
Look,

588
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,500
I chose you

589
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,820
among all the scrub men

590
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,420
because I knew you were a good man.

591
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,900
We're both good men.

592
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,460
I'll give you a big white pear.

593
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,140
Thanks, bro.

594
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,860
I need to tell you something.

595
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,140
You look

596
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,020
familiar.

597
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,540
Do you know Lao'er?

598
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,100
Which Lao'er?

599
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,340
It's a small place.

600
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,060
Who else could it be?

601
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,660
Wang Lao'er from Tiedaoxi,

602
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,540
originally named Yulin?

603
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,740
Exactly,

604
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,580
Wang Yulin.

605
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,380
Are you Yulin's

606
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,260
friend?

607
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,780
Well,

608
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,460
he's my

609
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,580
supplier.

610
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,380
Do you also sell used cars?

611
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,500
Wang Yulin sells used cars,

612
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,780
but I'm doing

613
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,460
import and export automobile trade.

614
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
That's why he's my supplier.

615
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,940
Nowadays,

616
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,140
it's hard to do business.

617
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,940
I'm lucky to have met

618
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,300
a good man like him.

619
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Report, report.

620
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,620
Location No. 1 cleared.

621
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,820
Location No. 2 cleared.

622
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,980
Bro, we do have connections.

623
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,780
My bro Tao

624
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,620
is Yulin's good buddy.

625
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,500
He's a good man.

626
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,100
What's your family name?

627
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,380
It's

628
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,580
Luo.

629
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,260
Just call me Tianyi.

630
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,020
Oh, yeah. Right there.

631
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,900
Scrub it.

632
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
No problem, Tianyi.

633
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,980
To be honest,

634
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,980
I want

635
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,420
to sell some goods

636
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,260
to Da An Alliance.

637
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,500
Do you have any acquaintances there?

638
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,220
Maybe someone

639
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,900
big and strong

640
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,140
and good at fighting.

641
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,380
You can

642
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,740
ask Tao.

643
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,460
Maybe I can call him.

644
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,100
I'll help you. Let's have a drink.

645
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,060
You got me wrong.

646
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,060
Tao and you

647
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
are different.

648
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,980
Well,

649
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,340
he's your friend,

650
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,420
so you need to go with him.

651
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,700
Do you understand?

652
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,140
Yes, yes.

653
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,860
Bro, people from Da An Alliance

654
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,700
always stick together.

655
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,420
If you want someone strong and big,

656
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,820
I can only find you

657
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,100
some junkyard workers.

658
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,140
What junkyard workers?

659
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,700
Where are they?

660
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,140
Bro.

661
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,460
I think

662
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,620
I need to talk to Tao first.

663
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,180
Take... Take a break.

664
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,020
Wait.

665
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,300
What's wrong?

666
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,940
I almost got the answer,

667
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,020
and you broke in.

668
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,500
Let's get out.

669
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,060
Want to be beaten?

670
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,420
Come on. Let's go.

671
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,580
(Body Scrub Zone)

672
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,180
I thought you were so capable.

673
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,700
What information center?

674
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,620
It's just a bathhouse.

675
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,860
What now?

676
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,600
Find Fei Zai.

677
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,020
Did he reply?

678
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,910
He must've been warned.

679
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
What do you mean?

680
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,980
It's not hard to find it.

681
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,420
It's a small place.

682
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,780
How many restaurants do you think
can hold a birthday party

683
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,940
for the gang leader?

684
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,420
We'll check them out.

685
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,300
(Longevity)

686
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,580
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

687
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,060
But I can't get drunk.

688
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,060
You won't.

689
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,620
Okay.

690
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,740
Uncle,

691
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,820
here's to you.

692
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,140
Wish you good luck and longevity.

693
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,420
Tell the waiters

694
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,740
to get out.

695
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,460
You've finished your work.

696
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,900
- Get out.
- Come on.

697
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,940
Okay.

698
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,980
- Here's to you.
- Again?

699
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,140
Wish you good luck and longevity.

700
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,340
Okay, thanks,

701
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,460
but I won't finish it.

702
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,780
Suit yourself.

703
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,980
Mr. Xing...

704
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,260
I... I swear

705
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,060
I didn't tell him.

706
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,540
I'd be surprised

707
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,140
if he didn't show up.

708
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,940
Dear family

709
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,580
and friends!

710
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,100
I'm so...

711
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,220
happy today.

712
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,100
No more words!

713
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,120
Come on.

714
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,860
Cheers!

715
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,180
Happy birthday, uncle.

716
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,260
Hai, you're back.

717
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,820
- Hai.
- Hai.

718
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,940
You're always busy.

719
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,540
We didn't expect you to come.

720
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,820
Hai is a good nephew.

721
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,940
Of course he's back.

722
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,740
Your uncle raised you well.

723
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,580
Of course.

724
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,780
You're a good nephew.

725
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,620
Uncle,

726
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,020
happy birthday. Wish you longevity.

727
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,060
Look.

728
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,140
Your trip

729
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,820
was smooth, right?

730
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,020
Don't worry.

731
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,260
Nothing happened.

732
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,940
Don't let me worry about you.

733
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,140
You must be very careful,

734
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,980
okay?

735
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,820
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

736
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,980
- Okay.
- Take care.

737
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,020
Don't drink too much.

738
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,860
- Okay.
- I'll talk to them.

739
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,100
Stay with my uncle.

740
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,020
Whatever happens, don't leave him,

741
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,100
- okay?
- Okay.

742
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,980
It's for him. Don't waste it.

743
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,340
Brother, be careful.

744
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,700
It's okay. Don't let him drink too much.

745
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,660
We're late. Hurry.

746
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,980
Miss,

747
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,860
didn't you promise

748
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,580
to let me serve the food?

749
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,420
What...

750
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,900
How's it going? Are they having fun?

751
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Exactly.

752
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,540
They're even drinking with the waiter.

753
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,820
Waiter? Well,

754
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,300
do you know him?

755
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,260
No.

756
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,540
He's a part-time

757
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,620
waiter like you.

758
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,860
Okay, go on with your work.

759
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,820
Hello.

760
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,700
What?

761
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,300
(Fire Hydrant)

762
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,420
Mr. Xing,

763
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,820
something happened.

764
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,740
(Camera, Farmhouse 2nd Floor)

765
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,540
Liu Yong, check it out.

766
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,380
Fei Zai.

767
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,860
Hai.

768
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,740
Run! They're fighting!

769
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,580
Run! Run!

770
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,780
Are you okay?

771
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,780
Where's Liu Yong?

772
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,700
Mr. Xing,

773
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,740
he sneaked in
through the kitchen window.

774
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,620
It seems he's fully prepared.

775
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,420
He even prepared a uniform.

776
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,140
Did he go that way?

777
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,220
Yes.

778
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,780
Mr. Xing,

779
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,060
we checked the surveillance,

780
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,300
but we're in a blind spot.

781
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,780
Sun Changhai knew

782
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,700
we'd come

783
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,300
and had an escape plan.

784
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,020
(POLICE)

785
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,940
(Mr. Tai)

786
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,340
Okay, wait a minute.

787
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,660
No clues.

788
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,540
Mr. Tai.

789
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,620
Xing,

790
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,860
do you remember your promise?

791
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,700
The man and the gun,

792
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,180
at least one of them,

793
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,740
right?

794
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,620
What's going on?

795
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,820
He got away,

796
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,020
and the gun went off again!

797
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,020
We're already the joke

798
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,460
of Binjiang,

799
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,500
and now

800
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,460
people in Beichun will also laugh at us.

801
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,020
What have you done?

802
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,780
Listen, Xing,

803
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,660
clean up this mess.

804
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,860
If you can't,

805
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,820
don't come back!

806
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,940
(Xuan)

807
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,740
(Xuan)

808
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,420
Xuan.

809
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,220
Xing Liang, what are you doing?

810
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,820
Do you know Binbin almost died?

811
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,700
Do you also want me to die?

812
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,620
Thank god, I asked

813
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,340
Na Fan to keep an eye on him.

814
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,580
How can I count on you?

815
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,580
Xuan... don't worry.

816
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,700
It's my fault.

817
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,980
I didn't stop him.

818
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,180
But the doctor has said

819
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,300
he is fine.

820
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,740
He's fine?

821
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,060
If not, it'd be too late!

822
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,180
I'm going to Ninghai.

823
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,100
Look at you! What can I say?

824
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,380
Why are you coming?

825
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,980
Liu Yong! Fei Zai!

826
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,300
- Mr. Xing.
- Listen carefully,

827
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,620
block every corner!

828
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,540
We must arrest him here!

829
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,700
Yes, sir.

830
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,460
Does it hurt?

831
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,980
Does it hurt?

832
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,860
Not at all.

833
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,700
It hurts.

834
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,820
Of course it hurts.

835
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,820
It's a serious wound. Let me see.

836
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,980
I can help you. I'll give you...

837
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,580
Stop!

838
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
He's injured.

839
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,140
My sister asked me to stop.

840
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,340
Are you happy?

841
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,740
Why are you laughing?

842
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,180
You said it didn't hurt.

843
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,940
Not at all.

844
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,220
I told you to behave yourself,
but you didn't listen.

845
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,100
The shooter escaped,
and you offended the police.

846
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,780
Stop smiling!

847
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,300
Is it my fault?

848
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,060
Anyway, I'm happy

849
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,900
when you're around.

850
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,260
I don't know why.

851
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,940
Hello, Bao.

852
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,900
Binbin,

853
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,100
how are you

854
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,060
doing?

855
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,020
I'm fine. Don't worry.

856
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,380
Seriously?

857
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,340
Why would I lie?

858
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,580
By the way,

859
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,420
Fan is here too.

860
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,860
Of course I'm fine.

861
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,860
Fan?

862
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,820
Fine.

863
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,380
Enjoy your time with her.

864
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,020
Listen,

865
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,100
that case is complicated.

866
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,300
San

867
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,540
was arrested a few years ago.

868
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,780
He can't help us,

869
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,020
but it doesn't matter.

870
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,540
I talked to a friend there

871
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,660
and find a person

872
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,500
called

873
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,980
Da Lele.

874
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,460
It's said

875
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,620
he has good connections.

876
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,460
You can meet him.

877
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Before that,

878
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,780
you and your...

879
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,260
Fan

880
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,940
should stay where you are.

881
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,060
Don't go anywhere,

882
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
- understand?
- I got it.

883
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,420
Please don't worry.

884
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,740
Bye.

885
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,740
Bao?

886
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,980
What did he say?

887
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,300
He said we worked hard

888
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,420
and deserve a reward.

889
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,620
Come on, Bao's friend is waiting for us.

890
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,700
Okay. Let's go.

891
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,540
Fan.

892
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,260
It's a bathhouse.

893
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,460
You shouldn't go with us.

894
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,100
I'm not going.

895
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,740
You two, don't make trouble.

896
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,940
Got it.

897
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,700
(Ninghai Public Security Bureau)

898
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,860
Mr. Xing,

899
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,100
it's not good.

900
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,220
Mr. Zhou applied for traffic control.

901
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,740
It's not Binjiang.

902
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,220
Many small paths don't have cameras.

903
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,660
We can only speculate about

904
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,860
his escape route.

905
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,500
It's not accurate.

906
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,420
Mr... Mr. Xing.

907
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,580
There's good news, too.

908
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,060
We've got the plate number

909
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,900
of the motorbike.

910
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,340
If we look into it,

911
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,420
we'll find something.

912
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,460
It's much easier to fake a plate

913
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,500
than faking an ID card.

914
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,300
What good news?

00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,580
