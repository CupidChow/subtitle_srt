00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,640
Bin,

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,600
your return to the team

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,160
can't be made public

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,220
for now.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,400
Comrade Wen Binbin,

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,840
your first task after returning

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,240
is to join the investigation

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,910
of the Tuan Island Special Task Force

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,080
as an undercover.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,880
Report all matters

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,320
directly to me.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,560
Okay.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,740
I also want to remind you.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,220
As an ordinary person,

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,540
it's normal to be influenced
by emotions,

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,140
but as a police officer,

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,460
if you act on emotions,

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,180
it will become a stumbling block

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,140
in your pursuit of the truth.

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,860
=Black&White Forest=

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,860
=Episode 23=

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,940
Bao,

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,300
let's steam for a bit

24
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,500
and then

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,340
take a bath.

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,700
After the bath,

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,460
the massage here is amazing.

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,820
I'll arrange it for you,

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,660
so you can relax.

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,500
You're really something.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,420
I just nodded off for a second,

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,180
and you woke me up.

33
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,580
You were asleep?

34
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,420
Alright, we'll take a bath,

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,020
have dinner

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,580
at night,

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,260
and then

38
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,540
go to Tao's place

39
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,500
to relax for a bit.

40
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,060
I've been waiting for that, Bao.

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,940
While you were away,

42
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,100
we didn't even have a smile
on our faces.

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,660
Look, now that you're back,

44
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,860
we've got our energy back.

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,700
Right?

46
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,140
Yeah.

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,740
Why look at me?

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,780
Is something on your mind?

49
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,260
Are you crazy?

50
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,780
I didn't sleep well last night.

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,380
Now my head is killing me.

52
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,160
Did the police station reinstate you?

53
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,700
What nonsense are you saying
in broad daylight?

54
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,380
That's not right.

55
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,900
My sister went to bed
very early last night.

56
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,460
The only thing that could've kept you up

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,780
was either my sister
or the police station.

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,180
No, no, no.

59
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,300
You want to be reinstated

60
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,040
because of my sister.

61
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,430
So, the thing keeping you up

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,690
is still my sister,
you love-stricken fool.

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,550
If you keep talking nonsense,

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
I'll make sure you don't sleep tonight.

65
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,940
Didn't we find the gun, Binbin?

66
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,700
The station should've reinstated you
by now.

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,740
It's not that simple.

68
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,500
Xing Liang said

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,020
the case isn't closed yet,

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,380
so I still have to wait.

71
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
When these cops

72
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,420
couldn't find the gun,

73
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,420
you couldn't go back.

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,140
Then they found it,

75
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,940
but they said
they couldn't close the case.

76
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,420
Once the case is closed,

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,160
there'll definitely be another excuse.

78
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,300
What can I do?

79
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,260
It's up to them.

80
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,380
I have to wait.

81
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,420
Don't lie.

82
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm going to take a dip.

83
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,460
I'll go with you, Bao.

84
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,820
Stay with him.

85
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,180
What do you think of Chen?

86
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,420
Bao valued him so much,

87
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,620
and now he's accusing Bao.

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,460
Do you think Chen did it?

89
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,660
I don't

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,780
think so.

91
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,370
Could it not be him?

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,820
I think it looks like him.

93
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,550
Yeah, that's right.

94
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,240
If you look at the appearance,

95
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,490
it really does look like him.

96
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,460
But I studied that guy

97
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,900
on the motorcycle.

98
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,900
His waist was bent very low.

99
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,820
I know Chen too well.

100
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,380
Forget it, forget it.

101
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,140
A lot of things have happened.

102
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,860
Can he wake up?

103
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,380
Hard to say.

104
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,500
Even if he wakes up,

105
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,420
he might just be a vegetable.

106
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,260
I just checked.

107
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,820
Luo Jiahui wasn't in her ward.

108
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,940
Is she discharged?

109
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,960
Don't mention Luo Jiahui.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,660
The doctor said

111
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,800
she should stay in the hospital
for a few more days,

112
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,500
but she insisted on leaving.

113
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
I think

114
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,140
she's probably eager to make money.

115
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,460
You know, her child was

116
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,100
premature and weak.

117
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,680
There are many things
she needs money for.

118
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,780
But still,

119
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,060
every day she at least checks

120
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,700
on Chen Yiming and her kid.

121
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,340
Do you know where she works?

122
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,380
What are you going to do now?

123
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,580
What can I do in broad daylight?

124
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,740
Come on.

125
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,580
You scared the heck
out of her last time.

126
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,540
If I hadn't handled this,

127
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,280
do you think Mr. Xing
would've let you go?

128
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,140
Bin,

129
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,620
don't cause any more trouble, okay?

130
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,580
I'll apologize to her.

131
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,420
Okay?

132
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,260
(Fresh Coconut, Iced Green/Red Coconut)

133
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,980
(East City Specialty Store)

134
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,460
Hello?

135
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,260
Why is it you again?

136
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,820
Are you following me?

137
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,100
I went to your supermarket to find you,

138
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,900
but your colleague said you were out.

139
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,940
I was going to see you another time,

140
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,600
but I didn't expect
to run into you here.

141
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,140
What do you need from me?

142
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,660
The coercion didn't work,

143
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,200
so you've resorted to money?

144
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,580
I don't mean that.

145
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,220
I've known Chen for many years.

146
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,140
It's just a small gift.

147
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,780
If you still care
about the old friendship with Chen,

148
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,060
please don't bother me anymore.

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,620
Is it really Bao?

150
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,040
Boss,

151
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,720
I confirmed it with Mr. Wang.

152
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,500
The bid opening is set
for tomorrow at noon.

153
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,900
How's the situation over there?

154
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,050
They were just told.

155
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,120
Bao Chenyan's team
will definitely be flustered.

156
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
They'll probably apply for a delay.

157
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,110
That's childish.

158
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,770
Tuan Island is

159
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,800
the center and key
of this upgrade and renovation.

160
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,540
It has taken so long.

161
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,380
The government
can't afford any more delays.

162
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,810
This bid opening

163
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,620
will definitely yield results.

164
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,730
Have you arranged everything?

165
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,710
Yes, all set.

166
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,540
You aren't even qualified now.

167
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,340
Bao,

168
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,040
I wonder how you're going

169
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,660
to play this one.

170
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,620
(Wholesale, Liquor, Drinks, Ice Cream)

171
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,180
Sir.

172
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,460
Well.

173
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,820
Can I watch your

174
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,900
surveillance footage?

175
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,380
I just lost something on that street.

176
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,340
When I came back, it was gone.

177
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,180
Maybe I can track it down.

178
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,860
Sir.

179
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,460
Come on, sir.

180
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,660
Please help me out.

181
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,420
What do you need?

182
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,500
Two boxes of beer.

183
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Five boxes of beer.

184
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,020
I'll take all of your beer

185
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,860
at the store today.

186
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,500
It's 2,000 in total.

187
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,980
Sir.

188
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
Two thousand.

189
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,080
I'll put it in your pocket.

190
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,340
So now,

191
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,820
can I check the surveillance footage?

192
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,780
The camera at the door

193
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,260
has been broken for a long time.

194
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,240
Give me my money back.

195
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,620
That's not going to happen.

196
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,540
Listen.

197
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,100
I have heart disease
and high blood pressure.

198
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,060
Are you trying to send me
to the hospital?

199
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,540
Do you have money?

200
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,940
Come on.

201
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,700
This...

202
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,780
In broad daylight,

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,580
you're robbing me.

204
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,540
A male,

205
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,780
about 1.75 meters tall,

206
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,060
weighing 75 kg.

207
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,140
He wears a black top,

208
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,500
black pants,

209
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,580
and black shoes.

210
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,020
Half an hour before you,

211
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,260
only one person passed by here.

212
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,660
Do you still want your money back?

213
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,860
(Qingyu Fusion Cuisine)
This should be it.

214
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,220
What's the plan for tonight?

215
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,460
Drink until we drop.

216
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,740
Hurry up.

217
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
What the heck? What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,380
You said you'd buy us drinks,

219
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,740
but you brought your own wine?

220
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,340
Help me pay for the car.

221
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,820
Why should I pay?

222
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,940
How stingy.

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,740
- Okay.
- Take the wine.

224
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,610
Coming.

225
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,700
How much is it, sir?

226
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,620
Two hundred.

227
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,780
I've really hit a bad streak.

228
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm always helping you.

229
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,340
Where should we take the wine?

230
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,700
Let's move it inside to drink.

231
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,700
What else? Can we drink at the door?

232
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,340
Listen to me before we start.

233
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,160
I spent all my money on the wine.

234
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,100
I don't have any left.

235
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,340
What are you trying to say?

236
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,740
So you're treating us,

237
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,740
but I pay for the car

238
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,180
and the meal too?

239
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,300
I told you I'm buying drinks.

240
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,260
Just pay a little.

241
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,220
Don't be so stingy.

242
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,100
Well, I...

243
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,940
Do you agree?

244
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,100
Fine, I'm the unlucky one.

245
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,100
What a jerk.

246
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,260
I've been looking for you all afternoon.

247
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,300
Where did you go?

248
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,260
My stomach hurt.

249
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,220
My stomach hurt,
so I went to the hospital.

250
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,780
Let me help with the wine.

251
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,740
Can you handle it?
If you can't, keep resting.

252
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,580
No need, no need.

253
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,860
I'll just stay out of it.

254
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,020
I still need to pay.

255
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,340
I'm wondering if I have enough money.

256
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,340
The wine is almost all inside.

257
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,500
Let's head in first.

258
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,620
Go in. Stop standing there.

259
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,000
Got confused before drinking, huh?

260
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,140
You're not going in?

261
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,140
Then you stay here.

262
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,380
How could the company's qualifications
be in question?

263
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,980
This morning, Mr. Wang called,

264
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,340
saying that

265
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,540
the qualifications of our subsidiary
joint-venture construction company

266
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,340
will expire in three months,

267
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,660
and they aren't qualified.

268
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,180
Then I don't understand.

269
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,220
How did you submit
the application materials

270
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,780
back then?

271
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,540
Actually, I reminded them about this,

272
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,600
but later, with so much on my plate,
I forgot to double-check.

273
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,420
I thought they'd handled everything.

274
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
It's my fault.

275
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
I was careless.

276
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,140
This

277
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,420
is all my fault.

278
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,660
I didn't follow through.

279
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Okay, okay.

280
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,980
There's no point

281
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,860
in saying that now.

282
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,780
What's important is

283
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,140
we need to think about what to do next.

284
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,640
We can only change
the construction company.

285
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,260
After I knew about it,

286
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,660
I immediately contacted

287
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,260
other qualified construction companies.

288
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,540
But they all clearly rejected us,

289
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,420
saying they have a cooperation agreement
with Benniu.

290
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,380
Ms. Wen.

291
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,140
Carry on with your work.

292
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,020
Zixuan.

293
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,260
I've contacted

294
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,500
every friend I could.

295
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,460
We're usually on good terms,

296
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
but today, they just

297
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,540
keep changing the subject.

298
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,980
Someone must be pressuring them.

299
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,060
The sudden notice of the bid opening

300
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,180
probably means someone from above
gave an order.

301
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,740
What do you mean
by "someone from above"?

302
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,380
It's Qi Hanchen.

303
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,260
Bao,

304
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,660
is it true that no matter what,

305
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,100
you won't let go
of the Tuan Island project?

306
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,900
Of course not.

307
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,580
Now, there's only one way left.

308
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,180
What is it?

309
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,380
Sorry.

310
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,020
I got delayed with something.

311
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,860
It's okay, Mr. Qi.

312
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,180
It's our last-minute invitation.

313
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,400
Waiting for you is expected.

314
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,280
Please take a seat.

315
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,160
What's the matter?

316
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,860
You know

317
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,460
why we wanted to see you.

318
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,660
Sorry, Ms. Wen.

319
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,620
I forgot to tell you.

320
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,700
Someone's waiting for me downstairs.

321
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,260
I might only have about ten minutes.

322
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,100
We can relax our previous conditions.

323
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,740
The stall fee will be adjusted based

324
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,860
on last year's performance

325
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,660
and won't fluctuate more than 3%.

326
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,900
Other details can be discussed further.

327
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,700
I just have one question.

328
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Who holds the control?

329
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,780
Of course, it'll be us.

330
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,220
Everything else is negotiable.

331
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,060
Ms. Wen, did I hear it right?

332
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,340
I thought this time you guys

333
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,820
would show some sincerity,

334
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,900
but you surprised me again.

335
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,340
I'm leaving.

336
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,580
You gave us ten minutes.

337
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,500
Don't you want to hear

338
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,580
our backup plan?

339
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,700
A backup plan?

340
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,980
You can't get in.

341
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,500
No plan works.

342
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,100
The backup plan is

343
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,020
for this worst-case scenario.

344
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,980
Mr. Qi.

345
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,500
Mr. Qi.

346
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,540
You must know me.

347
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,540
You've investigated me.

348
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,540
Yes, I know

349
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,300
all the tricks of a gang leader

350
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,280
and how violent it can get
in the underworld.

351
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,020
Today,

352
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,140
it's very rare

353
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,620
for me to brag.

354
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,940
Let me argue with you.

355
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,800
Actually,

356
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,700
the underworld isn't about violence.

357
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,940
What is the underworld?

358
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,620
The underworld

359
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,570
is all about personal connections.

360
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,700
A gang leader in this world

361
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,100
isn't just about fighting
and being ruthless.

362
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,180
It's about loyalty and responsibility.

363
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,260
Thirteen years ago,

364
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,500
I took two hammers,

365
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,180
with four brothers,

366
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,740
came here from the Central Plains,

367
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,820
and faced Wild Jiang head-on.

368
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,220
It took me over a year,

369
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
but I managed to plant my flag
and make my mark.

370
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,460
Before Wild Jiang died,

371
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
he insisted on seeing me.

372
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,500
He said, "Bao."

373
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,920
"I admire you. You're a real man."

374
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,720
"Losing to you is no shame,"

375
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,940
"but I have one request."

376
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,260
I said, "Go ahead."

377
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,100
He said,

378
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,060
"My brothers and I have"

379
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,700
"many relatives and friends
in Tuan Island."

380
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,420
"They're small vendors."

381
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,940
"They're honest and decent."

382
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,180
He hoped

383
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,420
I could let them go.

384
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,860
I said, "No problem."

385
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,340
"Don't worry."

386
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,900
After all these years,

387
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,740
I feel I am

388
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,940
just like Wild Jiang back then.

389
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,540
But I was far

390
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,820
from your level.

391
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,340
I was just nothing,
but you totally nailed it.

392
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,180
No.

393
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
You're a legend.

394
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,980
Do you know?

395
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,180
The money that we made,

396
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,340
including my brothers

397
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,540
the Tuan Island merchants,

398
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,780
and I,

399
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,140
might be the equivalent

400
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,740
of one chopstick of your dish

401
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,380
to you, Mr. Qi.

402
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,900
If you put down your chopsticks,

403
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,420
all of us can survive

404
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,980
and have food to eat.

405
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,580
I can burn incense for you
twice a month.

406
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,700
I can even kowtow.

407
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,100
But if you insist
on raising your chopsticks

408
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,180
to get the dish

409
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,020
for a bite,

410
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,300
then we're no longer able

411
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,340
to make ends meet.

412
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,740
You're forcing me

413
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,480
to go back to 13 years ago

414
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,460
and pick up a hammer to fight you.

415
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Mr. Qi,

416
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,860
I'm really curious.

417
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,980
You're born wealthy.

418
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,700
Is it worth it to risk your life

419
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,980
to fight a worthless man like me?

420
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,380
- I can't drink.
- I...

421
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,420
I'm leaving.

422
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,340
Go then.

423
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,380
Be safe.

424
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,300
Okay, okay.

425
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,820
We're leaving. Let's go.

426
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,980
Er'leng.

427
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,040
Why are you two here?

428
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,220
I called you to sing earlier.

429
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,740
Why didn't you go?

430
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,700
It was too noisy.

431
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,660
We wanted some peace.

432
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,800
Let's sit for a while.

433
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,780
Okay.

434
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,820
Er'leng.

435
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,820
What were you doing

436
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,320
at 3 PM this afternoon?

437
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,780
I went to restock.

438
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,260
Restock?

439
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
I remember you said this afternoon

440
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
you had a stomach ache
and went to the hospital.

441
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,860
I'm such a fool.

442
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,020
I remembered it wrong.

443
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,060
I went to the hospital
because of my stomach ache.

444
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,660
I saw it.

445
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,500
You secretly met with Luo Jiahui.

446
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,940
What's the deal?

447
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,720
If you don't explain it today,

448
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,220
our brotherhood ends here.

449
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,100
You must've seen it wrong.

450
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,340
I didn't even see you.

451
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,540
How could you see me?

452
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,460
Did you make a mistake?

453
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,460
Er'leng,

454
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,100
Bao treats you well, right?

455
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,620
Why are you betraying him?

456
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,180
How could I betray Bao?

457
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,780
I dropped out of elementary school
and started following him.

458
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,980
The heavens can bear witness

459
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,140
to my loyalty to him

460
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,380
and to you all.

461
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,940
Then just tell me what you were doing

462
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,060
this afternoon

463
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,980
with Luo Jiahui.

464
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,940
What's wrong?

465
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,100
Speechless, huh?

466
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Do you admit you're a traitor now?

467
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,180
Who is the traitor?

468
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,900
You...

469
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,540
Do you think I'm a traitor?

470
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,380
What else?

471
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,800
Do you think the same way?

472
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,260
How could I be?

473
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,460
It was Bao who sent me.

474
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,700
He told me to give Luo Jiahui
some money.

475
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,340
Bao told you to give Luo Jiahui money?

476
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,780
Do you know what Bao hates most?

477
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,540
Big Eye Chen caused him so much trouble,

478
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,260
and Luo Jiahui is Chen's wife.

479
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,820
Bao told you to give her money?

480
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,900
Who are you trying to fool?

481
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,700
I'm not fooling you.

482
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,920
I don't get it, either.

483
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,940
If I could figure it out,

484
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,300
he wouldn't have asked me to go.

485
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,340
If I could figure it out,

486
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,180
it wouldn't be me.

487
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,580
I would've been you, okay?

488
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,660
I'm telling you.

489
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,580
You two grew up under my watch.

490
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,100
You can't look at me like this.

491
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,740
I can never

492
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,620
betray my brothers.

493
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,460
I can never be a traitor.

494
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,940
About this,

495
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,980
I'm only telling you both.

496
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,580
Don't tell anyone else.

497
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,140
Please, don't ruin my life. I beg you.

498
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,070
I hereby announce

499
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,420
the Tuan Island Trading Center

500
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,170
Renovation and Upgrade Project

501
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,540
will be jointly undertaken by Wen Group

502
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,740
and MorningStar Group.

503
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,300
Stop drinking.

504
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,900
You got it all over your face.

505
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,140
Today,

506
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,660
let me

507
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,780
say a few words.

508
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,820
Sure.

509
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,180
Today is a day for all to celebrate.

510
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,300
- Right?
- Right.

511
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,460
So,

512
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,180
just drink and take everyone else down.

513
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,940
I have one request:

514
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,460
Among all brothers,

515
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,780
we can't let anyone walk

516
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,780
out of this door

517
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,340
standing.

518
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,980
- Alright.
- Okay.

519
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,040
Cheers to Bao.

520
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,340
You can drink less.

521
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,060
I haven't seen everyone so happy
in a long time.

522
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,500
You know, this Tuan Island project

523
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,900
has had so many twists and turns,

524
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,430
but the outcome is good now.

525
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,940
It's been worth the hard work.

526
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,860
Yeah,

527
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,740
if it weren't for Qi causing trouble,

528
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,040
it could've been even better.

529
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,260
Bao,

530
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,380
we now hold 47%

531
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,500
of the shares,

532
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,860
just one percent less than them.

533
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,340
Plus, we have support
from the Tuan Island vendors

534
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,660
and the operational control.

535
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,620
This outcome is already great.

536
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,140
Think on the bright side.

537
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,940
Though Qi Hanchen's involved now,

538
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,580
the control is still in your hands.

539
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,980
Besides, there's also Mr. Lin's funds.

540
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,180
He won't cause any trouble.

541
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,060
Yeah.

542
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,780
You don't need to comfort me.

543
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,140
I really don't care about him.
He's just a pretty boy.

544
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,820
What bothers me is

545
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,860
his expression.

546
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,180
He's always putting on airs.

547
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,020
It's a bit annoying.

548
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,740
You're just used to hearing
your brothers

549
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,220
call you Bao all the time.

550
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,980
You're used to being the boss.

551
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,040
You can't stand others
bossing you around.

552
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,780
No.

553
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,980
He knows.

554
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,060
As long as they're right,

555
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,040
of course, I'll listen.

556
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,300
Besides, Zixuan,

557
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,520
after all these years,

558
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,780
when have I not listened

559
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,900
to you?

560
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,740
You may be willing to listen,

561
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,180
but I don't want to lecture you.

562
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,380
What's wrong?

563
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,900
What did I say wrong?

564
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,780
My task is done.

565
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,140
I should return the shares
of Tuan Island to you.

566
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,380
We agreed on it from the beginning.

567
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,140
I believe, under your management,

568
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,460
the people of Tuan Island

569
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,660
will have better lives.

570
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,520
Alright, you guys drink here.

571
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,140
It's too noisy.
I can't hear anything.

572
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,980
I'm leaving.

573
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,820
Sit for a while.

574
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,760
The driver is downstairs.
No need to see me off.

575
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,580
Binbin.

576
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,430
- Drink less. I'm leaving.
- Fruit.

577
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,140
- Ms. Wen, I'll see you off.
- Thanks.

(Siji International Hotel)

579
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,420
Thank you.

580
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,500
Boss.

581
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,780
What's our next move?

582
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,460
Gather the shares

583
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,620
from the Tuan Island vendors

584
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,260
as soon as possible.

585
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,780
Didn't Mr. Jiang

586
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,940
ask us to maintain
the current situation for now?

587
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,380
I never do anything without certainty.

588
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,380
Don't trust anyone.

589
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,540
We must take control

590
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,660
into our own hands.

591
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,820
Mr. Jiang.

592
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,900

The Lin family's financial project

594
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,700
has been launched.

595
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,540
Everything will proceed as planned.

596
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,300
Mr. Jiang,

597
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,580
let me remind you.

598
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,860
We are just partners.

599
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,060
We will cooperate appropriately
to protect

600
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,560
our company's interests.

601
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,140
If there are any negative outcomes
in the future,

602
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,460
you should prepare a way out.

603
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,220
Of course.

604
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,630
No, no.

605
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,500
This way.

606
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,170
No.

607
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,800
Did you just pee?

608
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,920
Did you get it on your hand?
Did you wash your hands?

609
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,060
- Smell it.
- Go away.

610
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,500
- Go.
- Go ahead.

611
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,900
Stay steady, okay?

612
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,940
When we go in,
avoid drinking if you need to.

613
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,220
I won't avoid drinking.

614
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,420
(Puyan Dancing Hall)

615
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,140
Many guests are here.
Take care of them.

616
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,500
You just have to deal with it.

617
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,930
How much have you drunk?

618
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,780
Tao.

619
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,180
Bin, watch him closely.

620
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,500
Tao.

621
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,180
I'm not drunk.

622
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,020
Chen. You're Chen from Xiyuehui.

623
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,180
See? Tao, I know her. I'm not drunk.

624
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,500
Tao.

625
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,660
Have a few girls to come

626
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,300
to have fun with us in our private room.

627
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,380
You're acting strange.

628
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,220
What's wrong?

629
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,380
Go call a few more girls.

630
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,260
Go.

631
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,550
Have a drink.

632
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,230
Keep drinking.

633
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,640
Just get him drunk.

634
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,030
Come on.

635
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,360
Come on, cheers.

636
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,620
Four fives.

637
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,900
Four fives? Four sixes.

638
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,220
Five sixes.

639
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,500
One.

640
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,700
Six.

641
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,740
Drink.

642
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,420
Good for you.

643
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,380
You really got me. I'm telling you.

644
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,100
You are...

645
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,780
You're from Xiyuehui, right?

646
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,180
I used to go there often.

647
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,860
I've never lost.

648
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
There's a girl

649
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,140
named Hui, right?

650
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,580
I can tell you haven't been there
for a long time.

651
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,060
She quit a long time ago.

652
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,900
Really?

653
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,140
Why?

654
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,460
She found a man to settle down with.

655
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,340
How did they meet?

656
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,280
Are you concerned about her?

657
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,020
I'm just curious.

658
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,260
I'll drink on my own, okay?

659
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,780
What happened?

660
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,380
Actually, I'm not too sure either.

661
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,220
We only found out about it

662
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,180
when she resigned.

663
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,620
She didn't usually talk
about her personal life.

664
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,580
At the time, we even said

665
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,860
she should bring the guy over
to meet us.

666
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,100
But she didn't appreciate it.

667
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,460
By the way, she used to say

668
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,100
she wanted to find a good man like Bao.

669
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,380
I wonder if she got her wish.

670
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,340
She knew Bao?

671
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,060
Of course.

672
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,660
I used to bring her here often.

Uncle Man.

675
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,300
Are you okay?

676
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,860
I'm fine.

677
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,500
I just drank too much.

678
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,660
I didn't notice

679
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,860
that you're quite popular
with the girls.

680
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,060
You drank so much.

681
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,700
That's not true.

682
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,060
It was all arranged by Bao.

683
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,740
It was a mess.

684
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,420
Bao was just worried about you

685
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,100
because you're so old

686
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,580
and still alone.

687
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,340
I'm not like Chen.

688
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,140
I don't like this kind of thing.

689
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,100
I don't like it.

690
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,740
Bao used to introduce
girlfriends to Chen?

691
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,380
He introduced

692
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,500
Chen's wife

693
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,420
to him, right?

694
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,700
You didn't know that?

695
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,700
Bao...

696
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,340
Liang,

697
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,420
I'd like to believe

698
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,860
that Bao is innocent.

699
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,340
But I promise you.

700
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,100
I will never show favoritism,

701
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,300
let alone cover for him.

702
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,580
Bao introduced Luo Jiahui
to Big Eye Chen.

703
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,860
Bao hiding this is indeed suspicious.

704
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,220
I've always thought

705
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,300
Qi Hanchen is the biggest suspect.

706
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,520
But

707
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,300
after the Tuan Island
investment conference,

708
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,260
he left.

709
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,300
If he really was

710
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,020
the mastermind,

711
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,100
he wouldn't have been willing

712
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,220
to settle for the current result.

713
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,300
Leaving at this time

714
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,980
could also be a tactic to mislead us,

715
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
letting us relax
before he makes a big move.

716
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,860
It's not impossible.

717
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,060
Actually, you also think

718
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,400
Bao isn't the person you're looking for.

719
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
Right?

720
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,580
Now, all the evidence

721
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,540
points to him as the biggest suspect.

722
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,940
But

723
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,700
from my years of understanding
and observation

724
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,500
about him,

725
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,020
he doesn't seem like the mastermind.

726
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,720
He's not clever enough.

I can't speak. You go.

Good, good.

00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,500
This should be where Mr. Bao

741

is standing,

742
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,220
but today, this bearded man

is shy.

and say a few words.

745
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,370
- Great.
- Great.

Well.

00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,140
Good.

Originally, this location

754
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,780
was already very favorable,

755
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,280
with a lot of foot traffic.

756
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,860
Once the Trading Center is completed,

757
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,140
the environment

758
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,260
and infrastructure

759
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,500
will be much better

760
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
than before.

761
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,060
We will make

762
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,180
great improvements.

763
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Here's another good news.

764
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,900
Thanks to Mr. Bao's

765
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,060
relentless efforts,

766
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,260
we've secured

767
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,900
favorable conditions

768
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,820
for the old merchants of Tuan Island.

769
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,260
What kind of preferential policies
are there?

770
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,420
Do you want to know?

771
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,660
Yes!

772
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,620
Let me tell you.

773
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,660
First,

774
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,620
we will give priority to relocating
the old merchants.

775
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,820
Second,

776
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,620
the stall prices

777
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,260
will also have discounted policies

778
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,100
for the old merchants.

779
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,100
Also...

780
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Listen carefully.

781
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,740
The old merchants

782
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,620
have the right

783
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,100
to choose their store locations first.

784
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,580
- Is that good?
- Yes!

785
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,340
Let's thank Mr. Bao.

786
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,420
One, two, three.

787
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,940
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

788
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,420
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

789
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,020
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

790
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,580
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

791
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,940
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

792
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,220
Good, good.

793
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,260
If anyone has any other needs,

794
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,660
you can always come to me.

795
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,740
I promise

796
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,220
to do my best to meet
everyone's needs, okay?

797
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,420
Okay!

798
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,340
The upper floors here are livable.

799
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,260
There's a garden ahead,

800
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,820
great for a walk

801
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,340
or taking the kids out.

802
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,980
You can pick your storefront later.

803
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,060
Behind the building,

804
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,060
there's a parking lot.

805
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,660
It won't be chaotic,
with cars all over the yard.

806
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,080
The parking lot has several floors.

807
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,060
How much

808
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,260
do you think it will cost to move here?

809
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,380
Didn't Man just say?

810
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,860
The stall fee is discounted for us.

811
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,380
I know.

812
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,060
But you think about it.
To move to a new store,

813
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,100
apart from the stall fees

814
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,180
and renovation costs,

815
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,140
there are other expenses.

816
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,820
With all these little things adding up,

817
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,780
it's still a hefty amount.

818
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,580
Everyone,

819
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,060
please stop taking photos.

820
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,160
Listen to me for a moment.

821
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,340
We've looked at the upper floors, right?

822
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
There's also a lot
to check out downstairs.

823
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,900
Everyone, spread out,

824
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,860
walk around, and take a look.

825
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,540
If you have any thoughts or suggestions,

826
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,900
tell Mr. Man later.

827
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,220
- Okay.
- Okay.

828
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,340
Hui.

829
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,340
Come here.

830
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,260
Bao.

831
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,940
Your father is sick
and in the hospital.

832
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,860
I know.

833
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,740
How's he doing?

834
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,420
He's better now.

835
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,580
It's just an old problem.

836
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,660
He needs to rest properly.

837
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,980
Let me tell you.

838
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,580
You're moving to a new store,

839
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,860
and your father is in the hospital.

840
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,860
I know money's tight for you.

841
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,260
If it's really tough,

842
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,500
just let me know.

843
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,580
No need, no need.

844
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,360
Bao.

845
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,980
You have an appointment with Mr. Tian.

846
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,380
It's almost time. You should go.

847
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,460
What do you mean by "no need"?

848
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,740
If you have difficulties,
tell me.

849
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,420
After all these years,
you should know me.

850
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,380
No need to be polite.

851
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,140
Alright, go take a look.

852
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,260
Go back.

853
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,740
Bao,

854
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,780
the new market is on track now.

855
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,540
I'll keep an eye
on the construction site.

856
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,900
Aren't you tired

857
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,780
from coming here?

858
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,820
Yes, I am.

859
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,340
Let me tell you.

860
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,100
My body is really

861
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,500
not what it used to be.

862
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,520
Glad you know
you're not getting any younger,

863
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,560
yet you're still trying
to do everything yourself.

864
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,140
You need to learn to relax a bit.

865
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,500
Right, you're right.

866
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,060
I'll learn to relax.

867
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,160
With you here,
I have nothing to worry about.

868
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,940
Man,

869
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,700
I have to remind you.

870
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,140
Most of these people

871
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,180
here now

872
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,260
are our old neighbors

873
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,220
and old friends, right?

874
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,300
We've been together all these years
in the market.

875
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,760
They're moving to a new store now.

876
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,860
Their families

877
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,100
are all quite poor.

878
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,620
If they have any difficulties,

879
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,760
you need to show more care.

880
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,260
If you can help, help them out.

881
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,300
Bao, our funds are also tight.

882
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,780
Our funds are tight,

883
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,140
but are they tighter than theirs?

884
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,740
Has Lin's funds

885
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,020
been secured?

886
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,560
They're a big group.

887
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,820
There are a lot of regulations,

888
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,740
so

889
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,900
it might take some time.

890
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,740
I'll ask again later.

891
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,700
This matter

892
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,820
has to be rushed.

893
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,060
Don't worry.

894
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm leaving now.

895
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,700
Bao, give me that hat.

896
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,100
Every time I wear this hat,

897
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,460
it messes up my hairstyle.

898
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,700
Man,

899
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,920
you're at the construction site
every day.

900
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,060
Be careful.

901
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,460
Alright.

902
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,130
I'm leaving now.

903
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,340
Bao.

904
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,660
Cheers to you, Bao.

905
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,620
Bao.

906
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Mr. Huang.

907
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,340
I'm counting on you

908
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,900
about the Tuan Island matter.

909
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,940
Sure.

910
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,140
Thanks, everyone.

911
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,380
It's always better to see it in person.

912
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,460
Good drinker.

913
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,340
Good drinker, good drinker.

914
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,690
I've never drunk with you.

915
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,840
I'll take this pot of wine.

916
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,500
Binbin,

917
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,700
I have a bottle of wine
in my car's trunk.

918
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,660
It's been there for over a year.

919
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,540
Bring it up.
I'll drink it with Mr. Huang.

920
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,200
I'll step out for a moment.

921
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,140
Mr. Huang.

922
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,300
Thanks.

923
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,700
Thanks, everyone.

924
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,180
- Come on.
- Come on.

925
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,260
I won't let Bao get drunk, alright?

926
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,260
Okay, I'm hanging up.

927
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
I'm going in now.

928
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,780
It's Tao again?

929
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,100
It sure is.

930
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,660
Even if she didn't call us,

931
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,820
we'd still take care of Bao.

932
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,460
What do you know?

933
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,880
Lately, Bao has had
too many social events.

934
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,900
Tao is worried those wild butterflies
will flock to him.

935
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,220
She's trying to get me to talk.

936
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,940
It's really not necessary.

937
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,780
It really is.

938
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,660
If Bao were like you,

939
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,940
reporting his schedule
every day without fail,

940
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,540
it wouldn't be necessary.

941
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,080
Has your sister mentioned it to you?

942
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,660
Does my sister need to mention it?

943
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,300
I'm not blind.

944
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,620
You're always on that phone,

945
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,460
complaining and complaining.

946
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,740
Do you think I'm complimenting you?

947
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,620
As a grown man,
can you be a little more reserved?

948
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,660
You're just a bit jealous of me.

949
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,980
You want someone
to report your schedule,

950
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
but you've got no one.

951
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,980
Do I even need that?

952
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,540
Hurry up and go in.

953
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,780
I saw that scene just now.

954
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,940
They're feeding Bao drinks.

955
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,980
Bao's about to collapse.

956
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,220
Why does Tu Manjiang keep arranging

957
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,540
these events for Bao?

958
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,300
I'll go get some alcohol deterrents.

959
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,340
Bao.

960
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,020
Let's go home, Bao.

961
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,740
Bao.

962
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,540
Bao.

963
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,460
Everyone's gone?

964
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,180
They're all gone.

965
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,420
Let him drink this deterrent.

966
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,300
Don't.

967
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,500
After all that wine,
he won't be able to handle this.

968
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,900
How about you help me lift him up?

969
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,900
Bao.

970
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,420
- Bao.
- Let's go home.

971
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,730
- Let's go home.
- One, two. Let's go.

972
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,020
Why are you... Come here.

973
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,980
Let's go.

974
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,740
Slow down.

975
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,780
Come on.

976
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,020
Hui...

977
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,580
Has the money

978
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,380
been delivered to Hui's house?

979
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,540
I went a couple of days ago, Bao,

980
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,220
but Hui refuses to take it.

981
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,980
He says he doesn't need the money.

982
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,420
Does he feel

983
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,620
ashamed to take it?

984
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,900
Based on his behavior,

985
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,180
I don't think he was lying.

986
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,140
Could it be that he borrowed money

987
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,280
from relatives and friends?

988
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,860
Last time, when his father was sick,

989
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,380
he borrowed money
from relatives and friends, right?

990
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,240
He said they're scared of him now.

991
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,860
Yeah.

992
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,780
Go...

993
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,380
Let's go to Hui's house.

994
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,300
Let's take Bao back.

995
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,580
We can go alone.

996
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,740
It's really strange.

997
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,060
He refused money from us.

998
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,960
Has he gone to borrow money
from loan sharks?

999
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,340
From his reaction just now,

1000
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,540
I don't think he has.

1001
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,140
He really doesn't want too much money.

1002
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,820
Not everyone is like you,

1003
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,770
with no shame or pride.

1004
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,980
Can you speak properly?

1005
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,660
Don't make personal attacks.

1006
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,060
You're the last person qualified
to say that.

1007
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,500
Who's always treating Uncle Man

1008
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
in a weird, sarcastic way for no reason?

1009
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,980
I'm not being weird.

1010
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,580
Let me tell you.

1011
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,060
If he doesn't provoke me,
I wouldn't even bother with him.

1012
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,660
I know you don't like Uncle Man,

1013

but don't go too far.

1014
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,660
Just pretend a little.

1015
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,580
I'm genuine.

1016
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,460
I can't pretend.

1017
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Do you think

1018
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,820
I'm being weird now?

1019
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,500
Let me tell you.

1020
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,460
One day,

1021
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,940

How much is the interest?

The amount and the deposit term

1051
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,640

I've been busy
with socializing recently.

1076
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,900
I haven't been to the Tuan Island Market

in a long time.

You're saying

00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,360
Mr. Lin Yisheng started
some kind of project?

I'll talk to you later.

That "Make Money"...

Mr. Lin.

1083
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,020
Ms. Wen, what brings you here?

1084
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,500
I've never been here before.

1085
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,340
I was just passing by today.

1086
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,500
I didn't expect

1087
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,580
there would be a surprise.

1088
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,620
Do you have time to chat?

1089
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,860
Sure.

1090
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,140
Mr. Lin,

1091
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,900
does Bao know

1092
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,620
about this Make Money project

1093
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,980
you're doing?

1094
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,580
This is something

1095
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,100
I didn't plan out well.

1096
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,980
I haven't had the chance
to tell Mr. Bao.

1097
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,220
You haven't had the chance,

1098
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,460
or you just didn't plan to tell him?

1099
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,780
I'm doing this

1100
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,500
not just to make money.

1101
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,180
I really want to help the merchants

1102
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,660
in Tuan Island.

1103
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,060
Since we're partners,

1104
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,420
it doesn't seem quite right

1105
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,740
to make such a major decision

1106
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,280
without informing us first.

1107
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,700
Ms. Wen,

1108
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,740
I'd like to apologize to you first.

1109
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,560
But the Tuan Island project

1110
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,080
is something I've been insisting on.

1111
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,440
Only after convincing my family

1112
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,000
did they reluctantly agree to invest.

1113
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,220
But the condition is

1114
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,260
I need to show some results first

1115
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,300
before they'll confirm the investment.

1116
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,740
So you're saying

1117
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,420
you don't have the funds

1118
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,220
for this investment now?

1119
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,340
Don't worry.

1120
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,460
As long as this project succeeds,

1121
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,100
I'm sure my family
will approve the money.

1122
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,860
What? Wait.

1123
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,140
I don't quite understand

1124
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,500
the relationship
between these two things.

1125
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,260
Ms. Wen, don't worry.

1126
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,260
Let me explain it to you.

1127
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,220
We did a survey.

1128
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,220
The occupancy rate
for the new market is low.

1129
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,180
The key reason

1130
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,110
is that the merchants
don't have enough money,

1131
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,840
not that there's a lack of foot traffic.

1132
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,140
This project

1133
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,620
can precisely solve

1134
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,100
the funding problems

1135
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,300
of both new and old merchants.

1136
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,000
When the market occupancy rate rises,

1137
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,240
there will be more options
for attracting investment.

1138
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,950
With more investment options,

1139
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,620
the market will naturally profit.

1140
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,380
Everyone will benefit.

1141
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,900
This creates a virtuous cycle.

1142
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,780
But if... I mean

1143
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,940
if the merchants are stuck
with money issues,

1144
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,220
then no one

1145
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,380
will make a profit.

1146
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,530
Has this project undergone
a risk assessment?

1147
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,380
Every investment has risks.

1148
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,960
Do you believe in investments

1149
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,700
without risks?

1150
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,580
Of course, our Guotai Group

1151
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,700
specializes in financial services.

1152
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,200
There's no problem with that.

1153
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,860
I can not only guarantee

1154
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,000
the safety of the funds,

1155
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,180
but also help the merchants
in Tuan Island

1156
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,060
get

1157
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,940
the best deals.

(Marketing Center)

1159
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,940
I've read the project proposal.

1160
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,300
From the process perspective,

1161
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,180
there's no problem.

1162
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,780
The qualifications are also compliant.

1163
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,140
But I just don't feel at ease.

1164
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,660
Are you worried

1165
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,420
something might be wrong
with Lin Yisheng?

1166
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,020
That's not it.

1167
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,660
I can't tell now.

1168
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,180
I don't

1169
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,060
understand accounts,

1170
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,980
but I know people very well.

1171
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,380
Don't worry.

1172
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
If Lin Yisheng is honest,
that'd be perfect.

1173
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,700
If he tries anything shady,

1174
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,220
I'll make sure he suffers a lot.

1175
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:50,860
Don't worry.

(Choose "Make Money" to Enjoy Your Life)

1177
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,460
I knew this guy knew it long ago.

1178
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,420
He's been colluding with outsiders
to scam the neighbors.

1179
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,900
Such a traitor.

1180
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,460
So many people are here.

1181
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,680
Don't let anyone laugh at us.

1182
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,840
I'm going to catch him now.

1183
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,140
Let's see how he'll explain it.

1184
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,700
Stay here.

1185
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,840
Don't move.

(Birkin Paris Club)

1189
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,060
Bao,

1190
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,040
that ingrate has been deliberately
hiding things from you.

1191
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,300
I wondered why he arranged

1192
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,700
such a busy schedule for you.

1193
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,700
It was just to buy time for them.

1194
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,900
I'm aware

1195
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,460
of this matter.

1196
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,820
Over the years,

1197
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,650
the company has developed so fast

1198
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,620
thanks to Man's hard work.

1199
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,180
Both of you know

1200
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,300
how much effort he put

1201
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,220
into the Tuan Island Market.

1202
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,220
If

1203
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,900
he hid this

1204
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,300
from me,

1205
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,140
then he's definitely hiding

1206
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,140
more things from me.

1207
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,620
Bao, look at this.

1208
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,020
Photos don't prove much,

1209
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,860
but he still never explained

1210
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,220
why he went to Guanhai Tea House.

1211
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,180
At that time,
I didn't have any substantial evidence,

1212
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,400
and you weren't around.

1213
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,940
The company was relying on Uncle Man,

1214
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,660
so I didn't speak out.

1215
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,220
But looking back,

1216
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,980
his attitude since that day

1217
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,540
