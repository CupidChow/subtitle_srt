1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,940
(Twenty-two years ago)

2
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,940
(Bao Chenyan, young)

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,300
I know the situation
back home isn't good.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,940
(Wen Liangsong, founder of Wen Group)

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,380
I didn't expect it to be this bad.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,040
A tree dies when it moves,

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,140
but a person thrives.

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,860
While you're still young,
it's good to get out

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,820
and see the world.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,580
What are your plans for the future?

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,780
My parents told me

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,380
to follow your arrangements

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,780
after I came here.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,420
I'm strong.

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,560
I can endure hardship.

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,900
I can do anything.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,740
Alright.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,940
Then you can stay.

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,940
- Sure.
- Can you drive?

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,100
I can.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,900
I got my driver's license back home.

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,060
Then in the future,

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,540
you'll handle your brother's school run.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,140
Okay.

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,740
What's your name again?

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,980
Uncle, my name is Bao Chenyan.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,300
You're quite energetic, young man.

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,900
From now on, I'll call you Bao.

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,260
Alright.

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,900
Don't be so formal.

31
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,460
From now on,

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,860
we're family.

33
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,780
There are

34
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,300
four people in the family.

35
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,900
We have a cleaning lady.

36
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,540
I'll introduce you later.

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,100
Okay, okay.

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,420
=Black&White Forest=

39
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,420
=Episode 5=

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,780
Hello?

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,300
Where are you? Hurry and pick me up.

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,140
We're on our way.

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,640
I'll send you the location.

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,580
Hurry up.

45
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,660
Back up. Back up. Back up.

46
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,460
Everyone, move back. Move back.

47
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,140
Fei Zai!

48
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,620
Fei Zai!

49
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,500
Fei Zai!

50
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,660
Fei...

51
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,100
Fei Zai!

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
Are you alright?

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,460
Step aside.

54
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,120
Stop. You can't enter.

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,420
Please cooperate with our work.

56
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,340
What's going on?

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,180
(Police)

58
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Mr. Chen.

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,900
Where are you going?

60
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,520
- What a coincidence.
- Let's go and talk.

61
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,940
What's wrong?

62
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,900
Come on.

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,140
Get in my car and wait.

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,380
Mr. Xing,

65
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,900
I'm not feeling well.

66
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,820
Don't scare me.

67
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,900
Dian Lao'er.

68
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,640
A shot was fired at Wallace.

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,700
The gunman is the one coming for money.

70
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,060
No, no. This isn't true.

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,900
Tell me.

72
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,360
What else do you know?

73
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,580
Really...

74
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,980
I don't know much.

75
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,830
Let me tell you.

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,860
Your cooperation doesn't matter.

77
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,180
We'll catch him sooner or later.

78
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm still patient with you now.

79
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm giving you a chance.

80
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,020
I...

81
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,220
Dian Lao'er!

82
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,860
Dian Lao'er!

83
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,980
Dian Lao'er!

84
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,500
Dian Lao'er!

85
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,740
Come on.

86
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,900
More noodles?

87
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm good.

88
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,860
Tell me.

89
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,980
Who is your contact?

90
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,900
Uncle Long.

91
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,180
He's in Gang City.

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,980
I can help you get in touch with him.

93
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,060
Whether you can catch him or not

94
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,580
is another story.

95
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,420
Contact him now.

96
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,060
Mr. Xing,

97
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,340
these people are ruthless.

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,180
You can't push me into the fire pit.

99
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,020
Cut it out.

100
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,860
You brought them in.

101
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,700
From the start, you were involved.

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,040
Your only way out now

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,340
is to cooperate with the police

104
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,540
so we can catch that suspect.

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,980
Got it?

106
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
The problem is

107
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,980
I'm willing to help,

108
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,020
but you need to guarantee my safety.

109
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,380
Do you know what to say?

110
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,300
I'm giving you money.

111
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Why am I begging you?

112
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,580
Where are you?

113
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
Dian Lao'er.

114
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,580
You've got some guts

115
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,780
to cooperate with the police.

116
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,620
Keep your money

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,300
for your coffin.

118
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,820
Within a month,

119
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,820
you'll lose your life.

120
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,060
Mr. Xing,

121
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,340
this is bad.

122
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,580
I've caused all this trouble.

123
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,940
What should I do?

124
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,900
You have to guarantee my safety.

125
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,820
Mr. Xing,

126
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,220
you can't leave me hanging.

127
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,380
Now you're scared?

128
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,820
Why did you start it?

129
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,820
I was just mopping the floor inside,

130
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,900
and I accidentally bumped into someone.

131
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,620
That person, then...

132
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,060
He later fell.

133
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,420
- Bin.
- What does this mean?

134
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,380
Captain Liu ordered it.

135
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,940
No unauthorized personnel allowed near.

136
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,940
We're all brothers who've been

137
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,100
through the same stuff.

138
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,020
Now I'm considered an outsider?

139
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,920
Bin, I didn't mean it like that.

140
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,720
But Mr. Liu specifically told me this.

141
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,900
There's nothing I can do.

142
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,700
I'm really worried about Fei Zai.

143
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,260
I just want a look.

144
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,500
I won't make it hard for you.

145
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,100
Bin, I'm sorry. Bin...

146
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,780
Let him in.

147
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,860
Come here.

148
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,100
How's he doing?

149
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
His condition is stable.

150
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,140
Nothing serious.

151
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,780
We need to ask him something.

152
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,820
Okay.

153
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,100
This is really strange.

154
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,540
I want to send money but can't.

155
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,100
I want to send money but can't!

156
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,940
I've never heard of such an absurd thing

157
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,020
in my life.

158
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,540
These police officers are just bored.

159
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,500
Why do they keep an eye
on me all the time?

160
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,700
How did they smell it?

161
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,300
Do they have dogs' noses?

162
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,260
Do you think...

163
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,740
The phone?

164
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,860
Do you think...

165
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,540
They've heard everything I said earlier?

166
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Have you checked the list
as I requested?

167
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,060
Lao'er, sorry.

168
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,500
I've been with you these days,

169
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,660
raising and paying the money.

170
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,780
I haven't had the time.

171
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,180
Hurry up.

172
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,900
That's important.

173
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,740
Don't worry.

174
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,180
I've sent someone to check it out.

175
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,440
I'll keep an eye on it.

176
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,640
I'll keep an eye on it.

177
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,460
Lao'er,

178
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,180
what about your money?

179
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,020
Take it or leave it.

180
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,340
I'll put it right here.

181
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,420
Let's see what he can do to me.

182
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,980
- Let him come.
- Lao'er.

183
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,820
Go ahead.

184
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,940
Useless.

185
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,340
How's it going now?

186
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm fine, Mr. Xing.

187
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,220
I almost thought I was going to...

188
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
You scared me.

189
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,020
What exactly happened?

190
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,020
How did he end up firing the gun?

191
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,260
Fei Zai, the suspect
showed up at Wallace.

192
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,820
If you're still in the shop,

193
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,740
keep an eye on him,

194
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,060
but don't act rashly.

195
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,940
Thanks.

196
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,100
Alright.

197
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,860
Think again.

198
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,060
Apart from what we know,

199
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,300
does he have any other characteristics?

200
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,060
Every detail is important.

201
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,860
Mr. Xing,

202
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,020
I feel

203
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,340
that Sun Changhai

204
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,740
must be a ruthless person.

205
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,940
Look.

206
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,940
This burger shop

207
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,420
is full of customers.

208
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,020
In broad daylight,

209
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,140
he took the gun,

210
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,680
aimed at my forehead and fired.

211
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,740
If it weren't for my good reflexes,

212
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
you'd all be at my hometown
for a funeral feast by now.

213
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,380
Can you say something useful?

214
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,820
Mr. Xing,

215
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,620
I'm nervous.

216
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,100
I've told you

217
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,500
all I know.

218
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,620
Mr. Xing wants you
to say something useful.

219
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,940
Think harder.

220
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,340
What about eating then?

221
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,660
I remember now.

222
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,620
I recall he was

223
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,500
eating burgers like crazy.

224
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,340
And on his table,

225
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,340
there were probably

226
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,740
three or four

227
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,340
empty burger boxes

228
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,620
and two cups of orange juice.

229
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,060
I think he must be

230
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,300
a food enthusiast.

231
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,720
He likes sweet and sour flavors.

232
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,460
The table was full of ketchup.

233
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,220
I want something useful,

234
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,060
yet you're...

235
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,440
You're telling me this?

236
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,570
You really are a foodie.

237
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,660
That's still his characteristic.

238
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,260
Hello?

239
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,980
Don't go out these days.

240
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,460
After it settles down,

241
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,160
I'll arrange for you to leave.

242
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,860
Fei Zai's clue is really useful.

243
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,140
Everyone eats, drinks, and sleeps.

244
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,100
If we start with food...

245
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,340
Why are you still following me?

246
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm annoyed right now.

247
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
There's no need
to turn on me so quickly.

248
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,900
I had you watch Fei Zai

249
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,860
because I knew

250
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,820
you were friends.

251
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,260
Don't overthink it.

252
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,740
I don't understand.

253
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,120
At this critical moment,

254
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
finding the person is the priority.

255
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,820
What are you thinking about?

256
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,900
Wen Binbin,

257
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,380
it's our job to solve cases.

258
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,740
I don't want to see you

259
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,180
at any more crime scenes.

260
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,420
Alright.

261
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,780
If there's any difficulty,
don't have Fei Zai come to me.

262
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,220
I'll find people faster than you.

263
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,140
(Binjiang Public Security Bureau)

264
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,660
Mr. Xing.

265
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,260
Liu Yong, how's it going?

266
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,100
Mr. Xing,

267
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,220
we've got the burger shop's

268
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,060
delivery orders.

269
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,800
There are so many,
so it'll take some time.

270
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,180
Everyone, hold on a minute.

271
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,420
Here's the plan.

272
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,180
Let's focus on investigating those

273
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,100
with a simple flavor

274
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,300
but a large number.

275
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,420
Once we confirm the address,

276
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,420
Liu Yong,

277
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,900
go to the door at once.

278
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,220
Alright.

279
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,860
After a whole afternoon,

280
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,580
we haven't even found a trace.

281
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,180
Could it be

282
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,840
that he's slipped away
under our noses?

283
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,220
Don't you have sharp eyes?

284
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,400
They wouldn't have gotten away from you.

285
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,980
Why are you so down now?

286
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,140
Be confident.

287
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,660
Hello?

288
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
I saw you.

289
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,560
This is the item you ordered to pick up.

290
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,460
Okay.

291
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,740
One more thing.

292
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,100
(Public Security)

293
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,580
When you see this person,

294
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,900
call me immediately.

295
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,060
You have my number.

296
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,660
There'll be a reward for you.

297
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,500
Thanks.

298
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,420
Good luck.

299
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,100
Have you seen him? He has a mole.

300
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,540
Hello, sir. Your delivery.

301
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,900
Now tell me.

302
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,420
What exactly are you trying to pull?

303
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,540
This is a trap I've set,

304
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,500
waiting for a rabbit.

305
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,900
I think you're just daydreaming.

306
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,820
Waiting for a rabbit?

307
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,500
Wait a minute.

308
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,860
Hello?

309
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
OK, I'll come now. Send me the address.

310
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,900
What are you doing?

311
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,020
Come on. Can you tell me

312
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
what you are doing?

313
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,020
Is this the person?

314
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,060
He has a mole on his neck.

315
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,180
He told me to leave the things
at the door,

316
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,660
but I didn't see what he looked like.

317
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,500
However, the order he placed

318
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,020
was a large portion of fried chicken.

319
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,140
Alright, thank you.

320
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,220
Thank you, thank you.

321
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,220
Oh, I get it.

322
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,620
You already had a plan, right?

323
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,820
(Fei Zai)
You refused to tell me

324
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,780
to watch me get anxious.

325
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,660
Are you enjoying this?

326
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,060
Pretty much.

327
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,140
Don't sulk.

328
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,060
I'm just taking a gamble.

329
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,540
The police and our people

330
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,820
are surrounding him in layers.

331
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,020
It's like a steel barrel now.

332
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,260
He's not Sun Wukong.

333
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,440
How could he disappear?

334
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,260
So I was wondering if there was

335
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,300
a hideout for him nearby.

336
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,460
I got the delivery guys

337
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,380
to help us find it

338
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,660
and keep an eye out for clues.

339
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,260
They must know this area better than us.

340
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,420
So...

341
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,580
Right?

342
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,500
Mr. Xing,

343
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,580
the address

344
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,460
has been used to order

345
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,300
fried chicken,

346
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,500
roujiamo, and burgers.

347
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,700
They're all the same flavors

348
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,540
in large quantities.

349
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,220
It matches the suspect's profile.

350
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,300
I have to say.

351
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,500
Bin is really good

352
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,900
at solving cases.

353
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,580
We started with the delivery orders,

354
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,640
but Bin immediately went
for the delivery guys.

355
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,660
This kid

356
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,700
is indeed sharp.

357
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,780
Right.

358
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,820
Why are you so talkative?

359
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,820
Just drive.

360
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,000
The suspect has a gun.

361
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,380
Everyone, stay safe.

362
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
- Understood.
- Go.

363
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,500
(Police)

364
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,860
Let's go, Bin.

365
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,660
Why should I go? I'm not going.

366
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,640
The boss told you to go up.

367
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,700
I'm not going.

368
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,180
Mr. Xing told you to go up.

369
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,020
Hurry up.

370
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,200
You're more troublesome
than Zhuge Liang.

371
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,460
(Police)

372
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,260
Who cares to go?

373
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,660
What's going on?

374
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,980
Step back.

375
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,940
Mr. Xing, there's no one here.

376
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,840
Liu Yong,

377
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,860
seal off the area
and conduct a thorough search.

378
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Yes. Let's go.

379
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,420
Lao'er,

380
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,420
these are some small shareholders.

381
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,940
(Tuan Island Market's Shareholder List)
Flies are meat.

382
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,100
Let's take it slow.

383
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,660
Who should we start with?

384
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
(Li Ping)

385
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,050
Lao'er.

386
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,660
Li Ping, 0.2%.

387
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,000
(Li Ping)
Let's start with him.

388
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,100
What should we do?

389
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,020
Words or violence?

390
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,320
Words before violence.

391
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,140
What's his 0.2% stake worth?

392
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,050
200,000.

393
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,900
Give him 250,000.

394
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,020
No more than 300,000.

395
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,360
What if he doesn't agree?

396
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,180
If he doesn't agree,

397
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,020
you just make sure

398
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,380
to beat him up!

399
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,660
Alright.

400
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,420
How's it going, Li?

401
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,300
Mr. Xing,

402
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,640
he's obviously an old hand.

403
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,620
Even though he was in a hurry,

404
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,700
he didn't leave

405
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,720
any useful clues behind.

406
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,540
Mr. Xing.

407
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,060
Fei Zai, how's it going?

408
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,400
This is something Bin found.

409
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,660
He thinks it might be something
the suspect left behind.

410
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,020
He wanted us to see if it helped.

411
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
Where is he?

412
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,740
He's gone.

413
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,380
Thanks for the hard work.

414
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,020
Tell me.

415
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,020
Do you think this is reliable?

416
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,780
It must be reliable.

417
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,780
Da Pao said

418
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,580
he was very familiar with the gunman.

419
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,560
Since we can't find the gunman,

420
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,460
we have no choice but to find him.

421
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,660
I've said it before.

422
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,580
You can't trust your brother-in-law.

423
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,860
It's bad enough he's turning against us.

424
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,420
He could at least hold the guy down.

425
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
That's enough now.

426
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,340
Don't push your luck.

427
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,380
Do you think I want to find him?

428
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,260
The man has a gun.

429
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,200
We need someone with a gun
to handle him.

430
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,080
Or who do you want to put
in front of the gun?

431
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,100
You or Chen?

432
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
I'll go.

433
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,020
Alright.

434
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
You're a brave man
who's not afraid of death.

435
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,380
I just don't want
to sweep your tomb every year.

436
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,900
You think I don't want
to catch him myself?

437
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,920
I'd love to show off
in front of Xing Liang,

438
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,100
but my face

439
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,220
is nothing compared

440
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,820
to your lives.

441
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,620
I didn't mean it.

442
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,340
I'm telling you.

443
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,520
Tomorrow it's still going to be you two.

444
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,620
Got it?

445
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,180
Da, have you drunk too much tonight?

446
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,820
Drinking.

447
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,380
It's so exciting.

448
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,660
Not much.

449
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,860
I'll drink more later.

450
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,700
Drink more later.

451
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,540
Bro,

452
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,380
what's going on?

453
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,040
I came to chat with you.

454
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,140
Did you mistake me for someone else?

455
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,460
I didn't.

456
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,620
Lei Da, right?

457
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,100
Come with us.

458
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,980
Just chatting, huh?

459
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,620
Well, you two...

460
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,300
- You...
- Hey.

461
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,820
Stop.

462
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,100
Chase me, huh?

463
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,300
Come on, chase me.

464
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,100
Let's see what you two are up to.

465
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,700
What's the matter with you two?

466
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,780
What's going on?

467
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,620
Let's see what you're up to.

468
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,500
Wrong, wrong.

469
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,620
It's fake.

470
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,580
That gun is fake.

471
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,460
It's fake.

472
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,100
It's just to scare you.

473
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,020
Have you seen him before?

474
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,780
I know him.

475
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,660
Isn't that Wolf?

476
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,140
Well,

477
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,980
I met him

478
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,820
in Shenchuan.

479
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
We're from the same place.

480
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,860
We chatted a bit.

481
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,500
What's his real name?

482
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,820
I don't know.

483
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,380
Everyone just calls him Wolf,

484
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,700
or sometimes Coyote.

485
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,860
Sir,

486
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,340
if you have any grudges with him,

487
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,180
just go find him.

488
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,060
Don't come to me.

489
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,900
I'm not close to him.

490
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,220
Don't worry.

491
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,320
As long as you tell me
everything you know,

492
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,540
we won't touch you.

493
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,420
I don't know, sir.

494
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,900
I'm not close to him.

495
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,940
I've only met him a few times.

496
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,820
Have you met him in Binjiang?

497
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,820
Yes.

498
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,260
When?

499
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,780
About a week ago.

500
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,120
Does he have a place
to stay in Binjiang?

501
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,220
Can you contact him?

502
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,340
I don't know.

503
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,780
Let me tell you.

504
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,020
This guy's eyes are a bit off.

505
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,900
He scares people. I'm telling you.

506
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,580
We usually don't dare to talk to him.

507
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,740
Sir, I really don't know him well.

508
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,140
Don't come to me, sir.

509
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,460
You're not close to him,

510
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,180
but he seems pretty close to you.

511
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,760
He even arranged for someone
to take care of you.

512
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,820
What does that mean?

513
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
About what happened

514
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,180
at Birkin Paris Club that day,

515
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,780
he's been going around
spreading the word,

516
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,060
saying that you're the one who did it.

517
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,340
I didn't do it!

518
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,020
How could I, sir?

519
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,700
That jerk.

520
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,820
So sinister.

521
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,500
He's ruining me!

522
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,620
Sir, sir.

523
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,620
I just sell fake guns.

524
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,900
I didn't dare

525
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,820
to kill anyone. Really.

526
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,420
Then why did he choose

527
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,260
to frame you?

528
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,980
How would I know?

529
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,460
I didn't offend him.

530
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,060
I only sold him a fake gun.

531
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,700
I believe you,

532
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,780
but he used that gun to shoot a cop.

533
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,260
You know how serious this is.

534
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,620
If you want to clear yourself,

535
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,340
find Coyote.

536
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,220
How am I supposed to find him?

537
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,540
I don't even have his contact info.

538
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,020
Don't worry about me,

539
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,580
I'm perfectly fine here.

540
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,700
I saw the weather forecast.

541
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,100
It's going to get cold in Ninghai.

542
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,800
When you go out, make sure to bundle up.

543
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,420
Don't mess around and catch a cold.

544
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,260
Got it?

545
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,780
Alright, goodbye.

546
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,540
Your girlfriend?

547
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,900
My cousin.

548
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,860
He has a cousin

549
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,540
in Ninghai.

550
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,500
Ninghai.

551
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,030
Mr. Xing,

552
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,180
we found a hamburger wrapper

553
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,500
in the trash bag.

554
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,420
There was the suspect's saliva on it.

555
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,740
We've done a genetic extraction.

556
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,260
Once the report is out,

557
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,460
I'll take it,

558
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,820
along with what we've got
from Wallace,

559
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,220
and send it to Na Meng.

560
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,340
Also...

561
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,740
Mr. Xing,

562
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
take a look.

563
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,260
(Nickname Coyote, a cousin in Ninghai,
recently contacted.)

564
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,820
Bin's really impressive.

565
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,300
Isn't this like Conan
and Doraemon teaming up?

566
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,140
I just...

567
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,260
Here's the plan.

568
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,140
Send all the materials

569
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,580
you mentioned about the suspect

570
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,700
to the Beichun police as well,

571
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,740
and ask them for assistance.

572
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
I understand.

573
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,660
Go ahead.

574
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,420
Ping.

575
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,160
Why is the food on the ground?

576
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,940
I've got something

577
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,990
to talk to you about.

578
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,460
What about?

579
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,660
Let's talk inside, come on.

580
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,580
What are you doing?

581
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,620
Did you get the message?

582
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,140
It's too late; we'll talk tomorrow.

583
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,980
No, right now.

584
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,180
OK, I'll give you five minutes.

585
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,980
I want to know the progress.

586
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,340
What makes you confident

587
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,700
to make such a request?

588
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,780
I gave you all that information.

589
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,920
So you think you're so capable?

590
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,740
It's nothing,

591
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,380
but I can find

592
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,420
some things others can't.

593
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,780
So you think

594
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,840
you have the right
to negotiate with me?

595
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,940
Wen Binbin,

596
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,660
I thought from your performance today,

597
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,820
you'd learned something.

598
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,070
But now,

599
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,460
it's true what they say.

600
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,860
Old habits die hard.

601
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,580
I just don't understand.

602
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,700
What's wrong with us

603
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,820
cooperating on this case?

604
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,660
The credit is yours.

605
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,060
I'm not asking to get my job back.

606
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,360
I just want to get my gun back.

607
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,560
What did I do to offend you?

608
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,500
You're looking for the gun

609
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,660
to save face for yourself.

610
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,460
Don't come to me
if you can't find any leads.

611
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,100
What a joke.

612
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,940
Do you think

613
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,400
we can't solve the case without you?

614
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,560
You're so tough, huh?

615
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,620
The gunman

616
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,380
keeps slipping away
right under your nose.

617
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,660
Is that your skill?

618
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,100
Who lost the gun back then?

619
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,420
It's so late.

620
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,260
Feifei was asleep.

621
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,820
230,000.

622
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,820
That's quite a lot.

623
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,100
What do you think?

624
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,700
I'm not selling.

625
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,780
Say that again.

626
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,720
Are you selling or not?

627
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,580
Stop it.

628
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,900
Ping,

629
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,780
280,000.

630
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,800
That's a fair offer, right?

631
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,740
Don't be ungrateful.

632
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,660
I'm not selling.

633
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,020
Selling or not?

634
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,570
What are you doing?

635
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,340
What's going on?

636
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,420
What are you doing?

637
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,220
Don't move.

638
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,340
You are

639
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,660
a leader outside.

640
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,880
Why are you so scared
of your wife at home?

641
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,340
She told you to stay here,

642
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,520
so you really plan
to sit here quietly all night?

643
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,660
You can leave if you want.

644
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,680
No one's stopping you.

645
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,300
I just find it strange.

646
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,340
My sister always liked people
with personality.

647
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,740
No matter how

648
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,380
I look at you,

649
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,100
you don't seem like the type she'd like.

650
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,280
After all these years,
she hasn't divorced you.

651
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,620
How do you know

652
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,920
she hasn't thought about it?

653
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,920
My sister wanted to divorce you?

654
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,020
When did this happen?

655
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,880
How come I didn't know?

656
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,940
When you were suspended.

657
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,860
Oh, my sister.

658
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,980
What's that got to do with you?

659
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,000
After all,

660
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,620
it's my fault for being careless

661
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,020
and letting this accident happen.

662
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,220
What if it wasn't an accident?

663
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,260
What do you mean?

664
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,580
What if it was a setup

665
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,460
that you lost your gun?

666
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,220
The gun

667
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,740
was sealed for two months.

668
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
Once it goes off,

669
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,260
it's unstoppable.

670
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,140
I think

671
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,860
you should hurry up.

672
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,460
Think carefully.

673
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,780
Have you offended anyone?

674
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,620
Could anyone have been

675
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,020
working behind your back,

676
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,900
taking your gun?

677
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,460
Even when I fought with people,

678
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,940
it was just small-time stuff,

679
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,470
but my gun went missing
on your second day in office.

680
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,140
Could it have something to do with you?

681
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,400
Absolutely not.

682
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,540
Why then?

683
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,960
Then why did they choose me

684
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,920
