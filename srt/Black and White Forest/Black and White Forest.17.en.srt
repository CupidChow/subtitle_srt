- Here.

7

(Zhan Xiaoman, youth)
My mom made taro cake.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,000
It doesn't taste good once it's cold.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,120
Hurry up and eat.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,400
My sister wouldn't fill it so full.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,360
You gave me yours again, right?

13

When you delivered food before,

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,720
I knew you would do this.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,040
I didn't tell my sister,

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
but you can't keep doing this.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
You gave up studying for me.

18

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,080
how can I live with myself?

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm stupid.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,400
I can't study well.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,680
My mom said

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,520
our family would rely on you
from now on.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,700
If you do well in the exams,

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,840

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,400
But my surname is Zhan,

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,320

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,760

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,480
and you grew up in our family.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,160
You only have us as your family.

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
We are one family.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,640
You're right.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,960
We'll always be one family.

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,040
I'll give you half of the taro cake.

36

Let's share it, okay?

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,180
If you give it to me, I'll throw it away

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,260
and give it to the dog.

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,260
I'll eat.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,080

87
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,740
I don't understand.

What does this have to do with me?

89
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,900
Sorry for not explaining it clearly.

90
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,730
Someone wanted to express sincerity

91
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,700
and gave you a big gift.

92
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,020

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,740
to transfer all his shares

192
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,580
of Benniu Group

193
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,260
to MorningStar Group.

194
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,700
Here's the share transfer agreement

195
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,340
signed by both parties.

196
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,260
(Share Transfer Agreement)

197
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,780
After our group took over,

198
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,020
we immediately evaluated
the Tuan Island project.

199
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,900
The evaluation confirmed

200
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,380
that the original bid

201
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,180
from Benniu Group still stands.

202
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,220
Wasn't this share transfer agreement

203
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,380
handed to your company?

204
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,340
Mr. Wang,

205
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,420
the share transfer agreement we have

206
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,020
was indeed written by Mr. Chen Mingyuan,

207
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,260
the actual controller of Benniu Group.

208
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,980
As for the one

209
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
in MorningStar Group's hands,

210
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,020
we cannot

211
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,740
verify its authenticity.

212
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,260
Ms. Wen is right.

213
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,780
Until the real one is revealed,

214
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,540
the fake will usually
be treated as real.

215
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,780
(Bid Opening Meeting)

216
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,620
Mr. Wang,

217
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,760
your bidding process is normal.

218
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,600
I understand that.

219
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,900
But now

220
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,060
we have two share transfer agreements.

221
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,380
I believe

222
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,980
that in the interest
of fairness and justice,

223
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,180
and in the interest

224
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,300
of Benniu Group,

225
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,140
MorningStar Group,

226
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,060
and even Wen Group,

227
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,140
the authenticity

228
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,460
of these documents

229
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,540
should be verified first,

230
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,760
before deciding the outcome of the bid.

231
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,700
This

232
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,500
has never happened before.

233
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,020
Sorry, I need to take this call.

234
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,420
What do you think?

235
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,020
Such a surprise, huh?

236
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,340
I'm not friends with Dian Lao'er,

237
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,540
but I do know

238
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,060
he doesn't have partners of your level.

239
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,940
Here, there are no friends or enemies.

240
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,180
Everyone is doing business.

241
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,140
I haven't seen Mr. Qi for a long time.

242
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,060
Please send him my regards.

243
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,700
As for the transfer agreement,

244
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,020
the truth will come out sooner or later.

245
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,060
Everyone,

246
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,510
due to the unexpected situation
with Benniu Group,

247
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,820
the city leadership

248
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,800
and the bidding committee have decided

249
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,100
the announcement of the result

250
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,220
will be delayed.

251
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,170
Well,

252
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,580
see you on the business front.

253
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,460
Because of Chen Mingyuan's death,

254
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,390
the meeting was postponed.

255
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,140
Chen Yiming,

256
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,400
what exactly are you hiding?

257
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,500
Who is behind this?

258
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,400
Where is the gun?

259
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,300
Take him away.

260
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,140
From our rise to today,

261
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,300
we've been brothers for over ten years.

262
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,540
I don't believe

263
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,140
Big Eye Chen is that kind of person.

264
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,540
Chen seems normal most of the time.

265
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,100
It's about desire.

266
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,700
He wants too much

267
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,980
but gets too little,

268
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,060
so it's easy for him to be used.

269
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,060
Anyway, I don't think
there's anything wrong with Chen.

270
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,980
Dian Lao'er and Ajin

271
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,500
deserve to die, right?

272
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,780
Bin,

273
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,980
the last time you fought with Ajin,

274
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,820
if Chen hadn't arrived in time,

275
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,660
wouldn't you have...

276
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,020
And last night.

277
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,900
Chen had a knife in his hand.

278
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,100
With his skills and your small frame,

279
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,140
if he wanted to kill you,

280
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,540
could you still be standing here?

281
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,220
I think Chen just wanted to avenge us.

282
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,620
He just used the wrong method.

283
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,740
It's no big deal.

284
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,580
The one Chen had was

285
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,540
a police gun.

286
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,100
It was the one I lost.

287
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,580
Who gave it to him?

288
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,220
Who instructed him?

289
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,020
Bin's right.

290
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,300
That police gun

291
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,780
is very suspicious.

292
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
I think the person who set us up

293
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,300
must be close to us.

294
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,230
- How's it going?
- Mr. Xing, sit down.

295
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,260
This is the account under his name.

296
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,520
For the past year, every month,

297
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,680
there's been a large deposit.

298
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,860
(Transaction History
Account Name: Cai Jinhua)

299
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,740
That's not right.

300
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,420
This account is

301
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Cai Jinhua's.

302
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,340
Who is Cai Jinhua?

303
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,980
She's Cai Jinhua.

304
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,680
She's at the stage 6 of Alzheimer's.

305
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,780
She's almost incapable of self-care.

306
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,260
She usually relies on a caregiver

307
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,540
to take care of her 24/7.

308
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,220
Where did her money come from?

309
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,720
Do her relatives visit her often?

310
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,580
She's been living here
for about five or six years

311
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,700
and has no close relatives.

312
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,380
Someone used to come
and pay her nursing fees

313
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,240
(Expense List; On-site Payment)
every month.

314
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,740
In the last year,

315
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,860
they've been deducted
from her bank account.

316
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,880
Is this the person who paid her fees?

317
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,540
No, it was a woman.

318
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Quite young, actually.

319
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,220
A woman?

320
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,860
Chen Yiming's father

321
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,780
passed away when he was very young.

322
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,220
He has an older brother

323
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,580
who died in an accident

324
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,900
at the mine.

325
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,640
So, aside from his mother, Cai Jinhua,

326
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,820
he has no other relatives.

327
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,300
(Cai Jinhua)
Seven years ago,

328
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,740
he married a woman from Anhui,

329
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,100
but they divorced

330
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,420
after just two years.

331
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,180
Cai Jinhua is Chen Yiming's mother.

332
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,860
Did you find out

333
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,040
who transferred money
into Cai Jinhua's account?

334
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,420
Yu.

335
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,900
This is very strange.

336
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,380
Cai Jinhua's money

337
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,180
is mostly from merchant refunds

338
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,100
and overseas online gambling payments.

339
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,660
I can't trace the source at all.

340
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,940
Merchant refunds?

341
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,060
What does that mean?

342
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,180
Does Cai Jinhua own any businesses?

343
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,100
No businesses.

344
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,860
Let me give you an example, Mr. Xing.

345
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,040
For example,
I have two bottles of good wine.

346
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,100
I bring them to a recycling store.

347
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,840
The money from selling the wine

348
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,710
is transferred
through the merchant's account

349
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,080
into Cai Jinhua's account.

350
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,740
It's all prearranged.

351
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,340
Including the overseas
online gambling platforms.

352
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,810
They all use domestic

353
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,090
black-market individuals

354
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,020
to transfer the money.

355
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,820
It's textbook for money laundering
of online scams.

356
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,580
Fei Zai.

357
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,360
Keep tracing the source.

358
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,940
If necessary,

359
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,780
ask the Economic Crime Department
for help.

360
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,620
Got it.

361
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,900
Now someone is using Big Eye Chen
to deal with us.

362
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,660
With the delay of the meeting,

363
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,220
I think these two things

364
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,020
are actually

365
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,220
the same thing behind the scenes.

366
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,620
Uncle Man makes a good point.

367
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,500
Bao,

368
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,740
Chen was caught.

369
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,020
We can follow this lead further.

370
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,780
Bao,

371
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,820
Mr. Xing is here.

372
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,700
He wants to see you.

373
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,540
Sir.

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,860
Welcome.

375
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,900
What would you two like to buy?

376
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,970
We're not here to buy anything.

377
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,140
We've come to sell you something.

378
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,780
I see.

379
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,100
You see.

If you two need cash urgently,

I can also offer

You really cover a lot of services.

388
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,100
You've got all gray areas.

389
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,500
Sir,

390
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,740
what do you mean by that?

391
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,170
(Police)
We're from the CIU.

392
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,580
We need to ask you a few questions.

393
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,360
Please show us the surveillance footage.

394
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,820
Oh, this.

395
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,980
No problem.

396
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,180
Officers,

397
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,300
this is all brand new,

398
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,420

399
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,580
and no blind spots.

400
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,760
Enough talking, hurry up.

401
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,820
Yes, yes.

402
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,740
Big Eye Chen

403
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,580
is my man.

404
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,420
I give him money,
and he does things for me.

405
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,700
But now he's in trouble.

406
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Would he tell me

407
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,800
what crime he's committed?

408
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,380
Could he even tell me?

409
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,420
You don't have to care
about Chen Yiming,

410
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,540
but he cares about you.

411
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,260
It's normal for him to care about me.

412
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,080
He's my brother.

413
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,680
He doesn't even care about his own life,

414
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,020
but he's still worried
about whether you'll win the bid.

415
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,910
What does that mean?

416
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,600
I don't think Big Eye Chen
can plot this.

417
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
But can you?

418
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,140
Do you think this is just your problem?

419
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,920
Don't forget
it also involves Xuan and Bin.

420
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,060
Hello?

421
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
Bin.

422
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,580
Come here.

423
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,840
Bring Er'leng with you.

424
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,380
Hurry up.

(Surveillance

426
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,480
Look, right here.

427
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,440
Look, it's this woman.

428
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Are you sure it's her?

429
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,260
Of course.

430
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,140
She left me a strong impression.

431
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,700
Look at the time: October 16,

432
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,140
at 3:58 PM.

433
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,380
I have a transfer record.

434
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
I'll show you.

435
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,740
Here, look.

436
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,540
Right?

437
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,680
The reason why I remember her

438
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,780
is the stuff I usually buy

439
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,100
is small-time,

440
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,540
nothing big.

441
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,460
But not her.

442
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,620
Every time she came,
it was either Chunghwa or Maotai

443
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,900
and always sold in full boxes.

444
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,440
I couldn't forget her.

445
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,700
(Overseas Remittance,
Interbank Transfer, Merchant Refund)

446
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,820
I'm telling you.

447
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,340
As for him,

448
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,620
he thinks that his mother

449
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,260
has no relatives,

450
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,380
not even distant ones.

451
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,740
But

452
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,180
he's quite filial.

453
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,540
Every month,

454
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,200
he sends money to the nursing home.

455
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,080
I've helped him
deliver it several times.

456
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,740
I'm a good person.

457
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,700
Besides you,

458
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
who else has sent money for him?

459
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,730
I'm not sure.

460
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,380
I really don't know.

461
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,820
Though he's usually careless,

462
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,900
whenever it comes to his mother,

463
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,420
he's very cautious.

464
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,350
Well.

465
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,020
Does that include his girlfriends?

466
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,980
Let me think...

467
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,180
Tingting.

468
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,140
Jingjing.

469
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,380
As for Hui,

470
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,940
I'm not sure.

471
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,430
Why not?

472
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,760
How should I explain this?

473
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,300
Bao.

474
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,220
Why look at me?

475
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,020
Hurry up and say it.

476
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,660
Okay, I'll say it.

477
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,820
One night before,

478
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,300
he asked me out for drinks.

479
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,420
He pestered me the whole night,

480
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,740
asking to borrow money.

481
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,980
Of course,

482
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,220
I asked him why.

483
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,020
He said that Hui

484
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,080
was tested positive.

485
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,780
She was pregnant.

486
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,380
She wanted to use the baby

487
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,740
to trade for a house.

488
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,740
This isn't his usual style.

489
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,460
He usually takes care of things
like this

490
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,140
at the hospital.

491
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,220
It's different this time.

492
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,740
Your Hui is from Northeast China,

493
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,560
but the one I'm talking about
is from Fuchang.

494
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,780
It's true love this time.

495
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,620
True love.

496
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,900
Is this her?

497
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,860
That's her.

498
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,140
Her forehead is especially big.

499
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,320
It's easy to recognize her.

500
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
What's her name?

501
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,100
I think this woman

502
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,180
is very important in this case.

503
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,980
Bin,

504
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,100
you should join the investigation.

505
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,420
Eat an apple.

506
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,580
You can't violate

507
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,460
the discipline.

508
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,140
Wen Binbin,

509
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,260
disciplinary violations

510
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,300
are not allowed.

511
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,300
This police officer scared me to death.

512
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,860
He looks pretty fierce.

513
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,100
Did you hear that clearly?

514
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,740
You can't violate the discipline,

515
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,120
but if it's not a violation,
then it's fine.

516
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,200
- I'm leaving.
- Sure.

517
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,580
Bao, have some.

518
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,460
How's it going?

519
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,460
Everything's going according to plan.

520
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,420
This isn't Shenchuan.

521
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,220
A strong dragon
can't suppress a local snake.

522
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,460
Make sure to give
the necessary greetings.

523
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Make sure everything

524
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,700
is well taken care of.

525
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,220
Rest assured.

526
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,460
Everyone involved

527
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,860
will be properly arranged.

528
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,340
The candidates are very nice.

529
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,060
That's good.

530
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,860
As of now, this matter

531
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,500
is only halfway through.

532
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,940
It's still at a critical point.

533
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,200
We need to be cautious.

534
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,420
Don't let anything
that shouldn't be known get out,

535
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,220
not even one word.

536
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,580
OK.

537
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,660
Luo Jiahui is 26

538
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,780
(Household Register)
from Fuchang.

539
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,420
She works at Xiyuehui KTV,

540
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,620
and she's Chen Yiming's lover.

541
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,100
According to information provided

542
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,780
by the Maternal
and Child Health Hospital,

543
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,340
she's 36 weeks pregnant,

544
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,680
and almost due to give birth.

545
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,940
To get Chen Yiming to talk,

546
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,500
Luo Jiahui is the key.

547
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,770
Yes.

548
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,780
Mr. Xing.

549
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,500
Mr. Xing.

550
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,340
We found Luo Jiahui's address.

551
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,460
Kaitai Community.

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,940
(Siji International Hotel)

553
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,980
Mr. Wang.

554
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,140
Sorry, everyone.

555
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,820
The traffic was terrible, so I was late.

556
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,600
You're too polite.

557
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,760
There's traffic at this hour.

558
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,740
We just arrived too.

559
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,780
Hello, Mr. Wang.

560
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,630
Hello, hello.

561
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,020
Mr. Wang, nice to meet you.

562
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Hello, everyone.

Xuan,

564
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,700
long time no see.

565
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,940
Long time no see.

566
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,600
I was having tea with Mr. Wang.

567
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,220
I heard you were having a banquet here,

568
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,100
so I shamelessly came
to join you for a meal.

569
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,300
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

570
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Xuan already sent her regards from afar,

571
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,140
so I had to come visit personally.

572
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,940
Since you're here personally,

573
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,140
we'll make sure
to take good care of you.

574
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,320
We're having a private gathering.

575
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,000
It's about feelings, not business.

576
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,260
Who is this?

577
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,500
I'm Tu Manjiang.

578
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,500
He's in charge
of the Tuan Island project.

579
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,660
Oh, you're Mr. Tu.

580
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,940
Nice to meet you.

581
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,050
I've heard a lot about you.

582
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,980
Let's sit down and chat.

583
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,600
- Come on.
- Please, sit down.

584
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,020
Why did you bring a weapon?

585
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,740
I told you we were looking for someone.

586
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,420
Can you think before you act?

587
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,040
I'll check the surveillance footage.

588
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,380
You two go to the intersection.

589
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,500
If you see anyone, ask them.

590
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,000
Okay.

591
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,140
Why are you everywhere?

592
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,140
What are you here for?

593
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,100
What do you mean?

594
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,060
I dropped something in this community.

595
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,460
Is it wrong to come look for it?

596
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,300
Arrest me if I can't.

597
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,220
Do you think I won't arrest you?

598
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,620
What did you lose?

599
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,180
A pair of shoes.

600
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,700
Wen Binbin,

601
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,260
Mr. Xing told you.

602
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,180
You can't violate the discipline.

603
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,620
Like last night,

604
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,840
if anything happened to you,

605
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,120
could you take responsibility?

606
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,820
Could you bear the responsibility?

607
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,900
And you.

608
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,660
Do you know Luo Jiahui?

609
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,260
Come in with me.

610
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,020
What? Come in with me.

611
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,380
You two go do your job.

612
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,220
You also come in. Lock the door.

613
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,180
Let's all watch it.

614
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,480
It's just the surveillance.

615
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,410
Close the door.

616
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,740
This is an old community.

617
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,660
The parking lot surveillance
has been broken.

618
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,200
They can't afford replacement.

619
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,940
There's only one camera here.

620
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,740
(Surveillance; Main Gate)
Stop.

621
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,620
Come here.

622
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,140
Is the woman sitting
in the passenger seat

623
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:08,830
Luo Jiahui?

624
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,900
Yes.

625
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,880
That's her.

626
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:13,970
Xuan,

627
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,120
the last time we met

628
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,840
was when I went
to visit Uncle Wen, right?

629
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,540
It's been over ten years now.

630
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,620
Yeah.

631
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,740
My daughter's already in middle school.

632
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,940
I never imagined

633
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,220
you'd be so impressive now.

634
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,860
You're rising rapidly in business.

635
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,690
Now you have such a big enterprise.

636
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,980
Compared to Uncle Wen, I'm far behind.

637
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,100
Uncle Wen is truly outstanding.

638
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,340
Starting from here
at Tuan Island Market,

639
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,460
in just over a decade,

640
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,980
the Wen family's enterprises

641
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,500
have spread across all of China.

642
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,620
Any profitable business

643
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,900
has the Wen family's presence.

644
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,980
Even my father,
when he talks about Uncle Wen,

645
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,980
it's filled with respect

646
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,380
and also jealousy.

647
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,700
Tuan Island Market

648
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,780
is where our family started.

649
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,940
It's the place with the most sentiment.

650
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,820
Do you really want to take it from us?

651
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,140
Back then,

652
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,980
you knew I liked you,

653
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,420
but you never looked at me.

654
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,340
You turned around and dated Mr. Xing.

655
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,410
Mr. Qi,

656
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,710
let me interrupt.

657
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,040
Business and feelings
are two different things.

658
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,880
Feelings have no reason,

659
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,930
but business has rules.

660
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,780
No, no.

661
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,000
Actually, they are the same.

662
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,500
Neither of these things
has a clear order,

663
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,900
but both rely on impulsion.

664
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,380
What's more,

665
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,500
we used to suffer the same fate.

666
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,720
No,

667
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,020
Mr. Qi, we were not the same.

668
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,120
We didn't suffer the same fate.

669
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,380
As for me,

670
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,940
my friends in the underworld flatter me

671
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,750
and call me "Bao",

672
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,820
but in reality,

673
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,120
I was just the old man's driver.

674
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,780
I did like Zixuan back then.

675
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,800
Everyone knew it.

676
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,600
How can a toad

677
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,260
eat swan meat?

678
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,340
Right?

679
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,070
But you were different.

680
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,340
Mr. Qi.

681
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,280
You're good-looking

682
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,620
and have connections.

683
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,200
What happened to you?

684
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,870
You didn't win her over either.

685
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,580
We adults

686
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,020
only value the outcome,

687
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,580
not the process.

688
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,700
From the outcome,

689
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,400
we used to suffer the same fate.

690
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,300
We're both toads.

691
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,860
Come in.

692
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,420
Mr. Xing,

693
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,460
we found the vehicle info.

694
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,180
It's registered
under the name of Benniu Group.

695
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,140
Dian Lao'er's company?

696
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,980
Yes.

697
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,320
Hurry up. Track the car.
Find the target.

698
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,180
Yes.

699
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,380
I heard from our Xing Liang

700
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,820
that you're dead set
on the Tuan Island project.

701
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,480
Did Mr. Xing tell you

702
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,980
I must secure

703
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,260
the Tuan Island project

704
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,380
even if I don't want to?

705
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,900
Mr. Qi,

706
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,140
you sound like it's almost certain now.

707
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,530
In business,

708
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,830
there's no such thing as almost certain.

709
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,620
But

710
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,510
we've all gotten support

711
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,550
from Dian Lao'er's shares,

712
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,000
which gives us more advantage.

713
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,820
The shares were given to two companies.

714
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,820
In business,

715
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,340
the order doesn't matter,

716
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,060
but the truth matters, right?

717
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,420
Ms. Wen makes a point.

718
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,780
There's even a fake Monkey King.

719
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,300
Come on, bro.

720
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,380
Tell me where we are going.

721
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,300
The car is almost out of gas.

722
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,300
I'm thinking.

723
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,740
Thinking of what?

724
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Dian Lao'er is like a turtle.

725
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,760
He won't leave us alone
even after death.

726
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,860
Among us,

727
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,790
who knows

728
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,060
anyone from his crew?

729
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,420
Who do we know?

730
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,740
Where can we find them?

731
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,740
What about that guy
you fooled last time, Xizai?

732
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
We can go look for him.

733
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,580
Don't mention it.

734
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,860
I went too far.

735
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,720
He wanted to fight with Shuigui,

736
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,340
and now they're both in jail.

737
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,220
How stupid.

738
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,180
So, what do we do now?

739
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,620
Hai...

740
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,860
What Hai?

741
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,700
Who's that?

742
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,260
The one who guarded Dian Lao'er's wake.

743
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,500
Didn't you say

744
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,940
he had loyalty?

745
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,580
Right, I remember now.

746
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,670
When we were looking

747
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,820
for Wu at the pier,

748
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,430
he was the old guy
who yelled the loudest, right?

749
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,180
He should be
one of Dian Lao'er's old hands.

750
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,500
If someone from their company

751
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
kidnapped Luo Jiahui,

752
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,260
he should know them, right?

753
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,300
(Chaohu Road, Tongjiang Road,
Xinhe, Beihai)

754
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,460
Found it.

755
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,540
(Surveillance; Lianhua Intersection)
Hai AH5651.

756
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,620
At 10:28 AM.

757
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,060
It passed through Chongtian Avenue

758
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,900
from south to north.

759
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,780
Being able to trace the lead
is a good thing.

760
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,300
- Keep tracing it.
- Yes.

761
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,380
Two homicides, one injury case,

762
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,900
and the missing police gun.

763
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,300
Now all the clues

764
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,780
are pointing to Chen Yiming.

765
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,860
Also, Tuan Island

766
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,460
looks like

767
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,620
a simple business project,

768
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,600
but there must be something behind it.

769
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,540
To find out what it is,

770
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,160
we have to force him to talk.

771
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,420
Xing,

772
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,940
the Provincial Department's deadline

773
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,380
is today.

774
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,140
If we get nothing at the deadline,

775
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,380
the steering group will come.

776
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,780
The steering group

777
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,820
will only care about the shooting case.

778
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,300
But the shooting case is just
a shadow of Tuan Island.

779
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,460
Tuan Island is the true goal
behind the shooting case.

780
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,420
So,

781
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,140
we have to interrogate Chen Yiming.

782
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,340
Actually,

783
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,560
from a human nature standpoint,

784
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,700
I think Luo Jiahui

785
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,730
is a breakthrough point.

786
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,220
More precisely, it's her baby.

787
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,940
I've seen Chen Yiming's files.

788
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,340
The child is the trigger
for his divorce,

789
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,740
and it's also his emotional burden.

790
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,780
Uncle Hai.

791
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,220
Why can't you understand?

792
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,820
This thing has nothing to do

793
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,700
with Dian Lao'er's death.

794
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,540
You won't be affected.

795
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,980
Bin,

796
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,940
stop lying to me.

797
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,060
The police have also told me

798
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,380
it has nothing to do with me.

799
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,220
But

800
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,100
I've been to the police station

801
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,620
eight times.

802
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,380
My wife thinks I'm cheating on her.

803
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,860
She checks my phone every day.

804
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,870
She won't let me

805
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,500
carry a single penny in my pocket now.

806
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,860
She even wants me to release

807
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,020
the female fish I caught.

808
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,100
I really don't know anyone.

809
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,180
I only know fish.

810
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,900
I don't even know the female fish.

811
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,740
Just leave.

812
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,980
You said the police

813
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,140
had come to you eight times, right?

814
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,860
I even paid

815
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,860
for the drive.

816
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,620
Let me be frank with you.

817
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,700
This has nothing

818
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,900
to do with Dian Lao'er,

819
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,420
but the police

820
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,620
are also looking for this person.

821
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,300
It's me here now.

822
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,860
If you don't tell me,

823
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,460
then the police will come again.

824
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,100
Anyway, it's fine for you.

825
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,380
With your leg condition,

826
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,300
you can just walk a few more times.

827
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,220
I think it's fine.

828
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,940
Wait, wait.

829
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,780
Bin,

830
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,740
will the police come for me again?

831
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
As for the person

832
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
on your phone,

833
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,060
he's from the company.

834
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,620
His name is Scar Liu.

835
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,420
He was a card dealer under Dian Lao'er

836
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,180
in Shenchuan.

837
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,060
Uncle Hai,

838
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,460
can you get in touch with him?

839
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,660
Okay.

840
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
Uncle Hai, I got it.

841
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,260
I didn't show you anything,

842
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,780
and I didn't tell you anything.

843
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,620
- Okay.
- Listen to me.

844
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,940
Don't come to me

845
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,460
unless necessary.

846
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,940
Even if it's necessary,
try not to contact me.

847
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,220
Thank you, Uncle Hai.

848
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,580
I'm leaving.

849
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,660
Let's go.

850
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,020
Let's go.

851
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,220
Hello, Bin.

852
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,780
Really?

853
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,440
Send over the info, and we'll check it.

854
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,420
Okay.

855
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,740
- Boss.
- What's going on?

856
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,180
Bin found his information

857
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,060
and phone number.

858
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,060
What?

859
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,640
The West Suburb Shantytown?

860
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,300
Are you sure?

861
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,340
(Mr. Xing)
Yes.

862
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,620
We tracked the phone number

863
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,060
based on Bin's info.

864
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,160
The target is
in the West Suburb Shantytown.

865
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,640
We also found the car.

866
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,660
(Surveillance)
Mr. Xing,

867
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,500
we found the car.

868
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,100
It's near the Lianhua Intersection

869
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,500
from south to north.

870
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,620
Okay, I'm on my way.

871
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,020
We don't know how dangerous

872
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,860
the suspect is yet.

873
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,180
Notify the local police station

874
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,380
and call for backup.

875
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,860
Also,

876
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,440
contact the emergency center.

877
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,180
Tell them
about the pregnant woman.

878
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,060
Have an ambulance on standby.

879
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,420
Got it.

880
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,700
Liu Sixi!

881
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,100
- Stop!
- Stop!

882
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,100
Stop running! Catch him!

883
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,260
Stop!

884
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,300
Don't move.

885
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,620
What's your name?

886
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,620
Liu Sixi.

887
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,540
Cuff him.

888
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,020
- Ouch, ouch!
- Where is Luo Jiahui?

889
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,380
In that room.

890
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,980
Lead the way.

891
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,420
Hurry and call an ambulance.

892
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,760
What happened to Hui and the baby?

893
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,620
Tell me!

894
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,540
What happened to Hui and the baby?

895
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,140
Now you're worried?

896
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
Where were you earlier?

897
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,060
When you were taking the fall
for others,

898
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,460
did anyone think of you?

899
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,260
Drug use, theft,

900
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,260
intentional harm,

901
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,100
and even illegal gambling.

902
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,780
Liu Sixi,

903
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,020
you have quite a record.

904
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,020
The police are too strong.

905
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
What can I do?

906
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,700
Intentional harm.

907
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,500
The victim is even pregnant.

908
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,120
Do you think
you're doing the right thing?

909
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,260
Do you understand the consequences?

910
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,220
I understand.

911
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,780
The consequence is

912
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,100
I won't get the final payment.

913
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,260
It's a girl.

914
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,220
Five jin and seven liang.

915
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,620
Very healthy.

916
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,580
The baby's condition is good,

917
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,060
but

918
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,980
the mother's situation isn't optimistic.

919
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
She was kidnapped,

920
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,460
suffered severe shock,

921
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,460
and was beaten and abused.

922
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,020
She had severe bleeding during delivery

923
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,500
and is still in a coma.

924
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,740
Chen Yiming,

925
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,300
what happened today

926
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,500
is the best of the worst.

927
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,140
If you continue to refuse

928
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,340
to tell us the truth,

929
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,660
a tragedy

930
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,240
will definitely happen again.

931
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,860
I killed

932
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,540
Ajin

933
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,980
and Dian Lao'er.

934
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,260
Where is the gun?

935
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,380
In the ditch near Dawang Village.

936
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,860
About 300 meters north

937
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,620
of the bridge.

938
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,700
♪The moon is surrounded by stars♪

939
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,130
