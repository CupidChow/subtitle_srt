00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,300
(Twelve years ago)

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,220
Can you stop breathing so loud?

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,020
Bro.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,580
The Wens are so cunning.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,500
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,540
If we can survive this time,

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,420
when I'm back,

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,760
I'll teach them a hard lesson.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,740
Otherwise, I won't forgive myself.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,820
What if someone comes here
to take a dump?

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,020
We shouldn't visit your father
at this point.

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,900
Nothing has happened tonight.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,020
I don't know

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,580
if we can come back alive,

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,940
so I have to

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,820
say goodbye to my father.

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,420
Dad.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,220
(Younger Xing Liang)

19
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,620
Zeng, run!

20
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,460
Go!

21
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,260
Run!

22
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
Don't move!

23
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,500
Hands in the air!

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,700
Stop!

25
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,660
Zeng!

26
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,780
Run!

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,260
Zeng!

28
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,580
Run!

29
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,860
- Stop!
- Run!

30
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,820
Sir.

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,260
Dad!

32

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,100

34
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:36,180
(Police)

35
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,700
Mr. Xing, it's been two hours.

36
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,420
It's a stagnant stream

37
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,300
with a lot of mud.

38
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,140
It's hard to find it.

39
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,580
I'm sure

40
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,220
Chen Yiming didn't lie this time.

41
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,500
Find it.

42
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,580
We must find it

43
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,860
at all costs.

44
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Yes.

45
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,340
I know what's going on out there.

46
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,060
Stay at your post.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,780
I'll take care of

48
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,620
the money and labor.

49
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,060
Okay.

50
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,460
Let me speak to Director Sun.

51
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,980
Mr. Xing, I've never seen Mr. Tai

52
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,260
work so efficiently.

53
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,780
You still don't know this guy.

54
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,340
He's always excited about

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,060
and good at making

56
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,500
a last-minute effort.

57
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,060
Mr. Xing, found it!

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,860
Liu Yong, let's go.

59
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,140
Mr. Xing, we found the gun!

60
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,020
Mr. Xing!

61
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,380
Liu Yong.

62
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,700
Let them identify it.

63
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,540
Okay.

64
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,460
(Seek Innovation,
Take on Responsibility)

65
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,380
What took them so long?

66
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,390
It's been a while.

67
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,740
Can you be more patient?

68
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,620
Boss,

69
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,900
I'm sure it's Bin's gun.

70
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,620
You never know.

71
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,180
If it's not his gun,

72
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,620
he'll be exiled again,

73
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,900
and we'll be

74
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,020
scolded by the steering group.

75
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,180
Look at Mr. Xing.

76
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,660
Stay calm.

77
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,500
If I could do it,

78
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,420
I'd be your boss.

79
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,780
(Identification)

80
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,620
Mr. Xing,

81
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,980
according to the test results,

82
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,300
it's Binbin's gun.

83
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,820
No. 952776 police gun.

84
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,620
Thanks, Wang.

85
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,460
You're welcome.

86
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,860
Thanks.

87
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,900
Thanks.

88
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,460
I'll get back to work.

89
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,340
No problem.

90
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,920
Are you sure?

91
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,700
Okay, I got it.

92
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,900
Bye.

93
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,020
Secretary Ji,

94
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,780
good news.

95
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,220
We found the gun.

96
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
Yes.

97
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Xing Liang worked closely

98
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,860
with other departments

99
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,580
and found it

100
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,340
in the last minute.

101
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,460
I'm glad we didn't let you down.

102
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,900
Otherwise,

103
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,820
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.

104
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,740
Not a big deal. It's our duty.

105
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,060
Okay, bye.

106
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,540
What are you doing?

107
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,780
Want to be punished?

108
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,700
No. Mr. Xing,

109
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,580
I just want to send it to Bin

110
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,940
and make him happy.

111
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,380
Besides,

112
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,140
(No. 952776 police gun.)
it's his gun.

113
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
He's suspended.

114
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,580
It's not a violation of discipline.

115
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,020
It's definitely a violation.

116
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,860
Do you want to be suspended too?

117
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,700
No.

118
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,940
You can't think of

119
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,980
another way except for a photo?

120
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Fei Zai, look at you.

121
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,540
You must've lost your brain
while losing weight.

122
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,620
What does that mean?

123
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,900
Liu Yong.

124
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,500
Interrogate Chen Yiming.

125
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,780
Okay.

126
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,420
Are you an idiot?

127
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,900
No gun.

128
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,260
Use your hand.

129
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,460
What?

130
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,940
Is your hand okay?

131
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,260
Go to the hospital.

132
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,020
Why did you send me a photo?

133
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,420
For real?

134
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,980
Are you sure?

135
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,500
Great.

136
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,140
You're my best friend.

137
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,660
I'll buy you late-night snacks.

138
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,940
What's that?

139
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,820
Are you crazy?

140
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,340
They found my gun!

141
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,540
My dad won't call me

142
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,820
an unfilial son in my dreams anymore.

143
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Are you serious?

144
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
They found it!

145
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,060
How did they find it?

146
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,980
I don't know. Anyway, they found it!

147
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,380
So sudden?

148
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,820
Yes, I didn't expect it.

149
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,080
Where are you going?

150
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,100
None of your business.

151
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,780
Tianyi.

152
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,540
Inform everyone.

153
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,860
It's a big deal.

154
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,940
We must celebrate it.

155
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,300
Yes. I'll tell them.

156
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,290
This.

157
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,780
Whose SIM card is it?

158
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,100
It's mine.

159
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,020
Who gave you?

160
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,660
Who told you to call?

161
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,660
Who's behind you?

162
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,900
Qi Hanchen or his man.

163
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,780
An Zhihui?

164
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,900
Chen Yiming, let me remind you.

165
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,540
The sooner you talk,

166
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,140
the safer you are,

167
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,420
understand?

168
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,980
I won't tell you anything

169
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,620
until my wife and kid

170
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,940
are safe.

171
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,820
What about the large transfers

172
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,180
to your mother's account?

173
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,860
It's

174
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,300
the same question.

175
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,060
Mr. Qi,

176
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,020
the friend who asked me
to pass on a message

177
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,830
wants to meet with you.

178
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,940
Are you available?

179
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,820
Sorry, Uncle Long.

180
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,980
I've been so busy.

181
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,980
Maybe a few days later.

182
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,060
I know you're always laughing,

183
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,660
but deep down, you're upset.

184
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,460
I'm so glad to see

185
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,300
your genuine smile.

186
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,540
This isn't over.

187
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,620
We only got the gun.

188
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,700
Here.

189
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,900
I know

190
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,540
you want to wear the uniform again,

191
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,660
and you really want to

192
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,620
prove yourself.

193
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,180
No matter what,

194
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,140
we'll always be your brothers,

195
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,560
right?

196
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,820
Come on. Cheers.

197
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,700
Cheers.

198
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,820
Cheers.

199
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,020
Cheers.

200
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,060
Bin.

201
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,100
It's been

202
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,420
a hard time,

203
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,660
but there are good things.

204
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,700
I just want to tell you

205
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,740
what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

206
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,100
What's yours

207
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,540
will always be yours.

208
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,020
Cheers. Congratulations.

209
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,500
Thanks, Uncle Man.

210
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,700
Come on.

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,580
Uncle Man's words

212
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,260
are always

213
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,500
nice

214
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,500
and wise.

215
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,660
Tianyi,

216
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,220
watch and learn,

217
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,940
Tianyi is good.

218
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,840
He's young and brave.

219
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
He fears nothing.

220
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,770
I wasn't as good as you.

221
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,870
Hello.

222
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,540
Are you sure?

223
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,780
It's not published,

224
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,140
but I'm sure it's true.

225
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,220
Qi Hanchen submitted another agreement

226
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,620
on behalf of Benniu Group to confirm

227
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,610
the legality of

228
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,820
the share transfer agreement.

229
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,220
Okay, I got it.

230
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,540
Thanks.

231
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,540
Tianyi.

232
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,260
I need to tell you something.

233
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,380
He's your brother.

234
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,180
You know him.

235
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,980
He's a decent

236
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,100
handsome man.

237
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,820
He's chased Na Fan

238
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,500
for a long time,

239
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,220
but why hasn't he

240
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,620
got her?

241
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,820
Can you give him a hand?

242
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,340
Yes, help me.

243
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,420
I'm your bro.

244
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,740
If I can be your sister's

245
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,220
boyfriend,

246
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,380
we'll be even closer,

247
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,580
right?

248
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,860
Didn't I help you?

249
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,820
Bao, you have no idea.

250
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,780
I've been so busy helping him

251
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,780
to chase my sister,

252
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,340
but he still can't get her.

253
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,940
How can I change my sister's mind?

254
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,820
That's true.

255
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,460
Binbin,

256
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,860
you've been in love

257
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,580
with her since you were young.

258
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,020
You've tried so hard.

259
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,700
Why haven't you

260
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,780
made any progress?

261
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,540
Tianyi.

262
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,980
Bin has proved himself.

263
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,820
Can you try again?

264
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,900
Yes.

265
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,340
Please help me.

266
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,020
Hello.

267
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,740
Zixuan, what's wrong?

268
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,780
I got it.

269
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,740
Don't come.

270
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,900
I'll be there in a minute.

271
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,700
What's wrong?

272
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,340
Qi Hanchen is playing dirty.

273
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,980
Something's wrong
with Tuan Island Market.

274
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,020
(Unit Chief's Office)

275
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,860
Xing.

276
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,340
Here's Liu Sixi's
bank transaction details.

277
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,700
I've checked it.

278
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,140
Recently, he's received

279
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,660
a large sum of money,

280
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,500
but

281
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,900
the source is weird.

282
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,100
Online gambling?

283
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,940
Yes, it's from
overseas gambling websites.

284
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,500
More importantly,

285
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,380
one of the remitters

286
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,820
named Yawei Sports

287
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,100
also appeared in Cai Jinhua's account.

288
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,180
Did Liu Sixi confess?

289
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,260
He did, but it was useless.

290
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,380
He doesn't even know

291
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,700
who asked him to kidnap Luo Jiahui.

292
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,460
What?

293
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,380
Here's the thing.

294
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,700
Someone found him on a forum

295
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
on an overseas

296
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,540
gambling website,

297
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,140
and gave him the deposit by giving him

298
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,100
convertible chips.

299
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,500
However, it's

300
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,660
an overseas server,

301
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,980
and it's anonymous

302
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,220
and untraceable.

303
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,540
How's Luo Jiahui doing?

304
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,020
In the hospital.

305
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
But the doctor said

306
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,140
she'd be fine.

307
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,980
Tell the detention center

308
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,620
to keep an eye on Chen Yiming.

309
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,340
If anything happens,

310
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
tell us immediately.

311
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,340
Okay, I'm on it.

312
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,500
If their share transfer agreement

313
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,820
is confirmed to be legal,

314
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,500
ours might be illegal.

315
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,180
Dian Lao'er

316
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,740
gave me

317
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,900
the share transfer agreement,

318
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
right?

319
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,980
It's handwritten, isn't it?

320
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,540
If Dian Lao'er

321
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,180
had been forced by Mr. An

322
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,940
to sign another deal

323
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,420
before he gave it to you,

324
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,100
we wouldn't be able to
prove its legality

325
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,740
because we can't prove

326
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,660
Dian Lao'er was forced
to sign another deal.

327
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,100
No. Both of you

328
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,580
are missing the point.

329
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,100
Our share transfer agreement

330
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,780
has a fatal flaw.

331
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,140
It's handwritten,

332
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,700
so it doesn't have specific rules.

333
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,580
It doesn't even clarify

334
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,140
whether it's a gift or a transfer.

335
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,500
Therefore, technically speaking,

336
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,900
it's not even

337
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,020
a formal contract.

338
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,140
However, their agreement

339
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,460
looks pretty formal.

340
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,700
I know you have a point,

341
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,660
but the problem is

342
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,060
how can we

343
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,900
solve this right now?

344
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
If we can't prove

345
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
their deal is illegal,

346
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,660
can we find a way to prove

347
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,020
the legality of our agreement?

348
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,020
I think you're right.

349
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,540
Even if

350
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,300
they're both legal,

351
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,780
we'll still have a chance.

352
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
That's right.

353
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,900
Bao.

354
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,820
Who gave you the share

355
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,060
transfer agreement?

356
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,300
Uncle Hai gave me

357
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
at Xingyu Pier.

358
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,340
Uncle Hai?

359
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,260
When you

360
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,820
opened the files,

361
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
did he see it?

362
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,900
Yes, he saw it clearly.

363
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,780
Bin, why are you here again?

364
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,980
I...

365
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,340
Hai.

366
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,620
I could say

367
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,380
I don't want the hypocrite

368
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,780
to get Dian Lao'er's

369
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,340
company shares,

370
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,940
but it's meaningless.

371
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,980
Actually, I'm here

372
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,300
for two things.

373
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,820
First,

374
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,460
I have to get

375
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,540
Dian Lao'er's shares.

376
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,580
They're very important.

377
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,540
If I can get them,

378
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,740
I'll be able to have

379
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,300
the operating rights
of Tuan Island Market.

380
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,540
Second,

381
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
most importantly,

382
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,020
five percent of Dian Lao'er's

383
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,100
shares

384
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,500
is the alimony for his father.

385
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,660
I have to get it.

386
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
Uncle Hai.

387
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,180
Back then,

388
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
you got injured

389
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,180
and couldn't work.

390
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,740
Dian Lao'er offered you this job, right?

391
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
You were brothers.

392
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,140
You owed him a favor.

393
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,260
You're right.

394
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,460
I'd rather owe money

395
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,900
than owe favors.

396
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,060
I understand.

397
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,180
I will return

398
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,300
his favor.

399
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,140
Uncle Hai.

400
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,060
Don't be scared.

401
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,940
You saw how Dian Lao'er died.

402
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,340
You saw the agreement

403
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,740
after Bao opened

404
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,580
the envelope.

405
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,180
You'll be our witness

406
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,500
and tell them

407
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,380
everything

408
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,860
you saw. That's it.

409
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,780
Bin.

410
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,260
Well...

411
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,540
My daughter is about to graduate.

412
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,220
She needs to find a job.

413
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,020
I don't want to affect her.

414
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,540
Will there be any bad consequences?

415
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,620
What consequences?

416
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,700
Hai.

417
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,740
Everyone knows

418
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,220
you love your daughter.

419
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,060
To be honest,

420
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,860
I also treat her like my daughter.

421
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,820
If anyone hurts her,

422
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,980
I'll definitely kill him.

423
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,700
Can you do it?

424
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,500
Hai, I need an answer.

425
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,460
Thanks.

426
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,900
Bye.

427
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,140
Thanks, Uncle Hai.

428
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,410
Thanks, Uncle Hai.

429
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,660
I don't know how to describe you.

430
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,260
Are you

431
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,820
a troublemaker

432
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,260
or a blessing?

433
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,220
For a blessing,

434
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,260
you almost got the steering group

435
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,100
to come here.

436
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,460
For a troublemaker,

437
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,540
you actually found the fun
that went missing

438
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,700
for two months.

439
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,420
What's your opinion?

440
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,300
What's on your mind?

441
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,700
We found the gun,

442
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,580
but the person ran away.

443
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,260
It's still not over.

444
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,820
So annoying.

445
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,980
Leaves can't survive

446
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,560
without roots.

447
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,700
Now that you've found the root,

448
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,900
finding out the truth

449
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,260
is just a matter of time,

450
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,780
right?

451
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,420
By the way,

452
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,340
your men need to spend some time

453
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,420
organizing the case details.

454
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,940
It's time to close the case.

455
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,220
Why are you so excited about

456
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,380
closing the case?

457
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,020
Of course.

458
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,500
Everyone wants

459
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,380
to close the case.

460
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,340
- But...
- Besides,

461
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
who am I doing this

462
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,980
for?

463
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,140
Fan.

464
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,740
Actually,

465
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,340
I can tell

466
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,740
Binbin is not a fickle man,

467
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,300
and you

468
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,060
have feelings for him.

469
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,180
You served the army,

470
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,620
and he's a policeman.

471
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,860
You'll

472
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,980
have a lot to talk about.

473
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,740
Don't worry.

474
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,940
I will think it through.

475
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,420
Sister, sister.

476
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,980
As Fan's brother,

477
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,740
Tianyi agreed to help me.

478
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
You're Fan's dear boss.

479
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,300
You have to help me.

480
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,340
What dear boss?

481
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,900
What Fan?

482
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,980
Does she know you?

483
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,020
Are you close to her?

484
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,340
- You don't deserve her.
- I...

485
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,740
Liang,

486
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,860
did you hear that?

487
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,820
I can't believe my sister

488
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,300
was so harsh to me.

489
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,220
How could she do that?

490
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,100
Why not.

491
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,780
Xuan,

492
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,900
what day is it today?

493
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,740
Why prepare this?

494
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,020
We need a celebration, don't we?

495
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,180
The gun was found,

496
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,220
which means Binbin

497
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,740
can go back to work soon.

498
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,820
Shouldn't we

499
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,420
celebrate it?

500
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,060
We should.

501
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Today,

502
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,260
I was talking to Tai

503
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,660
about you.

504
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,220
Liang, let me do it.

505
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,140
I knew

506
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,460
my brother-in-law

507
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,660
cared about me.

508
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,420
Sometimes, his love is so deep

509
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,020
that you can't see it with your eyes,

510
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,820
but you can feel it.

511
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,140
Thanks.

512
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,900
Liang, here.

513
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,340
Is it reliable?

514
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,580
It's not a secret.

515
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,540
They're holding a hearing tomorrow.

516
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,940
They've invited
not only industry leaders

517
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,380
but also government officials.

518
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,500
I'm talking about the witness.

519
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,020
Boss.

520
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,700
If they're holding a hearing,

521
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,420
they need some real stuff.

522
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,260
My friends in the relevant departments

523
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,540
have confirmed this.

524
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,300
Uncle Long.

525
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,300
Mr. Qi,

526
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,420
sorry to bother you.

527
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,020
Look,

528
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,820
my friend from last time

529
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,700
knows you're in trouble,

530
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,180
and he wants to give you a hand.

531
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,540
This friend is so powerful

532
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
and well-informed.

533
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,220
If his advice really works,

534
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,380
will you meet with him?

535
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,460
Okay.

536
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,580
Tell me about it.

537
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,900
Sister,

538
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,100
Fan told me

539
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,740
if I get my job back,

540
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,900
she'll be with me.

541
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,540
Do you think I should

542
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,340
buy a house near home

543
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
or near the school?

544
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,660
Why don't you think about

545
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,540
which hospital to give birth at?

546
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
It's on you.

547
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,820
You're a mother.

548
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,620
You know it better.

549
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,940
Shut up.

550
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,140
By the way,

551
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,460
how's the Tuan Island project?

552
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,500
I didn't have time

553
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,700
to ask you.

554
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,260
However, a few days ago,

555
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,780
I talked to Qi Hanchen

556
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,540
and An Zhihui.

557
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,420
They're not simple.

558
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,140
Did they

559
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,460
give you a hard time?

560
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,620
It's either win or die.

561
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,100
What's going on?

562
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,060
You have to take care of it.

563
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,740
Boss,

564
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,500
he's not simple.

565
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,820
He knows us and Tuan Island

566
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,060
very well,

567
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,620
but we know

568
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,060
nothing about him.

569
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,260
Based on the advice he gave us,

570
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,140
I don't think he has bad intentions.

571
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,380
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

572
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,180
Besides,

573
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,220
sometimes, only a thug

574
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,220
can deal with a thug.

575
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,060
Man was right.

576
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,980
You know business,

577
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,420
not crime.

578
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,540
It's not that simple.

579
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,780
Which means

580
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,500
we can only prove ourselves
at the hearing.

581
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,060
We can only use

582
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,900
business and legal means.

583
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,780
A clean hand wants no washing.

584
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Our witness and evidence

585
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,340
can prove its legality,

586
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,260
right?

587
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,140
(Hearing on the Share Transfer Agreement
Between Wen Group and Benniu Group)

588
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,500
- Did you find him?
- No.

589
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,300
We called Xingyu Pier.

590
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,140
The last time they saw him was

591
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,340
at 10:30 last night.

592
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,220
I also called his family,

593
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,380
but he wasn't home.

594
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,420
Can you find him

595
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,660
or not?

596
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,780
If you can find him,

597
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,820
I'll look for him myself.

598
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,220
Bao.

599
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,940
You're the host today.

600
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,820
You must finish the show

601
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,220
even if you're alone.

602
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,340
Yes.

603
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,020
I have to do this.

604
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,460
You two, keep looking.

605
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,300
Hurry up. Go.

606
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,180
You have to

607
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,980
find him as soon as possible.

608
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,780
We can't let

609
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,060
anything happen to him.

610
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,740
Otherwise, I can't face
his family anymore.

611
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,940
Don't worry.

612
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,020
Bye, Bao.

613
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,500
Bye.

614
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,940
Where is he?

615
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,620
The most important thing now

616
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
is to decide

617
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,380
whether to continue or not.

618
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,220
The process can continue,

619
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,260
but the meeting has to stop.

620
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,540
We don't have

621
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,900
a witness to prove its legality.

622
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,500
Look,

623
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,700
tell them the truth.

624
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,620
We'll hold it next time

625
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
when we find him.

626
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,140
Let's sit down.

627
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Does Hai have a fishing boat?

628
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,700
Xingyu Pier!

629
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,820
I got it.

630
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,260
I'm so sorry.

631
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,900
- We're having
- How is it?

632
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,740
an emergency.

633
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,980
They found Hai.

634
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,520
- Found him?
- A key witness...

635
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,940
It's so weird.

636
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,460
He took the boat out

637
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,860
around 11 p.m. Last night.

638
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Binbin and Tianyi

639
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,100
just took it back.

640
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,740
You know them.

641
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,580
I'm worried.

642
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,540
I'll check on them.

643
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,900
Hurry up.

644
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,180
Ms. Wen has almost finished it.

645
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,740
I'm here. Don't worry.

646
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,420
We will provide

647
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,620
all the notarial documents

648
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,740
we have

649
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,180
to all notaries

650
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,620
and everyone in this room.

651
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,780
You can read them first.

652
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,260
As for the next hearing...

653
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Call me if you need anything.

654
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,620
We'll tell you in advance, okay?

655
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,460
Thanks.

656
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,300
Tianyi.

657
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,500
Binbin.

658
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,740
This boat?

659
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Yes.

660
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,980
Hai!

661
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,100
What are you doing?

662
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,540
Get up! What are you doing?

663
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,060
Bao,

664
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,220
I'm so sorry.

665
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,420
I can't risk

666
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,540
my family's life and future

667
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
for this.

668
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
What a surprise.

669
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,780
Glad to see you.

670
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,220
Bao, Bao.

671
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,860
Calm down.

672
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,500
They're recording this.

673
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,700
Last time, I told you

674
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,260
I'd see you in the business world.

675
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,140
I think you got me wrong.

676
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,220
I was talking to Ms. Wen

677
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,980
instead of you.

678
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,260
What are you talking about?

679
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,860
Bao.

680
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,180
You got this nickname

681
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,620
over a decade ago from your gang, right?

682
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,860
Ten years ago,

683
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,860
you sold goods in Tuan Island.

684
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,620
And now,

685
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,180
this is a game of capital.

686
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,060
Ten years ago,

687
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
you made a name with your fists.

688
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,460
And now, you're doing business

689
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,100
as an ignorant loser

690
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,540
who didn't even finish

691
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,460
high school.

692
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
You'll lose everything.

693
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,420
- Go to hell!
- They're trying to provoke you!

694
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,220
Calm down!

695
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,020
See?

696
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,140
The policeman knows the law.

697
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,100
Bao,

698
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,820
you're exactly like Dian Lao'er

699
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,980
when he went crazy,

700
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,100
aren't you?

701
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,740
Hai,

702
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,380
you know what happened to Dian Lao'er.

703
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,380
The same things always happen,

704
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,700
especially to the same kind of people.

705
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,940
Hai.

706
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,580
I think you should be grateful.

707
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,900
Binbin.

708
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,380
I'm fine.

709
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,860
Get off me.

710
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,340
Get off me.

711
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,620
You said

712
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,180
Dian Lao'er and I

713
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,900
are the same

714
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,500
kind of people.

715
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,260
What kind?

716
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,330
Of course

717
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,420
respected gangster leaders.

718
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,140
No.

719
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,380
I think we're

720
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,820
very different.

721
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,380
Is that so?

722
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,140
Why don't you

723
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,740
tell me?

724
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,150
I...

725
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,280
What are you doing?

726
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,340
I hit you.

727
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,580
Yes, I did.

728
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,820
Recording, right?

729
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,660
Hey, bro,

730
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,620
hold it up.

731
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,060
Don't shake it.

732
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,220
Since it's a video,

733
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,980
I want to look good.

734
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,220
My hair is a little messy

735
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,220
because of the wind.

736
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,020
I, Bao Chenyan,

737
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,380
just hit An Zhihui.

738
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,820
An.

739
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,540
You want to know

740
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,620
why we're different.

741
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,460
Listen carefully,

742
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,820
it's because

743
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,300
if I had been here last time,

744
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,420
you wouldn't been dead.

745
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,980
I've seen many people like you.

746
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
You dress like

747
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,900
you're somebody,

748
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,100
but you're just a dog.

749
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,940
Understand?

750
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,980
You bully others

751
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,820
to please your master,

752
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,860
right?

753
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,420
You want to teach me?

754
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,260
Do you deserve it?

755
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,860
I

756
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,980
hit you.

757
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,820
So what?

758
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,700
Want to play?

759
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,860
Let's play!

760
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,220
Hai.

761
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,620
Uncle Hai!

762
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,460
You're doing this for your family.

763
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,660
I just want to tell you one thing!

764
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,940
If I were you,

765
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,140
I'd do the same thing!

766
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,380
No problem.

767
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,100
Bye!

768
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,540
(Binjiang Detention Center;
Relevant Personnel Only)

769
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,740
No.

770
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,100
I want to see Xing Liang.

771
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,420
I have to talk to him.

772
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,500
Xing Liang.

773
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,640
I want to see Xing Liang!

774
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,380
Officer!

775
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,010
Officer!

776
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,860
Officer!

777
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,060
I need to report something!

778
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,220
I want to see Xing Liang!

779
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,460
Did you hit him?

780
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,520
Yes.

781
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,220
I also let them record it.

782
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,580
It was windy out there,

783
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,300
so my hair got messy.

784
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,380
You have no idea how disgusting he was.

785
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,860
Honestly,

786
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
I wanted to hit him too.

787
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,460
It was a trap! Didn't you know?

788
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,580
You handled the evidence

789
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,370
to them for free.

790
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,260
It's not something you'd do.

791
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:17,950
Come in.

792
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,660
Someone wants to see Mr. Bao.

793
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,300
Who's Bao Chenyan?

794
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,900
Here, officer.

795
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,180
We're from Haihu police station.

796
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,580
We received a report that

797
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,420
you assaulted someone

798
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,300
and caused minor injuries.

799
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,300
Please come with us.

800
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,720
Wait, are you sure about that?

801
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,020
They started it,

802
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,860
so it was self-defense.

803
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,900
Why are you arresting us?

804
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,740
We're asking you now.

805
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,700
The reporter has

806
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,620
a clear video.

807
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,980
If you have a problem,

808
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,820
you'll have time

809
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,060
to tell us at the station.

810
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,780
- You...
- Tianyi.

811
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,540
It's alright.

812
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,740
Look at you.

813
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,580
You all look so worried

814
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,460
I'm really fine.

815
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,820
I don't know business

816
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,660
or contract law.

817
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,620
You can handle it without me, right?

818
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,820
Bao.

819
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,020
Do you know

820
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,380
your mission?

821
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,140
Don't worry.

822
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,860
I'm perfectly fine.

823
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,060
I'm fine.

824
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,420
I'm fine.

825
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,060
- Don't worry.
- Go.

826
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,600
Did you see it?

827
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,100
They already got the injury report.

828
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,820
It was planned.

829
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
They had planned it

830
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,100
before they got on the boat.

831
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,020
They want to stop

832
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,860
the hearing.

833
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,260
At this point...

834
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,060
Sister,

835
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,620
we have to stall for time.

836
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,790
(Repentance Leads to a Bright Future)

837
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,060
Xuan, don't worry.

838
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,900
Can you listen to me?

839
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,420
You must stay calm.

840
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,460
You can't be freaked out

841
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,180
and lose control.

842
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,740
I'm so busy right now.

843
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,940
Talk to you at home.

844
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,460
Goodbye.

845
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,980
How are Hui and my kid?

846
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,380
Tell me.

847
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,460
How's my family?

848
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,100
I've told you

849
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,540
the kid is healthy

850
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,740
and Luo Jiahui is doing well.

851
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,060
What else do you want?

852
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,540
I can tell you

853
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,620
everything,

854
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,300
but you must ensure their safety.

855
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Please!

856
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,500
Please calm down.

857
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,260
What's wrong?

858
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,260
What do you want to say?

859
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,700
Is Bao coming?

860
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,420
Chen Yiming.

861
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,780
What's that got to do

862
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,820
with you?

863
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,740
Of course.

864
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,460
He's the mastermind

865
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,620
