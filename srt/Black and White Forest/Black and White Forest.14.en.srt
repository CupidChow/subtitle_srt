1
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,620
(14 Years Ago)

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,800
Isn't this Jiang?

3
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,280
It's been a long time.

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
How have you been?

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,520
Just dawdling.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,280
How can you say that?

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,520
really dawdling,

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,280
but you're not.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
You're

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,560
famous in this area.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,280
You have a convoy

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,920
and a company.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,760
You're powerful.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,760
What's the point?

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,320
Listen, don't mess with me.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,040
I'm in a bad mood.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,960
Are you

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,400
thinking about Tuan Island Market?

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
Just a heads-up.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
In Binjiang,

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
you can

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,400
get anything

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,000
except for Tuan Island.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
Do you know

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
the boss?

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
Who?

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,680
Wen Liangsong.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,240
Mr. Wen.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,920
He's from

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,760
Yang City

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,400
and has a wide range of business.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,760
He knows

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,600
so many people,

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,360
including the police.

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,800
You're no match.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,320
Even if we

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,160
work together,

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
he can eliminate us easily.

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,880
You should give up.

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,700
(Tuan Island Market)

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
Is it that hard?

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,880
I like

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,960
challenges.

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Lao'er,

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
he's so arrogant.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
Why did you talk nicely?

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
You know nothing.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,440
The nicer I am,

51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
the angrier he is.

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,760
When they fight with each other,

53
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,720
we'll benefit from it.

54
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,400
I've been number two for so long.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,560
It's time to be number one.

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,820
=Black&White Forest=

57
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,820
=Episode 14=

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
If it hadn't been for the dog,

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,960
I wouldn't have found you.

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Well, bros,

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,600
can we talk nicely?

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,080
Talk nicely?

63
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,960
I've lost weight by looking for you.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,520
Well,

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,040
any last words?

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Tell me.

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,840
Look,

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,200
I know we both want money.

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
If you kill me,

70
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
you'll lose the money.

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,240
Then give us money for your life,

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
okay?

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,520
But I don't have money.

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,720
No money?

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,320
No money? No money?

76
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
- Stop!
- No money?

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,480
When I get Tuan Island,
I'll have money,

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,800
and I'll pay back the money!

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,320
All of it!

80
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,160
Is that right?

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,040
Yes!

82
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
Do you take us for fools?

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,680
You want to stall for time

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,960
and find a place to hide,

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,160
- right?
- No!

86
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,260
- Stall for time?
- No!

87
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,840
- Stop!
- It's not like that!

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,800
We're hiding from
the police and the enemy.

89
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Is that right?

90
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,920
Yes!

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
Why would I hide from you?

92
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
It'll only make me

93
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,960
suffer, right?

94
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,800
Yes!

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Bro.

96
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,680
A word, please.

97
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,720
Do you really believe him?

98
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
He's got a point.

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,120
If we kill him,

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
we won't get the money.

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,800
We'll become a joke.

102
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,040
What? Look at him.

103
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,840
He's so cunning.

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,400
He's up to no good.

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
Why don't we

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
take his head back.

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360
That's also acceptable,

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
right?

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,240
I'm giving you one last chance.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
If you fool me,

111
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,280
I'll kill both of you.

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,160
- Thanks!
- No problem!

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,640
No one can stay alive

114
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,880
if he doesn't pay back
the Sun Family's money.

115
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,000
- Understand?
- Yes!

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,760
We met him in Dian Lao'er's house
the other day.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,080
Look what he's holding.

118
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,080
Takeouts?

119
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,120
What's wrong?

120
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
It's for many people.

121
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,840
Let's follow him.

122
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't move.

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
Good dog.

124
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
Don't move.

125
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Here you are.

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,920
Good dog.

127
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,400
Eat it.

128
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,040
It's really Dian Lao'er.

129
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
I'll call them over.

130
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,580
(Surveillance)

131
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,620
(Huangtangzhuang,
Daqiao Village, Hengshan Town)

132
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,760
Keep watching.

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,080
Go.

134
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
Stupid dog.

135
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,720
Come here.

136
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,960
Go!

137
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
Go!

138
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,680
Boss.

139
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,620
(Daqiao Village, 15 km, 23 mins)

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,840
Okay.

141
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
I was wondering who it was.

142
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,920
My old friends.

143
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,240
You came to me.

144
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
Don't blame me for this.

145
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,160
Dian Lao'er, stop talking nonsense.

146
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,640
No one is scared of you.

147
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
Say it again!

148
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,080
Get them!

149
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,320
Are you commanding us?

150
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,960
Do you want to die?

151
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Yes.

152
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
You owe us money, don't you?

153
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,160
Please do me a favor.

154
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,040
Want money?

155
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,320
I have a lot of money.

156
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,900
Give Dian Lao'er to me,

157
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,360
and I'll pay you

158
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,160
1 million yuan.

159
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,510
Do you have 1 million yuan?

160
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
Are you serious?

161
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,600
He's a rich kid.

162
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
1 million yuan is not a big deal.

163
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
Did I ask you to talk?

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,360
Look at him.

165
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
When will he get

166
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
1 million yuan?

167
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,160
I'll give you the money tonight,

168
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,560
and you can go home tomorrow.

169
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,360
Think about it. Don't miss the chance!

170
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
Think about it.

171
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,760
This cunning man

172
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,280
is turning us

173
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
against each other!

174
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,360
Don't listen to him.

175
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,960
If you don't believe me,

176
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,480
I'll write an IOU.

177
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,440
He's lying! He's a liar!

178
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,420
Wait.

179
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,960
It's a good idea.

180
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,080
I've stayed here for too long.

181
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,670
It's also

182
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,860
acceptable.

183
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,260
Wait.

184
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,560
I've heard

185
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,210
the Sun Family from Da An Alliance

186
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,240
is

187
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,960
always honest.

188
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,950
Yes.

189
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,160
How can you do this?

190
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
You've been lying to me.

191
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,780
Who the hell are you?

192
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,900
Calm down!

193
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,180
What?

194
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,100
Don't hit me!

195
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,600
- I'm sorry!
- Who's a liar?

196
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,540
- No.
- I'm sorry!

197
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,220
Who's a liar? Huh?

198
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,700
Not you. I'm a liar! I'm nasty!

199
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,140
I can kill you right now.

200
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,980
Get off me!

201
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,540
Bro, we're friends.

202
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,500
- Okay, I'll stop.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

203
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,340
We're friends.

204
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,420
Who's your friend?

205
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,700
- What?
- Infighting?

206
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,020
Stop yelling!

207
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,900
They ran away.

208
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,820
They ran away!

209
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,660
We can't stay here.

210
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,900
- Where are they?
- Over there!

211
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,220
Where?

212
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,140
How should I know? They ran away!

213
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,620
They must be around.

214
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,700
Keep searching!

215
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,740
Yes, sir!

216
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,900
Hurry!

217
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,140
Useless.

218
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,020
Locate Sun Changhe's phone.

219
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,220
- Okay.
- Okay, got it.

220
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,700
Bro.

221
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,260
I think

222
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,540
we shouldn't have

223
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,860
lost control.

224
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,700
We should take that guy's

225
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,800
1 million yuan

226
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,620
and go home.

227
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,380
He's a useless dog.

228
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,360
No matter how hard we try,

229
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,820
we can't get a penny from him.

230
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,480
But he got a point.

231
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,410
The Sun Family is always honest.

232
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,140
If we break the rule,

233
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,020
it'll be serious.

234
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,700
Even if we can get the money,

235
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,700
we won't be able to go back.

236
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,660
Lao'er.

237
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,940
Hello, I...

238
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,460
I'm here.

239
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,660
Where are you?

240
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,530
I...

241
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,060
I'm at the location you sent me.

242
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,500
Okay.

243
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,460
Okay.

244
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,530
I'm coming.

245
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,380
Where the hell are you?

246
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,380
Lao'er, I can see you.

247
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,020
I see... I'm in an RV.

248
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,980
Here, here.

249
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,340
- Can you see me?
- RV?

250
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,340
I'm coming.

251
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,900
Come on. Get over here.

252
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,140
Lao'er.

253
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,140
Where are we going?

254
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,220
Go around the ring road, don't get on

255
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,460
the national highway.

256
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,620
Okay, got it.

257
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,620
Hello.

258
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,820
Mr. Qi.

259
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,100
Uncle Long is here.

260
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,980
See you at Shihuiyao

261
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,180
in an hour.

262
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,260
Bro,

263
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,260
I...

264
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,100
I have a question.

265
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,460
He set the time and place.

266
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,140
What if...?

267
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,980
You have no choice.

268
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,540
If you want to see him,
you have to do this.

269
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
Okay.

270
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,100
I'll be there

271
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,180
on time.

272
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,020
Okay.

273
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
You'll sign

274
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,740
the transfer agreement there.

275
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,020
The bids are about to open.

276
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,180
I have many things to do.

277
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,580
I can't wait.

278
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,780
Uncle Long.

279
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,340
I'll leave it to you.

280
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,690
Dian Lao'er is very emotional right now.

281
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,140
Don't provoke him.

282
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,940
Just agree to whatever he says.

283
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,500
We'll talk about it later.

284
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,420
Mr. Qi, don't be too polite.

285
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,940
It's up to you.

286
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,580
Thanks.

287
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,780
Good luck, Uncle Long.

288
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,460
Goodbye.

289
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,300
After Uncle Long talks to him

290
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,700
and leaves,

291
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,380
we'll talk to him about the contract.

292
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,220
No matter what he wants,

293
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,420
just say yes.

294
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,540
Remember,

295
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,020
no matter what happens,

296
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,180
we have to get the deal today.

297
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,700
We don't have time.

298
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,820
What if we can't persuade him?

299
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,020
I only want his

300
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,820
signature and fingerprint.

301
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,630
As for the rest,

302
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,460
it's up to you.

303
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,540
We've located Sun Changhe's phone.

304
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,540
He's moving.

305
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,780
- Send it to Liu Yong.
- Okay.

306
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,660
Keep driving after we get off.

307
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,860
Okay, Lao'er.

308
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,740
Where's the phone?

309
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,460
What's wrong?

310
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,820
The police are hunting us.

311
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,940
I think

312
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,180
they're locating your phone.

313
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,780
I've thrown mine away.

314
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,300
You should leave it here.

315
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,580
I'm

316
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,620
Dian Lao'er.

317
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,900
I'm An Zhihui.

318
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,740
We talked before.

319
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,540
Director An.

320
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,380
Nice to meet you.

321
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,380
How many kilometers?

322
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,220
6 kilometers.

323
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,060
(Daqiao Village)

324
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,900
Ten minutes.

325
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,340
Turn right at that corner.

326
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,940
Okay.

327
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,700
Hello.

328
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
He's An, the director of our

329
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,460
outreach department.

330
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
He'll deal with this

331
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
on behalf of me.

332
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,420
Just talk to him.

333
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,740
Okay.

334
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,780
Okay.

335
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,820
Where's Uncle Long?

336
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,100
Want to talk to me?

337
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,060
Uncle Long.

338
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,980
We've finally met.

339
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,060
We shouldn't have.

340
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,490
Five minutes.

341
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,000
Tell me what you want.

342
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,740
Who

343
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,660
hired the killer?

344
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,060
Of course, I know

345
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,620
it's inappropriate.

346
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,580
However, everyone thinks

347
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,420
I hired him to kill Bao.

348
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,300
They're hunting me.

349
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,260
I have no choice but to talk to you.

350
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,580
In our circle,

351
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,540
we mustn't disclose
our client's information.

352
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,660
However, I do respect

353
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,780
Mr. Qi.

354
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,180
What do you mean?

355
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,500
How about this?

356
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,060
I'll deal with it.

357
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,580
I'll prove

358
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,940
your innocence in a week.

359
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,820
As for the person,

360
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,700
you don't need to know,

361
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,300
and I won't break the rules.

362
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,840
- Can you accept it?
- Okay.

363
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
Okay.

364
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,140
Thank you so much.

365
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,820
You should thank Mr. Qi.

366
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,700
If it wasn't for him,

367
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,660
I wouldn't get involved.

368
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,220
Let's go.

369
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,740
(Share Transfer Agreement.)

370
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,540
What's this?

371
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,700
Share transfer agreement.

372
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,340
Mr. Qi said you knew about this.

373
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
Sign it,

374
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,180
and I'll take it back.

375
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,020
I know

376
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,500
this.

377
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,260
What? There are many papers.

378
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,220
I need to read it

379
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,180
first.

380
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,940
Take your time.

381
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,340
We're not in a hurry.

382
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,100
Are you saying

383
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,140
you won't leave

384
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,060
until I sign it?

385
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,080
Police! Get out!

386
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,060
Bro, come here.

387
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,380
Oh, no.

388
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,940
An,

389
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,460
I think the police

390
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,900
know where we are.

391
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's go somewhere else.

392
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,100
Mr. Qi has said

393
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,700
we're not doing anything illegal.

394
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,620
However, you can't leave

395
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,940
unless you sign the deal.

396
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,390
Why do you sound

397
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,300
so rude?

398
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,060
Why?

399
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,780
Why should I do it?

400
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,980
Do I have to read it at this hour?

401
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,380
It's so dark!

402
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,300
I've never read so many words

403
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,780
in my entire life!

404
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,180
Psycho.

405
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,820
You're afraid of the police!

406
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,100
I'm innocent!

407
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,740
This project

408
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,540
is more important than my life!

409
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,340
Stop looking!

410
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,980
I won't sign it!

411
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,060
What can you do?

412
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,540
Psycho!

413
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,980
You're all crazy!

414
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,540
(Party B)

415
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,420
What the hell?

416
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,950
What contract

417
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,320
requires such a method?

418
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,260
No idea.

419
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,220
That man looks polite,

420
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,860
but he hits hard.

421
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,700
Exactly.

422
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,340
But he deserves it.

423
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Sign it.

424
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,860
I...

425
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,540
won't!

426
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,420
Sign it!

427
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,290
No!

428
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,020
What are you doing?

429
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,260
Don't go too far.

430
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
If he dies, will you pay for him?

431
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,740
If my shares are gone,

432
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,860
you'll lose the 1 million yuan too!

433
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,340
Sun?

434
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,700
Well,

435
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,140
what's the matter?

436
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,300
My boss will give you the money.

437
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,100
You can leave.

438
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,740
Your boss?

439
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,700
Do we know him?

440
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,860
Do you take us for fools?

441
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,300
Where's the money?

442
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,260
Exactly.

443
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,780
Hey.

444
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,380
Did I tell you to leave?

445
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,860
Is he fooling us?

446
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,580
If you don't go,

447
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,100
you'll lose the chance.

448
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,900
I...

449
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,610
Where's Dian Lao'er?

450
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,340
Officer.

451
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
Get down!

452
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,420
Turn left.

453
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,100
You have to kill me,

454
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,700
or I'll kill all your family!

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

458
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,700
Who are you looking for?

459
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,740
Do you have a reservation?

460
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,660
Police. We need to talk to An Zhihui.

461
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,060
Wait a minute.

462
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,740
Hello, Secretary Chen.

463
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,100
Two police officers
want to talk to Mr. An.

464
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,060
Okay.

465
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,300
Officers,

466
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,400
this way.

467
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,980
Please come in.

468
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,740
(MorningStar Capital)

469
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,900
Have a seat.

470
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,180
Where's An Zhihui?

471
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,340
Please wait a moment.

472
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,620
When can we see him?

473
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,580
Please wait a moment.

474
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,700
I'm coming.

475
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,420
I need to bring Changhe and Datou back

476
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,720
and let them

477
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,350
rest in peace.

478
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,640
On the other hand,

479
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,140
I have to take revenge.

480
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,860
They can't die for nothing.

481
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,420
Please calm down.

482
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,260
I'll ask them to send

483
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,060
their bodies back.

484
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,420
The police have found out about this.

485
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,340
If you come, you'll become their target,

486
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,500
and it'll be dangerous.

487
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,980
Don't worry.

488
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,940
I'll find out

489
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,340
who did this

490
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,820
and give you an explanation in ten days.

491
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,340
Okay.

492
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,100
We've waited for so long.

493
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,540
When can we talk to him?

494
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,780
Please wait a minute.

495
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,060
Tell me when.

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,300
You're a broken record?

498
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,420
What's your name?

499

504
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,300
I'm so sorry.

505
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,340
Why are you standing here?

506
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,180
Move!

507
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,180
I'm so sorry.

508
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,820
What's wrong with you?

509
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
And you.

510
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,900
Why didn't you serve tea?

511
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,740
No need.

512
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,420
When can we see An Zhihui?

513
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,420
He's having a meeting.

514
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,060
It's almost over.

515

Please wait a moment.

516
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,460
I need to see him now.

517
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,580
Okay.

518
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,580
Follow me.

519
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,620
I'll keep you in mind,

520
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,420

We have a lot of work to do.

523
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,420
Director An is very busy.

524
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,540
It's an important meeting.

525
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,140
Officers, I'm sorry.

526
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,780
Please wait a moment.

Let's

528
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,260
move forward as we discussed.

529
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,500
I want to see real progress,

530
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,100
okay?

531
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,180
Enough for today.

532
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,660
Go.

533
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,660
Come on.

534
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,740
Mr. Qi,

535
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,660
Director An was taken away.

536
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
I've told him what to do.

537
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,780
Get back to work.

538
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,980
Get things done.

539
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,420
Don't affect our bidding.

540
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,420
Sorry, I'm late.

541
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,740
Come on.

542
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,060
Here's to you.

543
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,260
Cheers.

544
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,780
Hello.

545
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,940
We're Binjiang Crime Investigation Unit.

546
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,060
We need your cooperation.

547
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,540
We have some questions.

548
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,940
Where were you

549
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,100
and what were you doing

550
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,340
last night from

551
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,460
9 p.m. to 11 p.m.?

552
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,420
I was at home.

553
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,620
There's surveillance.

554
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,770
Mr. Xing.

555
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,740
Do you have other evidence?

556
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,100
What else do you need?

557
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,760
By the way,

558
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,180
I was having an online meeting

559
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,460
with a client.

560
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,260
If you need,

561
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,940
I'll send you his contact.

562
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,140
However,

563
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,740
he's a Frech,

564
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,820
and he's not as polite as me.

565
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,620
If you want to talk to him,

566
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,260
I'm afraid you need to go to France.

567
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,380
An Zhihui,

568
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,980
you had the meeting

569
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,100
at the right time.

570
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,580
Of course,

571
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,900
you got lucky.

572
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,220
You're luckier.

573
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,780
If it wasn't for my information,

574
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,900
you would

575
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,220
investigate it

576
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,220
in the wrong direction,

577
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,580
and it'd be a waste of time.

578
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,620
You're right about that.

579
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,610
If the investigation goes wrong,

580
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,100
we'll be in trouble.

581
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,620
However,

582
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,340
we're also lucky.

583
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,420
By the way, I'll show you something.

584
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,180
Is it clear?

585
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
Then

586
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,740
I hope you can tell us

587
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,980
why you showed up
in the highway around Nanshan

588
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,260
while you were having a meeting.

589
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,020
You should know

590
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,980
you're not the only one who can talk.

591
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,620
If you tell us the truth,

592
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,380
we'll have mercy on you.

593
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,100
If it's too late,

594
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,220
do you know we'll

595
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,780
give you another chance?

596
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,140
Hello.

597
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,340
What?

598
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,020
Prepare for interrogation.

599
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,900
Liu Yong.

600
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,060
An Zhihui,

601
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,140
you can take time to think about

602
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,900
how to explain this picture.

603
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,080
Of course,

604
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,700
we can wait for you.

605
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,350
However, I need to tell you this.

606
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,140
The same words

607
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,900
have different effects

608
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,860
at different times.

609
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,620
Officer,

610
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,660
I don't understand

611
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,940
what you're talking about.

612
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,780
An Zhihui,

613
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,340
stop playing dumb.

614
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,320
Wait. I was wrong.

615
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,060
I had a meeting
the day before yesterday.

616
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,860
Last night,

617
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,540
I went to a farm near Nanshan

618
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,380
to pick vegetables.

619
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,620
Who would pick vegetables at night?

620
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,780
No one says

621
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,380
I can't pick vegetables at night, right?

622
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,580
Where were you last night at 9 p.m.?

623
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,180
By the river.

624
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,620
Why did you kill them?

625
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,220
They looked like rich people,

626
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,100
and I wanted money.

627
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,260
It was an accident.

628
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,140
Do you know An Zhihui?

629
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,380
An Zhihui?

630
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,430
No.

631
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,060
Mr. Xing, he's lying.

632
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,180
Mr. Xing,

633
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,060
An Zhihui

634
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,300
is a gangster.

635
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,780
He's a liar.

636
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,060
By the way,

637
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,180
how's it going?

638
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,780
He insisted that

639
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,660
he only wanted the money
and killed them

640
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,180
by accident.

641
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,940
He said he didn't know An Zhihui.

642
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,460
What the hell?

643
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,260
He turned himself in

644
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,940
right after we arrested An Zhihui

645
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,500
and took

646
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,580
all the blame.

647
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,260
He's certainly a scapegoat.

648
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,820
Mr. Xing.

649
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,180
We can't release him.

650
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,100
Boss,

651
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,540
he turned himself in
with the weapon and bloody clothes.

652
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,380
The evidence is solid.

653
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,660
Unless he changes his words,

654
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,460
or we find other evidence,

655
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,980
it'll be hard to convict

656
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,180
An Zhihui of murder.

657
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,500
Mr. Xing, we'll

658
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,100
search An Zhihui's company and house

659
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,340
to look for other evidence.

660
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,660
Hello.

661
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,820
Mr. Tai.

662
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,380
Release him?

663
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,140
Release him.

664
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,140
Someone pleaded guilty,

665
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,140
and you don't have evidence.

666
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,540
Time is up.

667
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,020
You have to release him.

668
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,060
What do you mean?

669
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,500
Bin will definitely get a major demerit.

670
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,300
Listen, if you can't solve
the murder case,

671
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,900
he'll be investigated
for criminal responsibility

672
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,840
I'll talk to

673
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,500
the procuratorate.

674
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,500
At this point,

675
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
you should focus on

676
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,900
the case and the gun.

677
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,940
At such a sensitive time,

678
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,220
please don't make it worse.

679
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,460
Xing, can you put yourself in my shoes?

680
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,380
Hurry up.

681
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,500
Listen, I can't sleep at night.

682
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,780
I'm afraid of missing a call.

683
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,660
- Where are you going?
- Release him!

684
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,860
(Binjiang PSB Criminal Technology Unit)

685
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,300
Listen,

686
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,620
don't go too far.

687
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,300
Otherwise,

688
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,340
I'll report you!

689
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,220
In real name!

690
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,140
An made a mistake

691
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,980
last night.

692
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,540
I apologize on behalf of him.

693
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,300
As for the compensation,

694
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,350
I'll give you a 2-percent share

695
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,020
of Tuan Island project

696
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,500
apart from your previous shares.

697
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,500
In addition,

698
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,980
I can transfer the 1 million yuan

699
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,300
to you anytime.

700
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,860
What?

701
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,940
Boss,

702
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,980
I'm... I'm sorry.

703
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,340
I was so rude.

704
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,060
They died last night.

705
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,940
It's serious.

706
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,460
You shouldn't show up

707
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,960
until this is over.

708
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,100
I can send you abroad.

709
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,060
You'll come back when this is over.

710
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,740
Okay.

711
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,100
No problem.

712
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,610
Thanks.

713
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,260
Well,

714
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,580
boss,

715
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,260
when can I leave?

716
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,420
Anytime.

717
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,980
Where are you?

718
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,660
I'm at sea.

719
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,940
How about this?

720
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,140
Give me a time

721
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
and location.

722
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,980
I'll go there, okay?

723
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,780
Wait for my call.

724
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,940
Boss,

725
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,260
it's all my fault.

726
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,580
I was reckless and made a mistake.

727
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,740
Sorry for the trouble.

728
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,700
It's not all your fault.

729
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,980
They deserved to die.

730
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,140
We just need to

731
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,140
clean it up.

732
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,220
Don't leave any traces.

733
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,420
But we have a problem.

734
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,940
From what I know about Dian Lao'er,

735
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,140
I think he'll sell you out.

736
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,580
Boss,

737
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,980
you mean...?

738
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,060
The best solution

739
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,620
is to make him disappear.

740
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,140
Okay.

741
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,380
(Upper First-class Hospital,
Outpatient and Emergency)

742
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,740
Dian Lao'er...

743
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,100
It was a big failure.

744
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,180
I don't think

745
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,820
he'll give up.

746
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,460
Bao,

747
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,380
we can't be affected by him.

748
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,900
At this point,

749
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,020
we can't mess with him.

750
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,940
If the bidding goes wrong,

751
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,860
it'll be a great loss for us.

752
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,020
Dian Lao'er

753
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,140
had it coming.

754
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,460
What's that got to do with us?

755
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,020
Why would it affect our project?

756
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,140
You don't know.

757
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,340
Even a worm will turn

758
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,580
if he finds another buyer

759
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,020
to stir up trouble,

760
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,460
we'll all suffer.

761
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,860
Phone.

762
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,820
Hello, who is this?

763
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,860
Speak.

764
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,980
Bao,

765
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,620
I'm Dian Lao'er.

766
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,380
Lao'er?

767
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,020
How can you have time

768
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,300
for me?

769
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,620
I want

770
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,060
to talk to you

771
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,220
about Tuan Island.

772
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,060
Why are you so formal?

773
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,180
I'm so surprised.

774
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,460
You want to talk about Tuan Island?

775
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,300
Why?

776
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,180
It's none of your business.

777
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,860
Talk to me?

778
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,500
Listen,

779
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,660
I know what happened yesterday.

780
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,980
Do you want me

781
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,860
to go to hell

782
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,180
with you?

783
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,980
Bro, listen,

784
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,340
I've been trying

785
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,380
to take over Tuan Island from you.

786
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,780
But I swear to god...

787
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,660
I swear to god,

788
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,900
I've never wanted to kill you.

789
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,540
Another group of people

790
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,820
want your life

791
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,940
and Tuan Island.

792
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,860
The problem is

793
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,340
they're hiding

794
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,780
in the dark.

795
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,780
You're bound to lose.

796
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,540
How am I supposed to

797
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,620
believe you?

798
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,220
Enough.

799
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,300
I don't care.

800
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,540
Anyway,

801
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,500
I'm leaving Binjiang tonight.

802
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,740
If you want to know the truth,

803
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,300
come here alone.

804
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,340
Still this number.

805
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,180
See?

806
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,460
I told you.

807
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,820

808
