00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,540
(Nine years ago)

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,400
Dad.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,080
Bin.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,360
You promised me
you'd be a police officer.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,200
You must keep your word.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,160
Dad.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,400
I worry about you the most.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,880
After I'm gone,

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,080
you can't just rely

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,840
on your sister and Bao.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,040
You need to learn

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,360
to be a responsible man.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,400
The police force

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,520
is the best place for you.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,680
Once you put on the uniform,

16
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,080
you won't be afraid of anything.

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,120
Being a police officer

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,520
is also an honor.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
Bin.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
Dad.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
Promise me

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,240
you will

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,520
pass this honor on.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,960
Don't worry.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,600
I promise you.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,880
I'll manage to get
into the police academy

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,900
and become a police officer.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,440
- Liang.
- Dad.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,280
Liang.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
- Dad.
- Liang.

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,920
Liang.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
Liang.

33

34
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,060
=Episode 9=

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,320
Mr. Xing.

36
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,400
We traced the number

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,720
in Sun Changhai's phone.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,720
The owner passed away two years ago.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,980
The account hasn't been closed.

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
There are no other issues for now.

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,360
By the way,
according to the base station,

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
his last call

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,880
came from Ninghai.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
Got it.

45
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Okay.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
Mr. Xing.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,360
There's a call from home.

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,280
Something's wrong with Dian Lao'er.

49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,800
Uncle Long showed up again.

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,840
I warned you a long time ago.

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
They have a family business.

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
It'll cause a lot of trouble.

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,800
They also said

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
that you betrayed them twice,

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,360
and one of them was arrested
because of you.

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,360
They want one million from you.

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
If you don't agree,

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
next time, it won't just be a dog

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
that gets killed.

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,080
Killing a dog?

61
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,640
Things are getting more interesting.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,200
We caught Sun Changhai
in less than four hours,

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,440
without releasing
any information to the outside.

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,200
Then Uncle Long's call came in,

65
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,040
and it was a direct threat.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,680
This is a signal being sent to us.

67
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,280
A signal?

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,720
At this critical moment,

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,960
they're causing trouble in Binjiang

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,160
to distract us.

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,320
Our opponent is not simple.

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,800
Last time, it was Bao Chenyan.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
This time, it's Dian Lao'er.

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
Maybe

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,340
they're both just smokescreens.

76
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,120
Should I continue
interrogating Sun Changhai?

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,680
He won't say anything now.

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,920
Liu Yong,

79
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,040
you send someone

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,920
to get some info from Dian Lao'er.

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,920
Got it.

82
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,240
Contact Captain Zhou.

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,240
Tell him we're hosting a dinner tonight.

84
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,840
We'll release the news.

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,160
When this is done,

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
we'll return

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
to Binjiang tomorrow.

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,760
- OK, I'm going.
- Go on.

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
Come on, thank you.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,640
Thank you for your hard work recently.

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,920
Come on, cheers to you all.

92
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
- Thank you.
- No, Captain.

93
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,120
Good for you

94
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,640
to set me up like this.

95
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,040
How did I set you up?

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
Why did you call me here
for occasions like this?

97
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,720
No.

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,880
Mr. Xing asked me to invite you.

99
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,440
He cares about his image,

100
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,400
but he really cares about you.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,240
By the way,

102
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,560
look at the food.

103
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,880
There's fish and meat.

104
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,920
Just eat.

105
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,320
Brothers,

106
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,400
I'll toast with beverages.

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Here.

108
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,640
A toast to everyone.

109
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,000
Come on.

110
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,720
This young man looks unfamiliar.

111
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,080
I don't think I've met you.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
Captain Zhou.

113
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,850
Come on. Let me introduce you.

114
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,690
Let me introduce you.

115
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,110
This is Bin, one of us.

116
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,040
He came earlier than us

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,620
and got the situation first,

118
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,520
so you don't know him.

119
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,840
- No wonder.
- Right.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,080
During the Hegu arrest,

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,440
he was the one

122
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,490
who worked with Liu Yong.

123
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Now I know.

124
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,700
You're a good-looking man.

125
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,480
If I'd met you,
I should've remembered you.

126
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,960
Bin, toast to Captain Zhou.

127
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,680
- Bin, let's drink.
- Captain Zhou.

128
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,040
- Here.
- Together.

129
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,960
Come on, Captain Zhou.

130
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
Let's drink.

131
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,160
- Sit.
- Okay, you eat.

132
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Captain Zhou.

133
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,660
Let me toast you individually.

134
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,560
We really appreciate your help
these days.

135
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,940
- Come on.
- The least I could do.

136
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,820
Thank you.

137
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,620
I'll drink to that.

138
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,860
Captain Zhou,

139
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,580
we've basically

140
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,260
wrapped things up here.

141
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,460
We're going back to Binjiang tomorrow.

142
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,980
During this time,

143
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,620
thank you so much.

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,660
You're too polite.

145
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,820
But there's one more thing
I need to trouble you with.

146
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
We may need to keep Sun Changhai
in your custody

147
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,780
for a little longer.

148
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,020
Once his injuries are healed,

149
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,700
we'll send people over to take him.

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,540
Would that be okay?

151
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,260
Just let him stay here.

152
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,980
Mr. Xing, don't worry.

153
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,940
Hey,

154
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,020
you haven't found the gun?

155
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,900
Still working on it.

156
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,420
So, you're rushing back for a lead?

157
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,940
Yes, in Binjiang.

158
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,220
We've got the exact location.

159
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,380
Otherwise,

160
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,620
we wouldn't be in such a hurry.

161
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,100
It's to avoid complications.

162
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,140
Congratulations.

163
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,580
Captain Zhou, would you like
to say a few words?

164
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,980
Okay, I'll say a few words.

165
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,220
Everyone, please quiet down.

166
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,660
Captain Zhou has something to say.

167
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,760
Okay.

168
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,020
Mr. Xing, let me say a few words.

169
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,860
Please go on.

170
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,820
Thank you for your hard work
during this time.

171
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,860
Congratulations to everyone
for completing the task

172
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,420
and achieving excellent results.

173
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,420
Second, still the same thing.

174
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,540
Work builds relationships,

175
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,300
and relationships push work forward.

176
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,220
All criminal police are one family.

177
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,300
- Mr. Xing, cheers!
- Cheers!

178
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,660
Brothers, cheers!

179
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,140
- Here.
- Cheers!

180
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,490
Cheers.

181
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,540
It's a dead-end.

182
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,460
Let me come out.

183
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,900
I didn't see you.

184
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,100
I'm going out. Quiet.

185
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,740
They're right here, come on.

186
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,250
- Run!
- Brothers.

187
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,380
The boss asked me
to check on the patient.

188
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,540
What's the use of checking?

189
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,970
Reimburse me
for the medical fees.

190
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,620
I'll reimburse you for your work injury.

191
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,540
Don't you know how you got hurt?

192
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,460
How did I get hurt?

193
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,620
- Hurry up.
- Running.

194
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
They're almost here. What are you doing?

195
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,730
You...

196
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,580
What are you doing?

197
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,400
I came to see Tianyi.

198
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,420
He's doing well.

199
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,060
The doctor said
he'll be discharged soon.

200
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,740
I'm leaving tomorrow.

201
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,500
I'll ask the doctor later.

202
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,300
If it's okay, you all can come with me.

203
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,380
Okay, no problem.

204
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
I'll book the tickets and let you know.

205
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,300
Okay.

206
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,580
Rest well.

207
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,460
Okay, sis.

208
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,580
Walk her out.

209
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,220
Forget it.

210
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,620
Whenever you see my sister,

211
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,340
you act so timid.

212
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,580
Can she eat you?

213
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,860
Let me tell you.

214
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,620
My sister is very popular.

215
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,380
If you don't go now,
you'll regret it later.

216
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,500
Still not going?

217
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,740
My words have gone wasted, huh?

218
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,340
- Hurry up, go!
- I...

219
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,340
You two.

220
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,100
Such a bonehead.

221
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,180
The patient is fine now.

222
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
- Then...
- This is okay, right?

223
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,820
- Yes.
- Good.

224
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,220
He can almost be discharged.

225
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,140
Alright.

226
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,300
Thank you, doctor.

227
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,340
It's fine. I'll leave.

228
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,580
- OK.
- Contact me if needed.

229
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,060
I thought you left.

230
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,420
I was checking on Tianyi's condition
with the doctor.

231
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,620
What do you need?

232
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,220
Fan.

233
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,740
I...

234
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,060
I like...

235
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,540
From the first time I saw you,

236
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,500
I've liked you.

237
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,980
Can you give me a chance?

238
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,500
Bin,

239
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,500
you're Tianyi's good friend,

240
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,260
and that makes you my good friend.

241
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,020
I think

242
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,500
we're better suited to just be friends.

243
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,940
A lot of couples start out as friends.

244
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,540
I can tell

245
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,020
that your care for me

246
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,200
isn't just that of a friend.

247
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,020
Anyway, I won't give up.

248
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,340
I've never considered marriage.

249
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,860
You should find a good girl,

250
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,220
get married, have kids,

251
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,420
and live a good life.

252
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,180
So,

253
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,060
it's not going to work for us.

254
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,820
You understand.

255
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,860
I understand.

256
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,440
How about not getting married?

257
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,940
Let's just date forever.

258
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,220
Fan,

259
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,900
as long as I can be with you,

260
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,020
I don't care about anything else.

261
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,140
Can you give me

262
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,580
and us a chance?

263
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,780
I have one condition.

264
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,220
Tell me.

265
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,700
One condition is nothing.

266
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,940
I'll agree to a hundred.

267
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,060
Okay.

268
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,820
If you can get your position back,

269
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,300
I'll agree to be your girlfriend.

270
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,420
This will be quick.

271
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,460
Look, the suspect's been caught,

272
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,020
and we know where the gun is.

273
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,180
Anyway, trust me. It'll be done soon.

274
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,310
Alright.

275
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,540
You promised me anyway.

276
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,340
So,

277
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,540
let's make a pinky swear.

278
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,060
Childish.

279
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,380
Then...

280
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,700
Lao'er.

281
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,140
What's going on?

282
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,140
I've checked the surroundings.

283
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,660
It's secure.

284
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,220
Lao'er.

285
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,300
How about we just go all in
and fight them?

286
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,140
Don't worry.

287
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,420
As your brothers, we're not afraid.

288
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,460
We're not afraid.

289
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
You're not afraid?

290
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,660
I'm afraid, okay?

291
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,180
I've been in this game
since I was sixteen.

292
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,160
I've cracked open other people's heads,

293
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,740
and I've had blood drawn by others.

294
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,020
But back then,

295
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,980
as long as you had the guts

296
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,660
and dared to fight,

297
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,780
you could rise up.

298
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,940
Even if...

299
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,940
Even if you had bad luck

300
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,100
and died,

301
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,700
what would it matter?

302
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,260
At least you wouldn't have to live
such a miserable life.

303
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,980
But now it's different, brother.

304
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,580
We've made it.

305
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,980
Now we live with dignity.

306
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,980
We have food and clothes.

307
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,300
If we get killed by them now,

308
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,180
is it worth it?

309
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,780
No.

310
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,700
Besides,

311
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,260
if we die now,

312
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,060
it's a waste, you got it?

313
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,820
Lao'er, you're not afraid of Bao.

314
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,860
Why are you afraid of him?

315
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,540
Do you know who Bao is?

316
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Bao

317
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,860
values principles

318
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,980
and follows the rules.

319
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,300
When something happens,

320
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,220
he faces it head-on.

321
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,260
Tuan Island is about money.

322
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,660
I'm not afraid of them,

323
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,620
but these jerks...

324
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,220
What kind of people are they?

325
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,540
They play dirty.

326
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,740
They'll stick to you

327
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,220
like a dog's skin plaster.

328
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,000
So, Lao'er,

329
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,900
are we

330
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,340
just going to keep being afraid?

331
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,180
You're not afraid?

332
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,260
You go and kill him then.

333
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,500
I'll give you one million.

334
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,860
No, two million.

335
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,900
Anyway,

336
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,380
I'm not short on money now.

337
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,140
Lao'er,

338
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,780
we have money in the account,

339
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,500
but that money isn't ours.

340
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,700
It's in my account.

341
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,380
It's money
for Tuan Island's special use.

342
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,340
Take some out

343
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,380
for urgent use now.

344
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,780
I tried, but it didn't work.

345
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,380
I couldn't take out a single cent.

346
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,220
Not a single cent?

347
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Yeah.

348
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,460
How pathetic.

349
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,260
What are you doing?

350
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,380
You acted like a zombie.

351
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,580
You scared me.

352
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,180
Sorry, sorry.

353
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,260
Look how sleepy you are.

354
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,100
Go rest in the lounge for a while.

355
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,780
- No need.
- I'm on my rounds.

356
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,660
You're on your rounds?

357
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,100
Then keep an eye on things for me.

358
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,300
I'll just wash my face.

359
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,820
Alright, hurry and come back.

360
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,660
Thanks.

361
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,940
Meeting in such a sneaky way,

362
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,740
are you doing something shady again?

363
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,780
Look, look.

364
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,220
You chose this place.

365
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,740
Why not our bureau? So afraid now?

366
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,460
I'm fine.

367
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,900
Boss,

368
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,540
is there something urgent?

369
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,020
I thought you needed something
from me.

370
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,900
I'm fine.

371
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,740
- Really?
- I...

372
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,900
What could I have?

373
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,780
Is this necessary?

374
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,060
You're well-known in the underworld.

375
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,820
You just lost a dog.

376
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,500
Why are you so scared?

377
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,260
How do you know?

378
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,900
I know a lot more than you think.

379
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,700
Not only did you lose a dog,

380
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,700
but someone

381
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,220
also left you something.

382
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,070
Right?

383
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,180
Not telling me?

384
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,860
Alright.

385
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,740
We're all busy.

386
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,460
Let's go home then.

387
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,020
By the way,

388
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,660
for your information,

389
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,020
I'll be busy in the coming days.

390
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,500
I won't have time to look after you.

391
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,100
Take care of yourself.

392
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,100
I don't want to hear

393
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,260
any murder cases

394
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,980
in which you're the victim.

395
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,060
I'll tell you, okay?

396
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,110
Gonna tell me?

397
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,500
- I'll tell you.
- Go on.

398
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,660
- Gui.
- What's going on?

399
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,660
The dog's dead.

400
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,780
Out of nowhere,
a crossbow bolt appeared.

401
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,380
There must be poison on it.

402
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,460
We even found

403
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,420
a bullet at the front gate.

404
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,090
Bao,

405
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,000
if you're dissatisfied

406
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,220
with the shares I got,

407
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,160
then come at me.

408
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,420
Why did you kill my Huang?

409
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,380
That's nothing to brag about.

410
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,240
What a jerk!

411
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,300
Take care of the burial.

412
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,700
Sure, Lao'er.

413
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,700
(Unknown: Follow the rules,
or it won't be a bullet.)

414
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,500
(Bao is your warning.)

415
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
This is

416
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,820
what happened.

417
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,630
Where's the bullet?

418
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,700
Let me see.

419
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,740
I have one request.

420
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,540
No matter what,

421
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,620
you have to find a way

422
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,300
to help me solve this problem.

423
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,420
I caused this mess

424
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,900
to cooperate with you.

425
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,780
- If something happens to me...
- Dian Lao'er.

426
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,420
You can't say that.

427
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,260
If I remember correctly,

428
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,180
you brought them here.

429
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
You've got the info from me.

430
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,780
You can't leave me to handle it alone.

431
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,700
Why am I here
if I don't want to help you?

432
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,040
But if I want to help you,

433
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,140
will you cooperate?

434
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,420
Of course.

435
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,580
I'll cooperate.

436
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,560
Then where's the bullet?

437
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,940
I won't forget it.

438
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,380
Xing.

439
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,540
(Unit Chief's Office)

440
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,780
The bullet has been identified.

441
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
The serial number
matches the one Bin lost.

442
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,240
But there's something strange.

443
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,620
If this opponent

444
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,060
is only after money,

445
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,860
there's no need to reveal the gun.

446
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,480
Now, they are

447
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
showing the clues
about the gun so blatantly.

448
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
Why?

449
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,900
To intimidate Dian Lao'er?

450
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,940
From the current situation,

451
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,620
it's to provoke the police.

452
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,860
To provoke us?

453
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,140
Why?

454
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,180
What's the benefit for them?

455
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,260
Alright.

456
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,340
I'll notify you immediately

457
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,300
as soon as I get any news.

458
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,180
Alright.

459
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
Lao'er.

460
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,060
They've replied?

461
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,620
It really is that gun?

462
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,700
What should we do now, Lao'er?

463
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,740
They're not just trying to scare us.

464
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,020
Last time, they killed a dog.

465
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,900
What about next time?

466
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,700
Don't make such a big deal out of it.

467
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,260
Since I started

468
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,940
with this job,

469
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,380
I've seen everything.

470
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,940
Wild Jiang.

471
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,740
He's ruthless, right?

472
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,980
Pretty arrogant, huh?

473
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,660
Now,

474
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,660
who knows
what he has become in this life?

475
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,540
But I am

476
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,780
still standing

477
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,900
firm here.

478
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,700
Want to mess with me?

479
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,620
They'd better think twice.

480
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,660
Really?

481
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,780
Of course, I'm up.

482
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,060
Show me then.

483
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,840
I want to know how scared he was.

484
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,230
Luo Tianyi.

485
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,780
Tell me.

486
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,300
Really?

487
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,260
What a mess.

488
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,460
There's a jerk.

489
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,180
Alright, I just got home.
I'll pack my things.

490
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,140
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

491
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,900
Wu called me

492
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,300
and told me some explosive news.

493
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,180
Want to hear it?

494
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,380
Do not tell me.

495
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,980
Oh, the mighty you.

496
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,600
Fine, I won't tell you.

497
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,940
Alright, I'll tell you.

498
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,420
Someone wants to target Dian Lao'er.

499
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,900
Is that strange?

500
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,780
Just look at Dian Lao'er.

501
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,780
He always greets the leaders

502
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,940
and thanks the leaders.

503
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,300
Everyone's annoyed at suck-ups.

504
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
You didn't get what I meant.

505
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,140
Someone wants to use this
to target him.

506
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,900
What do you mean?

507
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,580
They want to use a gun!

508
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,260
Is that strange enough for you?

509
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,500
Are you sure?

510
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,820
I'm absolutely sure.

511
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,460
He just called me and told me this.

512
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,380
If it were me, I'd shoot directly.

513
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,140
No need to bother with sending a bullet.

514
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,060
It's not logical.

515
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,980
I'll ask him for more details.

516
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,420
Hello?

517
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,300
Boss.

518
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
It's me.

519
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,100
I really need the money urgently.

520
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,340
I can't delay any longer.

521
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,900
- Slow down.
- That's it.

522
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,910
Binbin,

523
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,410
how did you end up like this?

524
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,260
Quick, quick.

525
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,960
Let him lie on the couch.

526
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,980
How much did you drink?

527
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,380
What's going on?

528
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,040
How much did he drink?

529
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,720
He's been drinking non-stop.

530
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,820
We couldn't stop him.

531
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,880
It was a welcoming party
for him and Tianyi.

532
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,750
We were all so happy.

533
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,800
But somehow

534
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,260
he got upset and drank too much,

535
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,220
asking to see his brother-in-law.

536
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,300
See his brother-in-law?

537
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,660
Let Xing Liang come out!

538
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,860
Xing Liang, come out!

539
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,100
How dare you mess with me?

540
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,620
Is this how you want to see him?

541
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,640
I think you really need to sober up.

542
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,460
Sis, we'll leave first.

543
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,580
Sorry for the trouble.

544
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
What happened? You're a mess now.

545
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,310
Hurry up.

546
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,380
Slow down. Drink slowly.

547
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,940
Slow down.

548
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,260
You shouldn't drink so much
if you can't handle it.

549
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,540
Your face is all hot.

550
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,100
What happened to you?

551
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,860
Sis.

552
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,780
Let go.

553
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,780
Quite strong, huh?

554
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,020
Let go. If you don't,

555
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,580
I'll use my trump card.

556
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,020
Three...

557
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,940
Two...

558
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,980
Sis.

559
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,700
You're an adult now.

560
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,860
Why are you still acting

561
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,900
like a kid?

562
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Sis,

563
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,580
do you think I'm useless?

564
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,540
Who said that?

565
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
I did.

566
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,460
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have been suspended

567
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,260
and got screwed up.

568
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,900
Who screwed you up?

569
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,380
She promised me.

570
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,700
I was so happy.

571
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,900
But in the end, it was all for nothing.

572
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,540
I...

573
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,220
I'm really useless.

574
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,740
Enough, enough.

575
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,060
Just get some rest. You'll feel better.

576
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,460
Whatever happens, I'm here for you.

577
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,540
If you could be more efficient,

578
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,860
we would've long got Tuan Island.

579
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,820
Now it's all a mess,

580
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
and you still come here

581
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,260
and have me clean up your mess?

582
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,020
(Qi Hanchen
Chairman of Qi Investment Group)

583
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,140
Yes, yes.

584
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
But it's not all my fault

585
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,540
that it hasn't been handled properly.

586
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,260
You introduced Uncle Long to me.

587
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,940
Uncle Long introduced Lan Zai to me.

588
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,140
Things have come to this.

589
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,140
I can pay the money.

590
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,900
Okay, thank you.

591
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,900
Thanks a lot.

592
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,770
But

593
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,060
you have to finish your business first.

594
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,860
Alright.

595
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,980
Then we have no choice.

596
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,900
I'll take my leave now.

597
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,460
Bao, let me tell you. You don't know.

598
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,260
At that time, I used the steering wheel

599
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,180
to block the car,

600
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,460
and then I chased him.

601
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,900
I almost caught his hand.

602
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,030
Unfortunately,

603
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,180
a motorcycle zoomed past me

604
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,740
and knocked me away.

605
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,060
But luckily,

606
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,180
it hit me.

607
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,660
If it had been Wen Binbin,

608
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,940
he would have died on the spot.

609
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
Let me tell you, Tianyi.

610
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,820
When I was your age,

611
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
I was just like that,

612
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,140
fighting and getting beaten up

613
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,580
every day.

614
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,660
Pretty tough.

615
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,700
Bao, no one praises people like you.

616
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,020
Where's Binbin?

617
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,140
He drank too much last night.

618
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,280
He's probably still asleep.

619
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,260
- I'll call him.
- No, no.

620
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,260
Don't call him.

621
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,060
Let him get some good rest.

622
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,900
This time,

623
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,780
when you went to Ninghai,

624
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,820
I was firmly against it,

625
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,220
but since you went,

626
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,300
the outcome wasn't bad.

627
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,540
Bao,

628
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,780
Bin's trouble

629
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,980
is now completely resolved.

630
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,980
Should we start tackling

631
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,060
the company's troubles now?

632
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,820
The company's troubles?

633
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,620
Wait, Bao.

634
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
What's going on?

635
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,780
Nothing serious.

636
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,140
Of course, it's serious.

637
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
Right now,
we're under attack from all sides.

638
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,140
Dian Lao'er

639
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,500
has found a powerful backer

640
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,300
and is determined to take
the Tuan Island project.

641
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
He's got

642
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,580
Aunt Chen's shares.

643
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,940
No one can guarantee

644
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,020
he won't get more shares.

645
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,540
If there are twenty more people
like Aunt Chen,

646
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,780
that's 4% of the shares gone.

647
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,300
I think

648
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,180
Aunt Chen's situation

649
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
is special.

650
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,300
It won't happen again.

651
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,980
We've been working

652
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,820
at the Tuan Island market for years.

653
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,780
These old vendors are our old friends.

654
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,820
There's trust.

655
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,140
I'm confident.

656
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,780
Confident?

657
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,700
Confident about what?

658
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,260
If you were truly confident,

659
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,940
he wouldn't have got Aunt Chen's shares.

660
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,020
4% of the shares

661
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,660
might seem insignificant,

662
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,500
but at a critical time,

663
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,380
the result could hinge
on those few shares.

664
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,140
Tu Manjiang,

665
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,380
you can absolutely talk,

666
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,460
but can you mind your tone

667
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,740
when speaking to Bao?

668
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,340
What?

669
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,060
What's wrong with my tone?

670
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,940
Man,

671
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,300
you're right.

672
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,620
This issue

673
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,260
is more complex than I anticipated.

674
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,260
How about this?

675
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,740
You talk

676
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,980
to the vendors

677
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,620
we're familiar with

678
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,220
in the market.

679
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,940
If you can't convince them,

680
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,140
I'll personally step in

681
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,780
and talk to them myself.

682
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,710
How about that?

683
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
There's no time, Bao.

684
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,260
There are only ten days left.

685
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,380
Ten days until the bidding meeting.

686
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,500
I'm genuinely worried.

687
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,860
We still don't know

688
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,900
who Dian Lao'er's

689
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,540
backer is.

690
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,900
Judging by Dian Lao'er's actions,

691
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,020
this person's financial strength

692
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,820
is not to be underestimated.

693
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,830
Bao,

694
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,060
I suggest

695
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,450
our company bring in
external funding asap.

696
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,920
We can't delay anymore.

697
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,660
Let me think about it.

698
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,790
Let me think about it.

699
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,700
Bao, I know
what you're concerned about.

700
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,500
You're worried
that bringing in external funds

701
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,620
will raise the stall rents

702
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,720
and harm the interests of the vendors.

703
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,700
Right?

704
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,420
Don't worry.

705
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,540
I'll handle the negotiations

706
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,300
and try my best to avoid that.

707
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,140
Okay?

708
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,420
Time is really tight.

709
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,620
We can't hesitate any longer.

710
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,140
- Bao...
- Bao said

711
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,980
he'd think about it.

712
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,060
Why are you so anxious?

713
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,700
Do you want
to make the decision for him?

714
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,700
If you think I'm incapable,

715
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,100
you take over.

716
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,900
That's easy for you to say.

717
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,740
I don't know what you're talking about,

718
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,280
and I surely can't take over.

719
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,860
But I do know Bao said

720
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,300
he'd think about it.

721
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
So why are you in such a rush?

722
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,420
We're all brothers here.

723
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,620
Can we speak calmly?

724
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,620
All our assets

725
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,580
have been invested in this project.

726
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,580
If we fail,

727
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,740
all our efforts

728
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,100
will go to waste.

729
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,380
And the old vendors

730
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,620
are counting on us.

731
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,720
If this project falls
into Dian Lao'er's hands,

732
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,620
their situation will truly be dire.

733
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,380
Bringing in external funds

734
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,640
is the only solution
I can think of right now.

735
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,510
This is the extent of my ability.

736
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,060
You decide.

737
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,660
Alright.

738
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,140
Tell me.

739
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,930
Do you have someone in mind?

740
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,700
The Wen family.

741
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,220
Their business empire is vast.

742
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,700
This is the best option

743
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,570
I can think of.

744
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,980
Anyone but the Wen family.

745
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,580
Do you have another alternative?

746
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,060
I do.

747
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,920
I mentioned this to you before.

748
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,950
It's Haicheng.

749
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,800
No problem.

750
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
Now,

751
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,420
call them right away and get in touch.

752
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,780
What's wrong?

753
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,100
You look down.

754
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,260
Man,

755
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
you've worked hard.

756
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,920
It's not hard on my heart,

757
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,380
but it's hard on my life.

758
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
Hello?

759
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,820
Uncle Long.

760
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,460
I'll give you

761
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,580
the one million.

762
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,780
Glad you've thought this through.

763
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,340
As long as you're alive,

764
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,220
money can still be earned.

765
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,380
Yes, yes.

766
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,380
I've made up my mind.

767
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,900
(Surveillance; Inside the hospital room)

768
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,660
I won't forget it.

769
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,100
I won't forget what?

770
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,860
It seems

771
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,860
that Sun Changhai's relationship
with this person

772
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,580
is more complicated than we thought.

773
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,460
Look at this.

774
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,100
It looks like a necklace or something.

775
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,020
Could this be

776
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,700
some sort of token

777
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,980
between them?

778
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
Any new leads

779
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,940
from Ninghai regarding this person?

780
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,380
Nothing yet.

781
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,260
But Xing, look.

782
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,980
(Surveillance; Inside the hospital room)
From the build,

783
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,300
it seems like a woman.

784
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,780
But according to the nurse's memory,

785
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,140
the voice

786
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,820
sounded like a man's.

787
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,540
Could it be a voice modulator?

788
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,280
Or is it

789
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,880
a man who looks like a woman?

790
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,180
Talk.

791
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,140
Sir,

792
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,260
there's news.

793
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,740
They are

794
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,020
coming to collect the money tonight.

795
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,400
Where?

796
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,910
At my house.

797
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,140
Your house?

798
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,090
Yes.

799
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,140
They wanted it

800
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,100
to be at my house.

801
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,420
Okay, I understand.

802
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,580
Go to his house for the money?

803
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,100
What does he want to do?

804
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,660
He's got guts.

805
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,060
Liu Yong,

806
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,280
tonight, take a few people with you

807
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,210
and go check it out.

808
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,110
Alright.

809
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,780
Sit.

810
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,370
What's the rush?

811
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,500
First, have some tea.

812
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,180
I need a favor from you.

813
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,020
What do you need?

814
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,780
Just tell me.

815
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,020
Can you help me?

816
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,340
Of course.

817
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,280
No problem.

818
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,460
Tell me.

819
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,100
Count me in for the Tuan Island project.

820
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,480
Why do you want to join
the Tuan Island project?

821
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,620
Are you backing out now?

822
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,620
No, no.

823
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,060
I just don't understand why

824
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,950
you suddenly wanted

825
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,810
to participate
in the Tuan Island project.

826
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,220
The project comes with money.

827
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,220
Why wouldn't I want to participate?

828
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,660
The Tuan Island project

829
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,860
is really complicated and risky.

830
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,660
And you know Dian Lao'er.

831
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,020
He's a madman.

832
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,420
I've considered

833
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,380
all of that.

834
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,940
To be honest, after all these years

835
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,820
in business,

836
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,300
I've seen it all.

837
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,340
Though the Tuan Island market

838
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,300
is no longer connected
to the Wen family,

839
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,500
it's where my dad started.

840
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,820
When I handed it over to you,

841
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,620
I hoped you'd make it
bigger and stronger.

842
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,220
But now,

843
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,780
it's about to be swallowed up
by someone else.

844
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,440
Could I just stand by and do nothing?

845
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,540
After the bidding, I'll withdraw.

846
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,060
Don't let it happen again.

847
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,260
I understand.

848
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,100
I've drafted the cooperation contract.

849
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,640
Take a look and see if it's okay.

850
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,140
So soon.

851
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,900
You've even got the contract.

852
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
Hurry up.

853
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,740
If there's no issue,

854
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,340
(Investment Agreement)
sign it.

855
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,900
What are you hesitating for?

856
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,460
It's not about anything else.

857
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Think about the vendors
in the Tuan Island market.

858
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,060
They've been with you
for almost twenty years.

859
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,900
As long as the project isn't settled,

860
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,460
they won't have peace.

861
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,700
Now, only the two of us joining forces

862
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,420
can get the Tuan Island project.

863
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,940
Only then will those little punks

864
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,550
like Dian Lao'er stop causing trouble.

865
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,060

866
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,660
