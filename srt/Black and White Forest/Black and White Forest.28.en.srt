1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,700
(Zeng Zhijiang)

2
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,300
(Zhan Xiaotu, Zeng Guolong)

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,680
It's been such a long time.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,960
You miss me, right?

5
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,930
Do you not

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,400
recognize me anymore?

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,640
I've changed my appearance

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
and also changed my name.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
My current name

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,360
is Tu Manjiang.

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,680
I specially chose a character

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,600
from your and Jiang's names.

13
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,320
I swore

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,590
they will definitely pay the price.

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,940
I will only do one thing from now on,

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,970
to take revenge for you.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,910
(The gang was eradicated)
(Last December,)

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,440
(I sent Changhai to steal Wen Binbin's gun)

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,240
(and waited for the right time to act.)

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,200
Jiang, someone wants me to deal with Bao.

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,160
Uncle Long, I will arrange for this killer.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,440
(An unexpected opportunity)

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,640
(made me change my original plan.)

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
(I took the opportunity)

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,240
(of Lao'er to scare Bao Chenyan,)

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,040
(allowed Sun Changhai to retrieve the gun)

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,160
(and planned to kill Bao with this gun.)

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,640
The gun has been sealed for two months.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Once it rings, it can't be stopped.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,200
Don't forget Mr. Jiang's kindness.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
I will not forget.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,640
It's your turn.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
Big Eye Chen!

34
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,290
The photos have been taken.

35
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,880
I will send them to you now.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
No need.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,110
Print out the photos

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,110
and send a package.

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,500
To whom?

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,380
Criminal Investigation Unit.

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,540
Got it.

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,860
Don't worry.

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,300
In case something happens,

44
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,100
I'll raise

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,210
your child.

46
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,910
Officer,

47
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,460
I dare not risk the lives of Hui

48
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,180
and our child.

49
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,340
You must protect them well.

50
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,340
Where is that gun?

51
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,460
In the ditch by Dawang Village.

52
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,940
About 300 meters

53
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,660
north from the bridge head.

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,980
Uncle Jiang,

55
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,060
I know you will take revenge for me.

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,780
I'm willing to help you.

57
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,220
By the way, let me introduce.

58
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,860
This is that friend I mentioned

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,380
to you before, Uncle Jiang.

60
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,140
Uncle Jiang.

61
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,180
(The plan is proceeding as scheduled.)

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,180
(I must make the Wen family)

63
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,260
(disappear from Binjiang.)

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,840
(Let's get to know each other again.)

65
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,500
(Tu Manjiang.)

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,540
So it's you.

67
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,300
=Black&White Forest=

68
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,300
=Episode 28=

69
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,540
You go and find out clearly

70
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,900
where the people from Dan An Alliance

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,100
who caused trouble last night are now.

72
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,060
I can't.

73
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,700
Bin,

74
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,820
it's not that I don't want to help you.

75
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,940
Those people are too ruthless.

76
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,540
Er'leng's leg was broken yesterday.

77
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,860
In our area,

78
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,260
I haven't seen such ruthless people.

79
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,100
Who should I ask?

80
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Didn't you say

81
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,630
there haven't been such fierce people

82
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,780
in our area for a long time?

83
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,860
The goal is very clear.

84
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,380
I believe in your abilities.

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,420
Oh no.

86
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,820
It's not that you believe in me.

87
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,700
It's that I don't believe...

88
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,020
Don't play the victim here.

89
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,140
Before it gets dark,

90
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,220
I want to receive the message.

91
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,340
(Bihaihui Hot Spring Health Spa)

92
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,420
It was so cold just now,

93
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,620
but it's so hot now.

94
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,500
Do you want to let me go

95
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,580
or deal with me?

96
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,780
Bao.

97
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,420
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

98
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,220
Sweat steaming

99
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,380
costs money.

100
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,180
Very expensive.

101
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,460
I want to go home, Bao.

102
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,580
I want to go home...

103
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,060
Lin Yisheng,

104
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,780
I advise you

105
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,260
to leave Binjiang

106
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,620
as soon as possible

107
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,100
and not come back again.

108
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,100
I'm telling you,

109
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,660
if I see you once,

110
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,140
one part of your body will be missing.

111
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
I keep my promises.

112
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,900
What did you just say, Bao?

113
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
You're really letting me go?

114
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,700
Yeah.

115
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,300
The driver is downstairs.

116
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,860
The car is going to the airport.

117
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,980
I've already booked the ticket.

118
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,820
Hurry up.

119
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,500
Then I really...

120
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,770
- Hurry up.
- Ok.

121
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,540
- You may miss the car.
- Bao, I'm leaving.

122
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,780
You can't catch the plane.

123
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,620
Hurry up.

124
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,860
Bin.

125
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,660
Bin, I'm leaving first.

126
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,260
Bao, why is he here?

127
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,940
You know Liu's license plate number, right?

128
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,430
Lin Yisheng has gone to catch a flight.

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,940
Lin Yisheng went towards the airport.

130
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,540
The license plate number

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,740
is Hai A8WC88.

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,470
Take off the mask.

133
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,940
Mr. Lin.

134
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,860
(Detention Warrant)

135
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,470
Chen Yiming, during your coma,

136
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,260
we have arranged for people

137
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,460
to protect your wife and your kid.

138
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,580
Tu Manjiang has already been exposed

139
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,900
and is being wanted.

140
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,380
Do you have anything else to say?

141
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,940
Chen Yiming,

142
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,180
your child is still so young.

143
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,510
Openly confess to receive leniency.

144
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,260
Strive to see them soon.

145
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,500
Bao is wrongfully accused.

146
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,180
It wasn't me who helped Sun Changhai escape

147
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,100
and killed Wu Ajin and Dian Lao'er.

148
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,220
Tu Manjiang threatened me with Hui and our kid,

149
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,180
asking me to take on all responsibilities

150
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,340
after I dealt with the car and the gun

151
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,580
and then framed it on Bao.

152
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,780
That's all I know.

153
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,740
Hello?

154
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,780
Bin.

155
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,900
I have found them.

156
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,100
Send me the location.

157
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,980
Ok.

158
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,700
Found them?

159
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,260
Could you not tell Xing Liang

160
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,140
about Zheng Haotian's place for now?

161
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,140
Well...

162
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,820
I need

163
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,060
to meet Zheng Haotian

164
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,900
and discuss something

165
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,580
with him.

166
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,740
Please do me this favor, ok?

167
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,460
A buddy of mine

168
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,140
has his leg broken

169
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,380
by your people yesterday.

170
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,860
How should we settle this?

171
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,660
How?

172
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,460
I have three nephews,

173
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,300
two dead, one being imprisoned.

174
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,660
How should I settle this with you?

175
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,900
Let me tell you,

176
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,540
I didn't bring my people here today

177
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,540
and didn't call the police either.

178
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,220
I ran all the way to come here.

179
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
I think

180
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,980
you

181
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,550
are worth me making this trip

182
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,050
and having a talk nicely.

183
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,940
Since you put it that way,

184
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,820
let's have a chat.

185
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,660
You're someone who follows the rules.

186
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,780
Come with me.

187
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,020
You wait for me in the car.

188
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,580
Bao.

189
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,300
Are you ok?

190
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,820
Zheng Haotian

191
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
has left.

192
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,900
We exchanged some information.

193
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,740
The previous misunderstanding and the cause

194
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,550
of his nephew's death are clarified.

195
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm getting old and confused.

196
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,780
I was provoked by someone,

197
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,380
and I believed it.

198
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,900
It's my fault for being too casual.

199
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,060
I will give you an explanation.

200
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
I want to know

201
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,980
the whereabouts of Tu Manjiang.

202
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,380
I don't know where he is.

203
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,020
But I have his phone number.

204
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,420
Let me take a picture.

205
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,900
Ok.

206
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,300
I do have one request for you.

207
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,380
Where are that guy surnamed Qi

208
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,140
and that guy surnamed An?

209
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,660
They should be

210
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,420
at the Guanhai Tea House.

211
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,740
Listen to me.

212
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,820
Go to the Guanhai Tea House now

213
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,900
and block him in the parking lot.

214
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,100
You may catch them.

215
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,780
This is Qi Hanchen.

216
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,620
This is his phone number.

217
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,460
I remember.

218
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,780
Although

219
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,860
it's not like the past,

220
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,900
some rules still need to be followed.

221
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Do you understand?

222
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,340
I do.

223
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,620
This time,

224
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,740
I was in a hurry to come here.

225
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,620
I forgot to check the calendar.

226
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,740
Do you think I'll die here?

227
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,700
We still have important things to do.

228
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,420
What things?

229
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,900
Find Tu Manjiang.

230
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,860
Hello?

231
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,060
Hello?

232
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,800
Hello?

233
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,180
Man,

234
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,980
can you hear me?

235
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,420
We've been brothers for so many years.

236
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,220
I give you a chance.

237
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,260
Come out and meet me.

238
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,250
Let's talk privately.

239
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,740
(Mr. Lin)

240
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,420
My son was arrested by the police.

241
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,260
They have also taken the money back.

242
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,700
Is this what you mean by peace and safety?

243
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,940
Do you think it's fine to keep silent?

244
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,700
This debt,

245
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,100
just wait and see.

246
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,740
Most of the people

247
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,340
standing here today

248
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,900
are old merchants

249
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,140
and old friends

250
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,740
of our Chamber of Commerce.

251
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,820
To put it bluntly,

252
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,220
for me,

253
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,140
you are like my family.

254
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,940
I know

255
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,860
you were scammed out of money

256
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,220
because you believed in me.

257
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,980
I feel very sad

258
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,140
about this.

259
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,100
Today,

260
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,660
I still have the face to stand here

261
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,700
and talk to you all.

262
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,140
It's because

263
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,420
our people have covered

264
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,260
your money.

265
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,100
- Great!
- Great!

266
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,960
Thank you, Bao.

267
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,140
Thank you, Bao. Thank you.

268
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,460
Everyone,

269
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,780
stand in a line

270
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,260
and get the money.

271
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,460
Listen to me.

272
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,900
With Hui as the mark,

273
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,860
stand in four lines.

274
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,580
- Stand still.
- Four lines.

275
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,540
Move inside.

276
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,980
Ok, let's start.

277
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,300
Don't worry, everyone, don't worry.

278
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,620
- All money is back.
- Thank you.

279
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,140
- Ok.
- Thank you.

280
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,060
Thank you.

281
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,540
We'll head back then.

282
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,620
Ok, make sure to keep it well.

283
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,540
Don't rush, don't rush.

284
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,740
- Next.
- This is me.

285
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,540
- It's just right.
- 60,000 yuan.

286
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,860
-Thank you.
- Thank you, Bao.

287
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,750
- Thank you, Bao.
- I got it.

288
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,260
- 40,000 yuan, right?
- 40,000.

289
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,100
Come on.

290
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,260
How did my dad instruct you

291
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,340
before he passed away?

292
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,180
How did you promise him?

293
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,020
I can understand.

294
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,320
In the past, you needed

295
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,820
to use some extreme measures,

296
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,780
but now that you've decided to change,

297
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,330
those means can no longer be used.

298
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,410
(Zixuan,)

299
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,060
(I might not be able to fulfill the promise.)

300
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,660
(Starting from kidnapping Lin Yisheng,)

301
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,740
(I had no way back.)

302
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,060
(I know there's a problem with the money.)

303
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,540
(I will bear all the consequences.)

304
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,260
Are you still not going to say anything?

305
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,980
You really don't cherish the opportunity.

306
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,580
What's the situation?

307
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,420
Mr. Xing,

308
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,220
two batches of people have been here,

309
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,460
including Mr. Yang.

310
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,780
But he still didn't saying anything.

311
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Yu,

312
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,620
go through

313
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,780
extending detention procedures.

314
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,300
- Ok.
- Ok, go ahead.

315
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,340
Mr. Xing.

316
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,380
An encrypted network number.

317
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,300
I suspect it's Tu Manjiang.

318
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,020
Get it through.

319
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,780
How is it on your side?

320
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,900
Is everything going smoothly?

321
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,140
He came in smoothly.

322
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,700
We are communicating.

323
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
You should be almost here too.

324
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,700
Tu Manjiang,

325
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,060
I want to follow up with you

326
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,340
on the latest news.

327
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,580
Zheng Haotian's gang

328
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,520
has been brought to justice.

329
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,540
Qi Hanchen is under investigation.

330
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,300
The route you'll take to flee

331
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,630
has been sealed off.

332
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,180
To surrender

333
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,620
is your only way out.

334
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,620
Xing Liang,

335
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,450
I'm afraid you don't have the ability.

336
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,380
Did you hear it?

337
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,140
Let's talk about it.

338
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,620
The death of the Sun brothers

339
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,340
was related to An Zhihui.

340
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,100
My leg is trapped. Can't you see it?

341
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,940
My leg...

342
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,860
Do you know how you rode the bike?

343
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,180
Can motorcycles violate rules?

344
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Isn't it easier for four wheels

345
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,820
to avoid danger than two wheels?

346
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,420
Nonsense.

347
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,980
You shouldn't violate the rules either.

348
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,700
There's a car in front. Shouldn't I brake?

349
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,540
Cao.

350
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,580
You are the one who hit me.

351
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,460
You have a point, do you?

352
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,940
Hit...

353
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,060
It's fine.

354
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,300
I was driving normally, but he stopped me.

355
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,900
Are you serious?

356
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,060
See.

357
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,100
- Don't ask anymore.
- I can't move.

358
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,340
I guess he's trying to scam.

359
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,380
Nonsense!

360
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,500
30,000 yuan, right?

361
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,340
Be careful.

362
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,190
Here you are.

363
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,030
Ok.

364
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,100
Next, next.

365
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,140
Next.

366
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
What's your name?

367
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,980
Zixuan.

368
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,860
Bao,

369
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,180
it's me,

370
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,620
Tu Manjiang.

371
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,900
Ms. Wen is here with me.

372
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,580
Come over and chat.

373
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,180
Remember

374
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,260
that only you are allowed to come.

375
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,780
Otherwise,

376
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,620
I will immediately kill Wen Zixuan.

377
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,140
Man...

378
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,340
- 20,000.
- 20,000.

379
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,820
Ok, thank you.

380
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,100
Next, next.

381
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
What is your name?

382
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,220
Help me do it.

383
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,060
Ok.

384
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,740
Hello? Bao, where did you go?

385
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,180
Binbin,

386
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,700
I have to go out for a while.

387
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,900
You supervise them

388
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,620
to distribute that money

389
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,260
to everyone this afternoon.

390
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,100
I might...

391
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,540
I might...

392
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,940
Going out for a while.

393
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,020
If there's something,

394
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,580
discuss with Wu

395
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,620
and Er'leng.

396
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,660
Do you know?

397
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,860
Take good care of yourself

398
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,180
and them.

399
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,100
Bao,

400
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,500
where are you now?

401
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,460
I'll go find you first.

402
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,140
You can't find me.

403
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,410
Don't find me anymore.

404
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,700
I'm hanging up.

405
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,620
Hello? Liang.

406
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,560
Bin.

407
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,420
Bao Chenyan sent me a location just now.

408
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,500
But he didn't answer my phone.

409
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
He sent you the location?

410
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,860
Hurry up and take people there.

411
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,300
I'm worried he will have an accident.

412
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,660
That's what I'm worried about too.

413
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,460
You go there first with your people.

414
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,860
Send me the location.

415
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,340
Hello? Man.

416
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,620
I've arrived.

417
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,500
Where are you?

418
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,860
Get off.

419
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,180
The factory on the right.

420
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,780
Go inside.

421
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,900
(Monitor
Guangshun Electromechanical Factory)

422
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,420
Bao,

423
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,940
here.

424
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,820
Do you see the bombs?

425
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,860
There are eight more here.

426
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,020
The remote control is in my hand.

427
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,620
As long as I press it lightly,

428
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,660
this place will turn into ruins.

429
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,980
You know a disaster shouldn't

430
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
get the family involved.

431
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,900
The grievances between the two of us

432
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,060
has nothing to do with Zixuan.

433
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,380
Replace her with me.

434
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,060
Is it ok?

435
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,300
Do you have the right to negotiate with me?

436
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,300
I have no right to negotiate with you.

437
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,580
Come at me.

438
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,700
Bao,

439
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,700
if it weren't for the matter of Jiang,

440
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,380
we might have become very good friends

441
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,820
or

442
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,220
harmonious partners.

443
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,260
But you caused the death of Jiang.

444
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,820
We can only become mortal enemies.

445
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,100
Do you know how many ways I have thought of

446
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,540
to kill you in the past twelve years?

447
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
But I found out you are truly

448
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
a man of loyalty and righteousness.

449
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,340
So,

450
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,660
as a former buddy,

451
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,500
today,

452
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,380
I will keep you until the end.

453
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,660
Let you be the last to die.

454
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,980
Man,

455
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,180
because of the matter of Jiang,

456
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
you take revenge on me.

457
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,100
No problem, it's normal.

458
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,900
How about this?

459
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,860
I'll stay.

460
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,220
You can kill or chop me

461
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,180
as you wish.

462
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,540
Let her go.

463
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,220
No rush.

464
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,460
We still have time.

465
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,260
There is still a lot to say.

466
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,420
Bao,

467
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,420
where are you?

468
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,980
Binbin.

469
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,030
Right there.

470
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,220
Binbin.

471
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,510
Binbin.

472
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,340
Sister.

473
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,460
Sister.

474
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Binbin.

475
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,620
Tu Manjiang,

476
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,490
you heartless person,

477
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,700
quickly release my sister.

478
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,950
Otherwise, I'll make you suffer.

479
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,790
Bin.

480
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,180
Here you are.

481
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,740
There are bombs here.

482
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,460
Your life or death is in my hands.

483
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,380
Bao Chenyan.

484
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,700
Why didn't you tell me it was so dangerous?

485
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,900
Is this how you treat your buddy?

486
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,900
How did you find this place?

487
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Who asked you here?

488
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Do you always think I'm causing trouble?

489
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,220
Do you think I'm particularly useless?

490
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,980
You are really helpful to us today.

491
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,140
I'm not like you.

492
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,660
Your hands are full of blood.

493
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,420
Wen Binbin,

494
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,380
of course, you can be

495
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,260
a good person.

496
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,580
How fortunate you are!

497
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,570
You never worry about clothing and food.

498
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,580
Someone is indulging you.

499
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,620
Someone is protecting you.

500
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,580
And someone cleans up the mess for you.

501
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,540
If I had your good luck,

502
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,420
I could also be a righteous and kind person.

503
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,620
Many people suffer more than you

504
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,020
in this world.

505
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,860
They did not commit any crimes.

506
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,180
The road you walk with Wild Jiang

507
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,100
is the one you chose yourself.

508
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,540
You are right.

509
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,060
The road

510
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,620
is a choice I made.

511
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,960
Bao,

512
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,500
you just said

513
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,260
you want to exchange a life for a life?

514
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,740
All right.

515
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,540
I'll give you a chance.

516
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,180
You make a choice.

517
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,700
Choose...

518
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,420
The siblings of the Wen family are all here.

519
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Only one person can leave here alive.

520
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,580
It has nothing to do with Binbin.

521
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,620
He was only 13 when Wild Jiang kidnapped him.

522
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,110
I'm begging you.

523
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,940
It has nothing to do with him today.

524
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,460
He can't go through this again.

525
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,580
Let him go.

526
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,420
He is innocent.

527
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,620
I don't want to hurt innocent people.

528
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,140
Things have developed to this situation today.

529
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,420
It wasn't my intention.

530
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,620
But when I think of my sis and her husband,

531
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,260
I just feel

532
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,740
that you are not that wronged either.

533
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,460
After all,

534
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,380
when the avalanche happens,

535
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,380
no snowflake is innocent.

536
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,820
Your lives

537
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,860
are all in Bao's hands.

538
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,940
Who can live and who must die,

539
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,260
it's up to him.

540
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,460
Bao,

541
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,660
nothing to think about.

542
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,330
Let my sister go.

543
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,410
- I'll stay.
- No.

544
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,300
You leave quickly.

545
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,180
Bao, let him go, let him go!

546
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,500
Let him go...

547
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,700
Binbin,

548
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,420
do you believe me or not?

549
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,980
Man,

550
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,180
Mr. Man,

551
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,020
I admit defeat.

552
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,860
I've followed you for so long.

553
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,540
I've never seen you bend your back.

554
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,380
Today

555
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,140
you kneel down for the two of them.

556
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,620
It's a pity

557
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,420
you are not kneeling to my family,

558
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,260
so,

559
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,740
you still have to choose.

560
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,780
Between these two people,

561
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,940
how should I choose?

562
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,220
Everyone says

563
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,020
the society is about human relationships.

564
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,700
It's actually about reciprocity.

565
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,540
I got rid of Wild Jiang

566
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,020
and you want my life.

567
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,380
I don't blame you.

568
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,620
But Man,

569
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,700
we've been brothers for more than ten years.

570
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,260
I dare to say

571
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,460
that I have never done...

572
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,220
Bao!

573
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,220
...anything to let you down.

574
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
You want me to surrender,

575
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,740
so I kneel.

576
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,020
You want...

577
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,060
If you want their lives,

578
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,420
I will give you my life.

579
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,180
Zhan Xiaoman,

580
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,940
you have been surrounded by the police.

581
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,820
We have understood all your criminal facts

582
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,740
and gathered the evidences.

583
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,620
Don't resist any longer.

584
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,340
Zhan Xiaoman!

585
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,500
(Police)

586
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,420
Xing Liang,

587
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,980
I will tell you three things.

588
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,860
First,

589
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,820
there are many bombs here

590
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,820
and the remote control is in my hand.

591
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,260
Second,

592
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,700
Bao has been stabbed.

593
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,660
He is lying on the ground.

594
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,700
Third,

595
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,860
your wife and your brother-in-law

596
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,780
are all here with me.

597
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,100
I hope

598
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,300
you come in too.

599
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,500
Put down the equipment and the gun.

600
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,940
Only you are allowed.

601
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,300
Zhan Xiaoman...

602
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,420
Bao,

603
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,900
actually, you don't have to do this.

604
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,220
As long as Xing Liang is willing to come in,

605
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,380
I will let

606
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,820
the two of them go.

607
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,020
It's just

608
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,780
I don't know if he is willing or not.

609
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,460
Get the snipers in position.

610
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,700
The demolition expert will be here soon.

611
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,660
- I'm going in.
- Ok.

612
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,780
You play it by air.

613
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,100
Xing,

614
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,420
it's too dangerous.

615
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,380
Cut the crap!

616
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,940
Bring me the listening device.

617
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,140
Be safe.

618
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,100
Mr. Xing, be safe.

619
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,140
Play it by air.

620
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,140
Zhan Xiaoman,

621
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,620
I am Xing Liang.

622
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,340
Zhan Xiaoman!

623
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,380
- Xuan.
- Stop right there.

624
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,340
Xing Liang,

625
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,460
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

626
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,900
Zhan Xiaoman,

627
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,660
let them go.

628
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,180
If you have any requests, we can discuss.

629
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,100
You finally know who I am.

630
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,500
I have spent twelve years

631
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,420
in carefully arranging this game.

632
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,340
I will never let it fail,

633
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,220
so,

634
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,380
Xing Liang,

635
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,860
I advise you not to act rashly.

636
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,660
As long as I gently press this button,

637
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,500
they

638
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,060
and the police outside

639
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,780
will all accompany me to the grave.

640
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,090
Liu Yong,

641
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,500
when will the demolition expert arrive?

642
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,660
He's on the way.

643
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,780
Calm down a bit.

644
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,940
Zhan Xiaoman,

645
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,460
let me tell you,

646
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,940
you just need to plead guilty right now,

647
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,140
there is still a way out.

648
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,140
Don't use those words to fool me.

649
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,180
I know what I've done.

650
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,700
To be honest with you,

651
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,180
I never planned

652
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,180
to get out alive today.

653
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,660
If you don't want more people to die,

654
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,660
then let the people outside

655
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,060
step back.

656
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,620
There're really all bombs.

657
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,710
Ok.

658
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
I promise you.

659
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,380
Bao...

660
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,660
Everyone,

661
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,380
back off.

662
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,500
Everyone, back off.

663
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,740
(Monitor
Guangshun Electromechanical Factory)

664
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,580
Did you see that?

665
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,220
Our people have evacuated.

666
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,100
Can you release them now?

667
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,220
Bao just said

668
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,860
one life for one life.

669
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,980
But he had no choice,

670
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,660
so he has become like this now.

671
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
I am fair.

672
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
I'm giving you a chance now.

673
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,660
You stay

674
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,620
and I let both of them go.

675
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,420
If you are not willing,

676
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,300
I'm not forcing it either.

677
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,020
Don't...

678
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,340
I have already given you the chance.

679
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,180
Wait a moment.

680
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,860
Ok.

681
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,060
I'll stay.

682
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,340
Let them go.

683
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,020
Bin.

684
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,580
Take your sister away quickly.

685
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,700
Hurry up.

686
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,980
Binbin...

687
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,460
Binbin...

688
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,540
Go...

689
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Go...

690
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,420
Go...

691
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,980
Hurry up.

692
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,820
Sis.

693
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,780
Come on.

694
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,740
Bao...

695
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,020
- Go.
- Bao...

696
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,980
Go...

697
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,660
Let them walk on their own.

698
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,980
It's ok.

699
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,460
Xing Liang,

700
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,060
Bao Chenyan,

701
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,980
I've been waiting for this day

702
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,580
for twelve years.

703
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,860
Twelve years.

704
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,420
Twelve years ago,

705
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,260
one of you was an undercover

706
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,780
and the other one was hatchet man.

707
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,500
You guys hit

708
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,580
and caught people.

709
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,540
Especially my sister and her husband.

710
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,980
They were just two innocent farmers.

711
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,540
You didn't even let them go.

712
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,500
You tell me

713
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,060
if you should be dead.

714
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,340
I understand how you feel.

715
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,220
But are they really that innocent?

716
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,180
Although he didn't directly participate

717
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,780
in the criminal activities of Wild Jiang,

718
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,380
when

719
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,940
helping Wild Jiang escape,

720
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,540
he attacked the police.

721
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,660
This has constituted a crime.

722
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,500
Speaking of innocence,

723
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,900
what about those merchants on the island?

724
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,700
When you took

725
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,780
their property away,

726
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,380
have you considered their innocence?

727
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,700
It was they who betrayed Wild Jiang.

728
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,700
They should be punished.

729
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,180
They deserve it.

730
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,900
Bao!

731
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,380
Bao!

732
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,700
Bao!

733
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,340
Bao!

734
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,980
All right.

735
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,580
Everything is coming to an end.

736
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,380
Just let me

737
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,140
give you a final judgment.

738
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,940
I said before

739
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,780
let Bao be the last to die.

740
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,380
So, Xing Liang,

741
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,220
I'm sorry.

742
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,740
