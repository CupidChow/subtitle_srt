1
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,740
(Thirteen years ago)

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,920
They'll be home soon.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,280
Mom.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Son.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,450
I was so scared.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,920
Does it hurt?

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,760
Dad.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,800
Glad you're back safely.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,120
Take Bin upstairs

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,720
to rest for a while.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,120
Okay.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
Let's go, son.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,160
Bao,

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
I really owe you this time.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
Uncle,

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,600
I can't stay by your side anymore.

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,880
What happened?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Get up. Speak properly.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,060
Uncle,

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Bin's kidnapping is my fault.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,640
I have no face to stay

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
by your side anymore.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,660
I'm going to Binjiang.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,440
I want to kill Wild Jiang.

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Bao,

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
you came to me from our hometown.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
I've always

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
treated you like family.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,600
Tuan Island

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,480
is where I started my career.

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
Unless absolutely necessary,

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,640
I won't give it up.

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,960
But now I'm getting old.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
There are many things

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,900
I want to do but can't.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,040
If you can take back Tuan Island,

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,560
it'll be yours.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Here.

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,480
I don't want it, Uncle Wen.

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,840
I don't want it. I can't take it.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
No need to say more.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,080
This is settled.

43
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
Bao,

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
I know you.

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,640
When you've made up your mind,

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,560
I can't stop you.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,640
But today,

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
I have three things

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,680
I want you to remember.

50
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,280
First,

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,640
once you step onto this path,

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,080
there's no turning back.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,200
Think it through.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,440
Second,

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,960
people do things,

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
but Heaven watches.

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,840
No matter which path you take,

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,560
don't do anything
that dishonors your ancestors.

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,480
Third,

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,440
being a leader

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,880
is not just about fighting and killing.

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,960
You also need to be understanding,

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
kind, and responsible.

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,340
(Equity Gift Agreement)
Take it.

65
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,100
(Bao Chenyan becomes the controller.)

66
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Uncle,

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,780
I got it.

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,960
Uncle Wen,

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
take care of your health.

70
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,420
=Black&White Forest=

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,380
=Episode 7=

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
Hello?

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,240
Who's this?

74
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,440
Calling me so late.

75
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,640
Is this Mr. Xing Liang?

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,360
You're really free today.

77
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Hello?

78
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,960
Are you listening?

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,480
I can hear your breathing.

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,400
You're so quiet.

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,720
Looks like you need something.

82
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,520
Could it be that you need something

83
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,360
from me?

84
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,400
There's something

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I need you to help with.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
What's going on?

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm really not used

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,880
to the way

89
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520
you're talking to me.

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
Is it because

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
of the Ninghai case?

92
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,160
I asked a friend to find
a connection there.

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
Not this.

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
It's about Xuan.

95
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,100
So he usually loves

96
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,280
to play mahjong there, right?

97
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,640
Yes, yes.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Okay, how about this?

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
I'll handle some matters

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
and come find you later.

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,160
- Alright, I'll go first.
- Okay.

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,200
We'll talk on the phone.

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
Wait for my call.

104
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,800
You've got it?

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,880
What did you ask?

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
At such a place,

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,680
how can you go straight

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
to Da Lele?

109
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,680
Da Lele can only be called that

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,820
once she's outside the door.

111
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Here,

112
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,420
there are only Nancy, Lily,

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,630
Vivian, Tiantian,

114
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,850
Yaoyao, and Peach.

115
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,880
At such a place,

116
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,040
you really have special value.

117
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,280
I can't be bothered to explain.

118
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,440
If such a thing happens,

119
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,000
it's understandable

120
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
that Zixuan is anxious,

121
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
right?

122
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,360
You also know

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,280
Binbin is her weak spot.

124
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,480
Please understand her.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,320
I think the priority now

126
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,600
is to send people

127
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,520
to guard Binbin.

128
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,840
Don't let anything happen to him.

129
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,680
Second,

130
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,000
I think

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,580
Da Lele can definitely help.

132
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,280
Once I get the phone,
I'll give it to you.

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,000
Your people need
to contact her now.

134
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,040
I'm about to leave now.

135
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,480
I'll go find Zixuan.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
I'll make sure to stop her.

137
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,680
Don't worry, okay?

138
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,900
(Ninghai City Map)

139
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,400
Hey.

140
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Fei Zai.

141
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,640
You

142
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
go check on Bin.

143
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Keep an eye on him.

144
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,920
If anything happens,

145
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,080
call me immediately.

146
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,560
- Understood.
- Go.

147
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,080
In this unfamiliar city,

148
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
with you,

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
I feel like I have
someone to rely on.

150
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,320
You're Bao's friend.

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,400
No need to be polite.

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,230
Let me tell you.

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,820
The people from Da An Alliance
are fierce.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,080
Don't think of them as scrap collectors.

155
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,240
Talk to them properly.

156
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,920
Don't worry, sis.

157
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
Sis,

158
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,900
since you're so familiar with him,

159
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
why don't you join us?

160
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,560
My mahjong hasn't even finished yet.

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,160
Should I...?

162
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,120
No, sis.

163
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,600
Why trouble you
with such a small matter?

164
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
I'll handle it myself.

165
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,160
Little brat.

166
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,120
This isn't a place for you two to play.

167
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,440
Get out.

168
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,960
Don't you know

169
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,880
why I came here so late?

170
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,720
What's it to you

171
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,800
whether I know or not?

172
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,560
I told you to get out.

173
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
We've got a big deal on our hands.

174
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,120
A batch of tough goods.

175
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,960
We need some tough people.

176
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Get lost.

177
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,760
Why are the people around Coyote

178
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
like this?

179
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,140
Stop!

180
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,840
Do you know Coyote?

181
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Where the hell has he been these days?

182
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,040
I had to come

183
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,920
to such a place.

184
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,080
He's not answering his phone!

185
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,560
That's not right.

186
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,280
Gu Dadao, his work contact,

187
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,800
has been in Ninghai.

188
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,520
- What?
- Hai.

189
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,420
Come here. I need to talk to you.

190
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
You two wait for me.

191
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,070
I'll be back soon.

192
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,120
What's up?

193
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,000
Hai,

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,520
I was talking about these two fools.

195
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
These fools

196
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,520
were asking my brother
about you guys today.

197
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,320
I came here just to remind you.

198
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
Brothers.

199
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,040
Get him!

200
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,040
Get him!

201
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,120
Get him!

202
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
Get him!

203
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,400
Let me ask you.

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,840
You just said

205
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Coyote's contact person was in Ninghai.

206
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,110
What's going on?

207
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,610
Sir,

208
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,880
can you speak louder?

209
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,010
I'm asking you.

210
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,000
You just said

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,060
Coyote's contact person was in Ninghai.

212
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,320
What's going on?

213
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,670
Sir,

214
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,220
his name is Gu San.

215
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,080
Everyone calls him

216
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,270
Gu Dadao.

217
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,000
He's a relative of Coyote.

218
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,670
Call him out.

219
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,000
Call him now.

220
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,580
Alright.

221
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,660
San.

222
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,940
Mr. Xing,

223
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,540
news from Captain Zhou.

224
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,660
After the investigation,

225
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,400
they found Sun Changhai
riding a motorcycle

226
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,540
three hours ago

227
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,260
on Majiatun Road.

228
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,660
Majiatun?

229
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,580
(Majiatun Road)

230
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,580
Repeat what I just taught you.

231
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,820
He's Wen, and you're Luo.

232
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,020
I'm Wen. He's Luo.

233
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,540
You two are

234
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,740
from Xue City.

235
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,300
You're in the trade business.

236
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,460
You've got a batch of cars

237
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,180
to send to Da An Alliance.

238
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,540
You need some tough people.

239
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,540
Wait, I'm getting confused.

240
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,260
What's going on here?

241
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,060
What does your unit chief mean?

242
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,620
Mr. Chen,

243
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,540
what's confusing about this?

244
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,780
It's like this.

245
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,420
The guy ahead

246
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,580
is from another squad of our bureau.

247
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,620
He's investigating this suspect

248
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,220
from a different angle.

249
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,340
We're just

250
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
gathering intel from all sides

251
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
for more details.

252
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
We've turned on the siren.

253
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,500
Is this a covert or overt operation?

254
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,300
Well...

255
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,060
This...

256
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,660
It's both.

257
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,620
It depends, right?

258
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,260
A pro.

259
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,580
(Bamao Kebabs, Wankelai Restaurant)

260
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,300
San,

261
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,300
eat while it's hot.

262
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,540
Still hot.

263
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,100
San,

264
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,620
these two are the ones I told you.

265
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,980
They came from Xue City.

266
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,620
My two brothers.

267
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,220
Well,

268
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,220
friends come from afar.

269
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,060
I'll drink first. Cheers.

270
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,900
Make yourselves comfortable.

271
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,020
- Come on.
- Come on, bro.

272
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,900
Come on.

273
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,740
San.

274
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,620
Brother.

275
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,420
(Fei Zai)

276
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,020
Mr. Wen,

277
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,580
need people to transport goods?

278
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,940
San,

279
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,740
I'm in the international
second-hand car trade.

280
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
We have a batch

281
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,340
- of goods.
- 30,000 each.

282
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,220
200,000 for the leader.

283
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,420
As long as you are strong enough,

284
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,360
money's not a problem.

285
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,260
Da An Alliance, Pingtang.

286
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,300
How many do you need?

287
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,020
We want... Do you know Coyote?

288
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,940
Waiter,

289
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,060
the kebabs are cold. Heat them up.

290
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,860
Get us some cold beers.

291
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,820
Who do you want?

292
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,020
Coyote.

293
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,300
How do you know him?

294
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,780
Well.

295
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,940
Forget how I know him.

296
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,860
San.

297
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,940
Here's the thing.

298
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,620
We had a friend from Xue City.

299
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,640
He used Coyote's services.

300
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,580
We're told he's good.

301
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,900
Since we're all friends,

302
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,300
we thought

303
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,340
we could...

304
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,180
My people are reliable.

305
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,620
Since you've found me,

306
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,420
I'll arrange people for you.

307
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,260
Don't be picky.

308
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,420
Deal?

309
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,340
Of course.

310
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,660
It's been many years.

311
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,420
I trust my friend's words.

312
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,220
I've got a batch

313
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,340
of 30 cars.

314
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,040
The time and people

315
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,820
are up to you.

316
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,780
I won't have objections.

317
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,300
We're friends now.

318
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,500
Friends' business

319
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,420
is always continuous.

320
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,060
Friendship lasts long.

321
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,140
Come on, brothers.

322
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,660
I'll drink. You feel free.

323
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,700
Come on.

324
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,660
San.

325
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,860
But we need

326
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,540
the goods to be safe.

327
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,660
San, you're straightforward.

328
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,020
Brother,

329
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,980
sit here.

330
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,780
I'll go check the kebabs.

331
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,420
If we can't get it,

332
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,300
be ready to force it through.

333
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,220
(Fei Zai)

334
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,140
What's going on?

335
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,020
Mr. Xing, the police station's backup

336
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,780
will take at least 20 minutes to arrive.

337
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,450
The situation is unclear.

338
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,940
Fei Zai doesn't have enough manpower.

339
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,700
Should we warn Bin?

340
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,340
Dao.

341
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,400
Come.

342
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,740
These kebabs should be hot.

343
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,540
There are two more over there.

344
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,180
I'll go check.

345
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,140
Don't stop drinking.

346
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,100
Come on.

347
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,500
Come on.

348
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
Let's drink.

349
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,460
Got a WeChat message from Bin.

350
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,820
He said to hold off.

351
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,940
He's got a plan.

352
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,080
Alright, drink.

353
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,560
Alright, alright.

354
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,540
I told you.

355
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,660
The drinking scene is full
of relationships and customs.

356
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,020
Learn from San.

357
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm learning today, right?

358
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,060
San,

359
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,980
Bin is my dear brother.

360
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,180
His business is my business.

361
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
Is my business

362
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,820
your business?

363
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,380
Whether your business

364
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,300
becomes my business

365
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,060
depends

366
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,660
on your performance

367
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,900
tonight.

368
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,380
San,

369
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,220
I won't say anything more.

370
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,460
Now I see your abilities.

371
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,500
Let's drink together.

372
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,120
Cheers.

373
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,780
San,

374
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,820
you introduced

375
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,420
Coyote to my friend earlier.

376
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,620
He's really impressive.

377
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,300
For my batch this time,

378
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,820
you can't do it worse than Coyote.

379
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,420
Coyote is useless.

380
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,500
He can't even clean his own mess.

381
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,720
Always causing trouble for me.

382
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,420
How could this be?

383
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,620
But you can handle it, right?

384
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,580
No problem. It's nothing.

385
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,500
San, you're really good.

386
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,620
Let me toast to you.

387
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,700
Sure.

388
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,460
Cheers.

389
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,900
San,

390
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,540
after his trouble,

391
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,020
is he in his hometown

392
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,980
or in Baigouzi?

393
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,100
When did Shaba change its name
to Baigouzi?

394
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,180
When did he go there?

395
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,680
(Shaba)
Why are we talking about this?

396
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,780
- Let's drink.
- Come on.

397
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,620
Liu Yong.

398
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,450
- Cheers, bro.
- Contact Captain Zhou.

399
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,140
Ask the Shaba police
to cooperate with us.

400
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,820
- Set up a precise search.
- Yes.

401
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,420
- Let's enjoy drinking.
- Alright.

402
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,860
San, we're happy today.
Let's enjoy drinking.

403
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,820
(Shaba)

404
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,420
Cheers!

405
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,620
Where's the restroom?

406
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,980
What's wrong? Can you find it?

407
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,860
I'll show him.

408
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,820
It's okay.

409
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Where are you going?

410
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,780
Nothing.

411
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,620
We're happy today.

412
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,580
(Ninghai Public Security Bureau)

413
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,420
Mr. Xing,

414
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,980
Mr. Zhou got something.

415
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,340
After a full investigation
into Gu Dadao,

416
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,940
especially his three phone numbers,

417
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,980
we retrieved the call logs

418
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,220
and found some clues.

419
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,780
We focused on Gu Dadao.

420
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,180
He made 13 calls today.

421
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,590
After verifying
the cell tower locations,

422
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,660
only the last number

423
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,700
appeared in Shaba.

424
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,100
Sun Changhai

425
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,820
still doesn't know
Gu Dadao's been exposed.

426
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,420
Based on the information we have,

427
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,820
this number from Shaba

428
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,420
should belong to Sun Changhai.

429
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,860
Here's the plan.

430
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,900
You guys go apply

431
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,140
for the location

432
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,380
of this number.

433
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,460
Also,

434
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,380
you two,

435
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,700
go to Shaba later.

436
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,940
Keep in touch with me.

437
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,860
- Alright.
- Go.

438
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,850
Sir, are you eating? How many people?

439
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,700
Hello.

440
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm here to ask about someone.

441
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,380
Look.

442
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,980
Have you seen this person?

443
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,660
Yes, yes.

444
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,120
He's eating on the second floor

445
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,980
in Room 205.

446
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,100
Are you sure?

447
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,060
Yes.

448
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,540
Evacuate the customers now!

449
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,380
Quick!

450
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,140
Boss,

451
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,940
I found the target.

452
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,540
(Stove Resto)
You two, guard the door.

453
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,860
Everyone else, follow me in.

454
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,680
What's going on at the door?

455
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,060
Everything's normal.

456
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,020
(Ninghai Public Security Bureau)

457
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,180
The person making the call

458
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,660
must be Sun Changhai's accomplice.

459
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,460
We entered at 11:55.

460
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,900
Look, the phone rang
three minutes later.

461
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,920
This phone number has been
calling Sun Changhai

462
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,700
for the entire past week.

463
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,700
And the location trail shows

464
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,460
it went from Binjiang to Ninghai.

465
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,980
Could this be

466
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,820
the mastermind behind it?

467
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,700
Gu Dadao,

468
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,140
you've come in for the third time.

469
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,780
How many more times

470
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,080
do you plan to come in?

471
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,000
When you stop arresting me,

472
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,780
I won't be able to come in anymore.

473
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,940
You're new, right?

474
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,540
I've never seen you before.

475
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,260
Officer,

476
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,460
you said it yourself.

477
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,540
It's my third time,

478
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,900
right?

479
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,380
I know

480
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,140
a little about the law.

481
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,980
If you confess,

482
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,770
it will

483
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,100
make our job easier,

484
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,900
and it'll give you a chance.

485
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,940
Understand?

486
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,460
I've always been very curious.

487
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,980
Sun Changhai

488
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,200
exposed you

489
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,140
to protect

490
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,540
himself.

491
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,740
It's because of his uncle.

492
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,060
That's family.

493
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,980
Then

494
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,260
why are you

495
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,460
refusing to cooperate?

496
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,660
What's your reason?

497
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,300
Because of family too?

498
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,620
Family...

499
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,980
It's indeed our soft spot.

500
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,660
We always think

501
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,060
once we're adults,

502
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,500
we can be responsible for our actions

503
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,820
and do whatever we want,

504
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,900
not caring about ourselves.

505
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,000
But what about your family?

506
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,220
I've seen your profile.

507
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,260
You have a son.

508
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,420
He's only three this year.

509
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,300
You're living a carefree life,

510
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,710
but have you thought
about your son's feelings?

511
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,780
Do you want him to grow up

512
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,860
without a father?

513
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
To be pointed at

514
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,100
by his classmates

515
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,140
and colleagues

516
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,660
for the rest of his life?

517
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,600
Is that what you want?

518
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,140
(Liu Yong)

519
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,460
I'm a father too.

520
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,020
Ever since I had a child,

521
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,100
I really can't be so reckless anymore.

522
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,580
I have to think more

523
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,700
about what being a father

524
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,980
means.

525
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,700
To be honest,

526
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,980
I'm not afraid

527
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,380
of anything else.

528
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,220
I'm only afraid

529
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,260
that my kid

530
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,740
will forget me.

531
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,060
The older

532
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,620
the kid gets,

533
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,140
the farther away

534
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,460
he seems

535
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,460
to get.

536
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,780
Yeah.

537
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,420
We always think

538
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,780
of children

539
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,060
as little animals

540
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,300
who don't know anything.

541
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,940
Like

542
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,300
kittens,

543
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,980
puppies,

544
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,420
and bunnies.

545
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
As long

546
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,540
as they're not cold or hungry,

547
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
they don't care

548
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,540
about anything else

549
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,220
or remember anything.

550
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,660
But they do understand everything,

551
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,220
and they never forget.

552
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,060
Alright.

553
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,740
I'll speak.

554
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,900
Jinshui Bay

555
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,380
is

556
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,140
one of our contact points.

557
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,600
(Jinshui Bay Bath)
People in this line of work

558
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,860
always have their lives on the line.

559
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
We know how things work.

560
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,740
That's why

561
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,860
we never meet

562
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,100
with the boss directly.

563
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,580
There's always

564
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,260
a middleman,

565
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,820
and he decides

566
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,980
who's suitable.

567
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,300
Then he puts the file

568
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,220
into

569
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,740
the corresponding

570
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,020
locker.

571
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,180
And

572
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,220
we check that locker

573
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,860
at fixed times.

574
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,500
If we think

575
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,500
it's suitable,

576
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
we take the file

577
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,620
and lock it.

578
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,580
If it's not

579
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,740
suitable,

580
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,700
we'll figure out how to deal
with the file

581
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,180
and leave the locker open.

582
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,540
So,

583
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,180
Sun Changhai's original name
was Sun Hao.

584
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,380
He's Coyote.

585
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,620
You've been in charge

586
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,500
of his locker, right?

587
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,860
I don't know.

588
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,300
What do you mean?

589
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,660
Coyote

590
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,780
is ruthless

591
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,740
and violent.

592
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,380
Plus, he's very cautious.

593
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,380
He never

594
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,220
puts

595
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,980
all his eggs in one basket.

596
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,380
He chose me as the middleman

597
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,220
because

598
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,660
I took less.

599
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,180
So he'd make more.

600
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,980
In our line of work,

601
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,580
there's no trust.

602
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,300
It's all about using people.

603
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I am

604
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,820
just one of them.

605
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,620
Can you help me contact the person

606
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,780
who directly

607
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,340
gave the file to him?

608
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,860
I'll try.

609
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,780
It's all written down, right?

610
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,670
Pretty much.

611
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,020
Alright, we'll stop here for today.

612
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,500
Officer.

613
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,420
What's the matter?

614
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,820
You have a daughter.

615
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,680
Well,

616
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,780
you're good with your daughter,

617
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,100
right?

618
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,340
Yes.

619
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,500
It's pretty good.

620
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,740
(Tuan Island Market)

621
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,460
Bao,

622
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,900
I've asked around.

623
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,820
Dian Lao'er's company

624
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,420
received funding three months ago.

625
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,700
No wonder

626
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
he's got the confidence

627
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,180
to speak and act now.

628
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,180
Turns out there's a backer behind him.

629
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,220
Now that he's got money,

630
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,780
he's probably trying to get

631
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,460
the shares of the small businesses.

632
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,380
We need to come up with a plan.

633
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,510
How about this?

634
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,460
Go talk

635
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,700
to the old merchant friends.

636
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,060
If everyone is selling shares,

637
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,140
I'll take them all.

638
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,020
If they

639
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,300
don't want to sell,

640
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,100
I'll help everyone make money.

641
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,020
In short,

642
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,620
no matter what,

643
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,420
Dian Lao'er cannot

644
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,340
get any shares.

645
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,300
Man,

646
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,900
you'll have to work hard.

647
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,660
I'm fine.

648
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,020
I'll think about it.

649
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,590
When you cheat in my territory,

650
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,540
you should've known this would happen.

651
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
Lao'er, please spare me.

652
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,260
I beg you, I...

653
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,220
Hello?

654
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,100
Here, here.

655
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,540
I've got an idea for you.

656
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,500
Your mother

657
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,060
has shares in Tuan Island, right?

658
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,900
Let her use her shares

659
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,860
to exchange for your hand.

660
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,660
This deal's not a loss for you.

661
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,860
Of course not.

662
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,420
Come on.

663
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,940
(Moments)

664
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,020
(Jinshui Bay Bath)

665
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,500
(Happy Birthday.)

666
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,260
(Dear Daughter)

667
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,180
(Like; Comment)

668
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,980
(Liu Yong: The locker is locked.
Monitoring. Nothing wrong.)

669
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,100
Fei Zai.

670
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,460
Mr. Xing.

671
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
Contact Captain Zhou.

672
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,540
Tell him we want

673
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,500
to set up a point on the outside.

674
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,180
Ask him to send a group over.

675
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,500
Got it.

676
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,470
Hello, Captain Zhou?

677
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,820
(Dear Daughter)

678
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,220
We're at Jinshui Bay Bath now.

679
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,340
Please send a group of people over.

680
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,260
Thanks.

681
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,540
Fei Zai,

682
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,620
when you were eating with Bin,

683
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,980
you didn't mention anything
about this, right?

684
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,380
Mr. Xing, don't worry.

685
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,820
I didn't say anything.

686
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,660
But

687
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,540
Bin's really invested in this.

688
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,580
From what I know about him,

689
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,380
he'll try to figure out a way
to solve it.

690
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,260
Let him be.

691
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,180
Never mind.

692
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,660
I can't control him anyway.

693
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,100
Come on.

694
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,180
Aren't we trying to catch someone?

695
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,100
Why are we strolling
around the food street?

696
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,260
They are not

697
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,300
mutually exclusive, right?

698
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,900
What do you mean?

699
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,260
Let me ask you.

700
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,580
If you had to choose right now,

701
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,920
what would you want to eat most?

702
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,240
Claypot rice.

703
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,260
We don't have that here.

704
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,860
People's eating habits don't change.

705
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,260
You came from Binjiang to Ninghai.

706
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,620
You want claypot rice.

707
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,140
What about Sun?

708
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,500
He...

709
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,100
Fried chicken?

710
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,460
(Crispy Chicken; Special Fried Chicken)

711
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,300
See?

712
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,620
I'm like your father.

713
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,900
Just learn from me.

714
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,420
Are you crazy, bro?

715
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,820
There are many fried chicken shops.

716
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,260
Do you think you're filming a drama?

717
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,560
You just stand there
and he will come to you?

718
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,710
No, no, no.

719
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,020
There are a lot of shops,

720
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,500
but there aren't that many that fit

721
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,680
after filtering them.

722
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,680
How do you filter them?

723
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
Let me ask you.

724
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Does every action have logic?

725
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,020
So I think

726
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,940
Sun Changhai will eat at Crispy Chicken.

727
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,790
Not chain stores.

728
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,690
Do you know why?

729
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,100
To save money.

730
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,620
He doesn't lack money.

731
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,180
Then why?

732
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,540
Because this is a special time.

733
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,220
His priority must be safety.

734
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,780
Crispy Chicken

735
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,790
is great for avoiding phone orders,

736
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,220
and it's so remote.

737
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,260
It's the safest place for him.

738
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,060
What you said makes sense,

739
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,540
but there are too many shops

740
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,480
that meet the criteria.

741
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,460
How do you filter them?

742
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,640
So we have to do field research,

743
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,420
find the most probable place,

744
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,760
and wait for him.

745
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,500
Or do you have a better plan?

746
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,900
Do you think you're in a drama

747
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,420
and he's there when you turn around?

748
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,680
What if he's actually there?
