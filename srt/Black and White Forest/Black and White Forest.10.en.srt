1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,740
(Thirteen years ago)

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,560
Is this all you've got?

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,760
Are you looking down on me?

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,000
Wild Jiang.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,000
Listen carefully,

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,000
today,

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm going to hang

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,520
my company's plaque here and gain

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,280
a foothold in the market.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,280
Do you understand?

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,440
If nothing else,
pack your things and get out!

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Believe it or not,
I'll make a tablet for you today.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,160
Next year,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,640
I'll light incense for you,

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,920
and my men

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,040
will kowtow to your grave.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,280
Do you want it?

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,080
Kill him.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,560
- Go!
- Go!

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,180
=Black&White Forest=

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,180
=Episode 10=

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,520
Lele just called.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,930
She said the Suns might

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,360
send someone here to make trouble.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,000
She doesn't know the details.

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,720
I think

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,880
the Suns might know where the gun is.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,310
If we follow them,

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,360
maybe we'll get some clues.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,400
Maybe you should

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
contact Captain Zhou in Ninghai.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,400
At least find out who will come

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,480
so that we can keep an eye on him.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
I knew about it.

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,280
You knew...

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
Why didn't you tell me?

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
(Captain's Office)

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,880
Binbin,

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,640
why are you always so confident?

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,800
Why should I tell you?

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Fine, I'm telling you,

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
behave yourself,

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,080
and don't make trouble, okay?

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,720
You'll know
what you're supposed to know.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,120
Tell you?

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,010
In your eyes,

47
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,240
I'm just an idiot who can't go anywhere.

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
It's fun to fool me, right?

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,880
I was wondering why you

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,120
sent me to that place.

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
It turns out you wanted me

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,520
to distract them
and lure the person behind this.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
Did you have fun, Xing Liang?

54
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,640
Let me remind you.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
We've done all this

56
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,480
to help you

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,230
find the lost gun,

58
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,070
okay?

59
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,800
You have a reason to lie to me, right?

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Do you know I look like

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
an idiot who can only brag

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,320
because of this?

63
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,720
- You... I...
- Whose fault?

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,640
If you'd stayed calm

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,680
and hadn't made trouble,

66
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,720
would this happen?

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,280
Fine.

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,760
I can't change you,

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,760
but someone can.

70
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
Wait.

71
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,680
What... What does that mean?

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Don't try to threaten me
with your sister.

73
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,120
Scared?

74
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,280
Why would I be scared?

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Be a man.

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,640
Can you stop

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
threatening me with your sister?

78
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm not a child anymore.

79
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,900
My sister is busy with

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,780
working with Bao
on Tuan Island's project.

81
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,700
She had no time for us.

82
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
What did you say?

83
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,580
She's working with Bao Chenyan
on Tuan Island's project?

84
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,980
Well, you got a problem?

85
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,580
Nonsense!

86
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,060
Why did you throw...?

87
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,660
Liang!

88
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,300
Come on. Let's take a picture.

89
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,820
Be a man, okay?

90
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,140
We've signed it.

91
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,980
Come on.

92
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,300
Three, two, one.

93
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,220
How is it?

94
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,830
It's great.

95
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,100
Mr. Bao, Ms. Wen,

96
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,940
you will get the joint project

97
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,060
of Tuan Island.

98
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,580
Absolutely.

99
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,780
Absolutely.

100
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,020
Yes.

101
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,740
(Police)

102
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,580
Boos,

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,140
I remember

104
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,180
I tried so hard to chase Sun Changhai

105
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,220
because he ran so fast.

106
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,100
My left leg still hurts.

107
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,300
Will my right leg

108
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,740
get hurt this time?

109
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,140
Just be flexible.

110
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,780
The peripheral force is standing by.

111
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,980
They're ready to fight.

112
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,460
Fine.

113
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,860
19:25, Beijing Time.

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,420
Lao'er,

115
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,420
why is he coming here

116
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,580
to take the money?

117
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,300
It doesn't matter.

118
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,180
I've prepared

119
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,380
the money.

120
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,140
He can take it

121
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
as he wants.

122
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,700
Lao'er.

123
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,980
Will they accept the check?

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,580
He only said 1 million yuan

125
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,900
without specifying the form.

126
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,300
Besides,

127
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,100
it's not a fake check.

128
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,420
Why can't he accept it?

129
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,340
Wait, Lao'er.

130
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,020
The check can't be cashed.

131
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
It's fake.

132
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,860
I don't care.

133
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,580
(Cash Check)
What? Lao'er,

134
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,300
- well...
- Shut up.

135
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,860
You're talking too much.

136
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,540
I'll be honest with you.

137
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,100
Someone

138
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,580
will pay for this.

139
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,780
But now,

140
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,060
- there's no money.
- No money?

141
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,930
What?

142
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,060
Then why did you ask them over?

143
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,980
(Outside)

144
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,420
(They're outside.)

145
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,060
Outside?

146
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,180
The police?

147
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,140
The only thing we need to do

148
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,340
is

149
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,340
to cooperate

150
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,060
with the police

151
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,780
and let the cops

152
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,500
arrest them.

153
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,820
When they're released,

154
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,300
we'll get

155
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
the money.

156
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,620
Cooperate with me.

157
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,420
No problem.

158
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,020
19:30, Beijing Time.

159
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,180
(Taxi)

160
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,020
(Camera, Dian Lao'er's Yard,
Dian Lao'er's Door)

161
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,020
They just came in like that?

162
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,740
Boss,

163
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,700
are they being arrogant

164
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,660
or silly?

165
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,260
I think they're silly.

166
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
No one's here.

167
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,500
Where are they?

168
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,380
This room.

169
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,300
So many people.

170
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,460
Are they having a meeting?

171
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,350
Move.

172
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,660
Serve the tea.

173
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,500
(Police)
Dian Lao'er is funny.

174
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,780
Usually, he's

175
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,820
acting crazy.

176
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,460
I can't believe he got scared.

177
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,820
(Lao'er owes us 1 million yuan.)

178
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,380
My boss said you owed him
1 million yuan,

179
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,700
and that's the truth.

180
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,620
You can't deny it.

181
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,580
Money.

182
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,660
This...

183
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,100
I'm not sure

184
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,060
who wrote this,

185
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,060
but I'll

186
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,740
accept it.

187
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,580
Take this.

188
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,780
What is this?

189
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,700
We want cash, okay?

190
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,060
I had a deal with Uncle Long.

191
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,020
He said yes.

192
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,980
You can't back out.

193
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,140
What Uncle Long? Never heard of it.

194
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,220
Cash,

195
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,620
understand?

196
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,020
Hurry up.

197
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,420
Give me the money,

198
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,260
or I'll cut off your arm.

199
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
It's up to you.

200
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,500
(Dian Lao'er's Living Room)

201
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,820
Where do you think you're?

202
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,820
Where do you think you're?

203
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,700
Let's go!

204
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,820
We finished work early.

205
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,460
You're always talking about crayfish.

206
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,700
We can have some today.

207
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,020
Let's take your car.

208
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,860
Okay.

209
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,620
Xuan.

210
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,860
Come here.

211
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,700
Why are you here?

212
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,940
We're going to...

213
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,060
Tuan Island's project...

214
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,580
Xing Liang, Tuan Island...

215
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,060
Don't you know the situation?

216
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,460
You can't even solve it.

217
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,620
How can you get her into this?

218
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,820
No. It's not

219
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,360
what you think it is, okay?

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,340
None of you have anything
to do with it, okay?

221
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,640
Why don't we talk about it at home?

222
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,580
Can you stay out of this?

223
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,540
Get in the car, okay?

224
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,820
Well, we'll have a meal next time.

225
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,300
What's wrong with you?

226
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,820
You're so angry.

227
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,460
Just turn the wheel, okay?

228
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,900
Watch the road.

229
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,940
Hello.

230
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
Bao,

231
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,940
did Xing Liang talk to you?

232
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,140
Yes.

233
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,380
I was going to eat crayfish
with your sister,

234
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,600
but...

235
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,580
but Xing Liang

236
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,180
took her away.

237
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,500
Yes.

238
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,860
Listen, that person

239
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,540
is just like that, understand?

240
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,940
(Bin)
Bao?

241
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,660
Bao!

242
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,540
- Stop!
- Stop!

243
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,380
Stop!

244
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,860
Bao!

245
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,540
Bao!

246
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,940
Call an ambulance!

247
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,940
Okay!

248
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
Don't be nervous.

249
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,660
It's not that easy

250
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,700
to kill me.

251
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,540
Binbin...

252
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,780
Go... Go after him.

253
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,380
Go after him.

254
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,060
How's he doing?

255
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,060
I know medicine. Leave it to me.

256
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,420
What?

257
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
You go first.

258
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,380
I'm coming back.

259
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,820
What happened?

260
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,460
Na Fan told me someone was stabbed

261
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,660
at Banshantang's parking garage.

262
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,420
Sit tight.

263
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,540
Bao.

264
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,460
Police.

265
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,380
Step back, all of you.

266
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,420
The ambulance is coming.

267
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,540
- Step back.
- Bao.

268
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,900
Bao.

269
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,700
Bao Chenyan?

270
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,010
Xuan, step back!

271
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,850
Don't touch him!

272
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,780
Bao Chenyan,

273
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,300
I'm Xing Liang.

274
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,500
What happened?

275
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,460
Who's the witness?

276
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,060
I saw him running that way.

277
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,380
Another guy is chasing him.

278
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Did you see his face?

279
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,620
(Parking Garage Southeast Door)

280
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,820
Attention, he's still here.

281
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,980
He's heading southeast.

282
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm a cop. I'm a cop.

283
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,140
Block all the exits.

284
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,180
Block all the exits.

285
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,340
Roger.

286
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,900
Protect the scene.

287
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,740
Okay.

288
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,700
I'll stay with you.

289
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,780
Hello, command center,

290
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,100
this is Xing Liang.

291
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,660
Set up check posts
to block a green Pajero.

292
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,900
Hai AK9822.

293
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,500
(Garage, Exit)

294
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,180
(Operating)

295
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,420
I'll take this.

296
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,500
Hello.

297
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,780
Boss.

298
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,340
I'm in the hospital.

299
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,260
They're trying to save him.

300
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,220
Okay.

301
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,060
I'll keep you informed.

302
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,340
Did they catch him?

303
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,060
No.

304
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,260
Did you see his face?

305
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,020
He was wearing a mask.

306
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,220
I only saw his eyes.

307
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,860
Okay.

308
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,220
When Bao Chenyan gets out,

309
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,700
I'll ask him.

310
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,380
Stop waiting.

311
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,660
I know who did this.

312
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,300
Stop looking.

313
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,020
Everyone knows

314
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,180
it was Dian Lao'er.

315
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,080
Can't you figure it out?

316
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,940
Are you playing dumb?

317
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,100
Who's playing dumb?

318
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,660
Do you have evidence?

319
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,100
You want evidence, right?

320
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,940
Listen, Yellow Hair,

321
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,860
don't make trouble,

322
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,420
or you'll go to jail.

323
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,980
Do you think I'm scared?

324
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,260
Listen,

325
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,300
even if I die,

326
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,580
I'll take revenge for Bao!

327
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,900
- Stop.
- Don't touch me.

328
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,860
Last warning. Don't touch me.

329
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,660
- Don't touch me!
- Luo.

330
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,580
Bao is still in the emergency room.

331
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,100
If you really care

332
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,980
about him,

333
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,620
you shouldn't make trouble

334
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,060
at this point.

335
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,340
Tu Manjiang,

336
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,660
who the hell are you?

337
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,660
Listen, it's none of your business.

338
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,500
Luo Tianyi!

339
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,740
Are you an idiot?

340
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,420
Dian Lao'er can't even protect himself.

341
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,180
How can he deal with Bao?

342
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,500
If you want to die,

343
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,180
I won't stop you,

344
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,700
but please don't

345
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,140
get Bao in trouble.

346
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,860
I won't get him in trouble.

347
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,020
If anything happens,
I'll be responsible.

348
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,580
I will find out whether

349
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,660
Dian Lao'er did it.

350
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,140
If you affect

351
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,920
Tuan Island's project,

352
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,180
can you be responsible?

353
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,040
I've told you

354
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,980
I'll be responsible for anything!

355
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,540
Tianyi!

356
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,340
Talk about it after Bao wakes up.

357
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,690
Tao.

358
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
That's it.

359
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,580
(Operating)

360
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,080
Who's his family?

361
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:28,930
I am.

362
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,460
The patient is out of danger.

363
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,380
They could arrest them somewhere else.

364
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,820
Why did they come here?

365
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,020
Look at

366
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
and antiques.

367
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,980
I'm so unlucky.

368
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,460
Didn't you buy them online?

369
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
They're cheap, right?

370
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,340
Shut up.

371
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,540
I paid for them, okay?

372
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,120
- Lao'er!
- Look at you.

373
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,340
Lao'er!

374
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,900
Lao'er, something happened!

375
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,060
It's serious!

376
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,300
- It's...
- Wait. Wait a minute.

377
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,700
Why can't you

378
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,700
just give me a break?

379
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,980
Lao'er,

380
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,660
it's good news.

381
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,980
Great news!

382
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,100
What?

383
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,300
Bao

384
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,500
was stabbed.

385
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,550
Who?

386
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,450
Bao

387
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,420
was stabbed twice.

388
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,140
He's in the hospital.

389
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,340
Since

390
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,140
Bao came to

391
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,700
Binjiang,

392
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,300
I've been having a hard time.

393
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,420
- Great!
- Great.

394
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,140
He's bullied others

395
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,460
for so many years.

396
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,500
Now he's finally paid the price.

397
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,340
Now,

398
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,500
everyone is wondering who did it.

399
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,620
His men

400
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,700
are looking for the killer.

401
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,820
We can

402
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,500
enjoy the show.

403
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,660
Go ask around.

404
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,540
Find out what happened.

405
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,460
Lao'er, what's wrong?

406
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,860
Lao'er, didn't you

407
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,860
send the person?

408
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,220
Shut up!

409
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,820
Just go!

410
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,970
Okay, I'll go.

411
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,820
You too.

412
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,020
Okay.

413
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,420
It can't be good.

414
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,700
Officers,

415
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,620
they owe money, and they should pay,

416
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,620
right?

417
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,260
Why did you arrest the collector

418
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,780
instead of the debtor?

419
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,220
I can't accept it!

420
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,300
Don't you know

421
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,340
why you're arrested?

422
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,970
I...

423
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,960
I don't know.

424
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,540
Want to play dirty?

425
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
What?

426
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,740
Play dirty?

427
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,340
I don't understand.

428
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,100
Open your eyes and watch.

429
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,300
How many lives are in this bag?

430
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,980
Stop talking, okay?

431
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,100
You carried a bag full of bloody weapons.

432
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,540
How dare you ask why?

433
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,050
Tell me the truth.

434
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,660
I'll tell you.

435
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,820
I'll be honest.

436
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,100
I...

437
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,420
am

438
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,420
a killer.

439
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,380
Tell us more.

440
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,100
Don't get me wrong.

441
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,520
I didn't

442
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,020
kill people.

443
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,140
Hello, go ahead.

444
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,240
We've got the report.

445
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,280
It's

446
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,260
chicken blood.

447
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,260
Chicken blood.

448
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,900
Braised chicken.

449
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,920
It's in my stomach.

450
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,980
If you want to

451
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,380
find the body,

452
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,700
you'll have to

453
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,060
search the toilet

454
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,900
and do

455
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,140
a DNA test, right?

456
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,500
Mr. Xing.

457
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,820
Did you see that?

458
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,500
Why didn't the lab

459
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,100
send us the report earlier?

460
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,180
The Sun Family

461
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,780
has lost Sun Changhai,

462
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,700
and they know

463
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,140
the police are watching them.

464
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,420
They wouldn't turn themselves in.

465
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,780
They just wanted the money.

466
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,860
Got it.

467
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,140
(Dian 12345 Long)

468
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,500
Hello.

469
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,900
Uncle Long.

470
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,700
Did you send

471
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,340
someone to stab Bao?

472
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,540
Why are you so nervous?

473
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,540
It's good for you.

474
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,780
You shouldn't know too much.

475
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,060
The Suns

476
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
were arrested.

477
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,180
Don't worry.

478
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,020
At least three days.

479
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,460
I've

480
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,300
finished the show.

481
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,900
Can you tell him

482
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,940
to give me

483
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,660
the money?

484
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,940
Call him in three days.

485
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,300
Okay, that's it.

486
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,940
If nothing important,

487
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,820
don't call me.

488
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,620
Hello?

489
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,900
How did it go?

490
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,460
The surgery was successful,

491
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,500
but we don't know when he can wake up.

492
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,540
Sister,

493
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
where were you?

494
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,140
I just took a call.

495
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,540
The project is inviting bids,

496
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,900
and it's almost over,

497
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,220
but there's a lot to deal with.

498
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,060
I...

499
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,020
I just joined this project,

500
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,740
and I'm not familiar with it.

501
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,340
Man,

502
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,820
you've participated in

503
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,900
the entire bidding process.

504
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,260
I can only count on you.

505
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,780
Ms. Wen.

506
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,780
The project is Bao's dream.

507
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,700
Don't worry.

508
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,900
I'll try my best.

509
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,940
(Camera, Parking Garage Zone B)

510
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,100
Come in.

511
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,620
Mr. Xing,

512
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,780
we checked the suspect's car.

513
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,700
The owner is in another city.

514
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,940
He didn't know it was stolen.

515
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,860
We checked the surveillance,

516
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,660
but we didn't find anything useful.

517
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,870
Come on.

518
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,260
It's the killer's car.

519
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,980
(Camera, Parking Garage Zone B)
He

520
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,180
must've planned this.

521
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,300
He knew every corner

522
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,140
of the garage well.

523
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,540
Look.

524
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,860
It's Bao Chenyan's car.

525
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,060
After confirming

526
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,540
the location of Bao Chenyan's car,

527
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,380
he hid himself.

528
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,460
Why did he do it at Banshantang?

529
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,100
Bao Chenyan goes to
Tuan Island and Birkin Paris

530
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,260
more frequently than Banshantang.

531
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
Well..

532
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,540
What did Fei Zai say?

533
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,860
Bao Chenyan is out of danger.

534
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,580
We can ask him when he wakes up.

535
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,580
I hope

536
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,380
he can give us some information.

537
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,640
Look,

538
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,160
the killer

539
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,300
is experienced

540
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,740
and cautious.

541
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,460
He's professional.

542
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,420
Another professional killer.

543
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,420
Sun Changhai hired Sun Changhai before.

544
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,500
Maybe he hired this one too.

545
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,700
Bao Chenyan is wounded,

546
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,220
and the main beneficiary

547
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,460
is Dian Lao'er.

548
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,900
(Chen Mingyuan, Lao'er,
Long, Sun Changhai)

549
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,930
Dian Lao'er

550
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,520
must be hiding something from us.

551
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,300
(Upper First-class Hospital,
Outpatient and Emergency)

552
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:01,300
(Outpatient and Emergency)

553
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm here. Don't worry.

554
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,420
Tuan Island's project

555
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,540
can't go wrong.

556
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,460
Please.

557
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,700
I know.

558
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Tao, don't worry.

559
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,620
I won't let Bao down.

560
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,060
I don't understand.

561
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,860
Why don't you like

562
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,620
Uncle Man?

563
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,140
He funded your orphanage.

564
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,580
Shouldn't you

565
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,860
like him?

566
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,400
No one asked him to do it.

567
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,380
You're way out of line.

568
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,740
He's so pretentious.

569
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,060
I just can't stand it.

570
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,780
Only you believe in his good persona.

571
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,700
Why are you always blaming me

572
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,140
for his fault?

573
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,340
You're blinded.

574
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,900
Maybe Uncle Man is pretentious,

575
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,180
but so does every educated man.

576
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,220
Have you gone too far?

577
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,500
You don't understand.

578
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,980
Listen, he's so cunning.

579
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,380
Bao Chenyan's family.

580
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,780
Change the room.

581
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,460
Tao.

582
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,580
I'm blessed

583
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,940
by Lord Guan.

584
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,780
I'm a

585
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,020
lucky man.

586
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,540
I will survive.

587
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,500
I know you're tough

588
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,100
and bulletproof.

589
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,900
I shouldn't have worried.

590
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,860
Exactly.

591
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,300
Bao Chenyan.

592
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,820
I've stayed with you for many years.

593
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,740
I don't want anything.

594
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,180
I don't need a name.

595
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,700
You know that.

596
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,360
You...

597
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,820
What do you want?

598
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,180
I want you to outlive me.

599
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,100
Listen carefully,

600
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,620
I want you to be safe

601
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,700
and die of old age.

602
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,740
It was just a stab.

603
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,500
Why are you

604
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,340
cursing me?

605
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
You're inhuman!

606
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,900
I..

607
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,940
I'm a god.

608
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,100
I understand.

609
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,100
Don't worry.

610
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,700
I'm Fine.

611
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,300
(Deputy General Manager)

612
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,340
- Bin.
- Uncle Man.

613
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,180
Why are you here?

614
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,940
You have a lot of work,

615
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,900
and I have a lot of time.

616
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,100
So, I'm here to see

617
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,420
if there's anything I can do.

618
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,580
What about the hospital?

619
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,200
Tao and Tianyi are there.

620
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,050
He'll be fine.

621
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:49,940
Uncle Man,

622
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,610
do you think I'm stupid

623
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,980
and will slow you down?

624
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,260
How's that possible?

625
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,220
I'm so glad you're here to help me.

626
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,140
To be honest,

627
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,940
I'm almost reaching my limit.

628
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,820
My sister's connections

629
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,900
asked about it.

630
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,180
With our ability,

631
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,260
we're very likely

632
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,420
to win.

633
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,860
It was.

634
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,260
However,

635
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,260
look.

636
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,980
(Information of Shareholders)

637
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,180
Dian Lao'er has a funder now?

638
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,260
We can deal with Dian Lao'er alone,

639
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,780
but now...

640
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,300
It's hard to tell.

641
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,340
Can you find out who it is?

642
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,100
I hope we can figure it out.

643
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,020
At least we'll know what he's got.

644
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,380
But the enemy is hiding in the dark,

645
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,220
and Bao is wounded at this point.

646
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,380
Now I really don't know
what will happen.

647
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,340
Look,

648
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,260
if anything goes wrong,

649
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,210
what am I supposed to tell Bao?

650
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,020
Hello.

651
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,420
We're the police.

652
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,140
Bao Chenyan needs to

653
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,220
make a statement.

654
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,420
He just woke up

655
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,580
and is still weak.

656
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Please leave.

657
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,170
The doctor said

658
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,940
he can answer questions now.

659
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,020
Do you know the consequence

660
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,260
of obstruction?

661
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,380
What are you talking about?

662
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,220
Tao.

663
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,270
Come in.

664
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,940
(VIP Ward)

665
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
How are you?

666
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,620
You brought someone else.

667
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,060
It's obvious

668
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,820
you don't care about my health.

669
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,780
Just make it

670
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,980
clear.

671
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,860
Did you see the attacker's

672
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,700
face clearly?

673
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,140
I

674
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,700
didn't.

675
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,700
You were face to face.

676
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,140
It's less than 15 centimeters.

677
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,660
You didn't see it clearly?

678
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,860
I said

679
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,940
I didn't see it clearly.

680
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,020
Maybe you didn't.

681
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,620
At least you can

682
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,740
describe him.

683
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,300
Don't remember.

684
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,180
You don't remember

685
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,820
or don't want to cooperate?

686
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,180
I don't want to

687
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,700
cooperate with you.

688
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,180
Enough. Liu Yong,

689
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,980
wait outside.

690
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,380
Bao Chenyan,

691
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,940
before the attack at Banshantang,

692
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,420
you were with Xuan.

693
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,500
Do you really think

694
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,420
he was after you?

695
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,180
Okay.

696
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,620
Rest well.

697
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,340
See you next time.

698
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,220
Goodbye.

699
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,940
Sorry to bother you.

700
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,580
Is everything good?

701
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,860
Binbin...

702
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Ask Binbin

703
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,060
over.

704
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,500
Now!

705
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,180
Bro.

706
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,540
I'm here.

707
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,460
I'm coming.

708
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,620
Go upstairs.

709
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,900
Okay.

710
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,180
I'll be waiting for you.

711
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,540
Okay.

712
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,180
Hello.

713
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,180
Mr. Chen.

714
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,780
Mr. Xing?

715
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,020
Why are you calling me?

716
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,300
I'm so flattered.

717
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,820
Where are you?

718
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,300
Well, I miss you.

719
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,560
I...

720
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,300
Where can I be?

721
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,860
Well,

722
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,020
do you want to talk to me?

723
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,900
Of course.

724
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,660
We have a lot to talk about.

725
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,020
The Sun Family,

726
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,940
the money,

727
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,780
and the gun.

728
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,780
We need to talk,

729
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,140
right?

730
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,020
Sir,

731
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
I've told you

732
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,580
everything I know.

733
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,700
You can't get anything...

734
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,580
Oh, no.

735
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,820
There's nothing new.

736
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,020
Don't waste your time.

737
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,300
Dian Lao'er,

738
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,820
it's my job to get

739
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,300
information.

740
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,820
Why do you care?

741
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,820
I've done a lot.

742
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,980
I've been cooperative.

743
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,460
Please don't make it hard for me.

744
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,060
Fine. I know you're busy.

745
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,460
It doesn't matter.

746
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,340
If I can't

747
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
see you

748
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,060
by 4:00 p.m.,

749
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,380
our people

750
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
will take turns

751
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,020
to visit you.

752
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,660
So arrogant.

753
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,380
Who the hell are you?

755
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,460
you were only a loser.
