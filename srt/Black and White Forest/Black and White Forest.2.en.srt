(Two Months Ago)

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
(I'm so useless.)

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,760
(I shouldn't be a cop, right?)

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,160
(How could I lose my gun?)

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,480
(Dad...)

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,560
(I'm so sorry.)

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,400
(Sister,)

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,320
(what should I do?)

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,560
Stop!

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
You...

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,000
Look at you!

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
You lost your gun.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,720
Just take it back!

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,320
It's different.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,240
There's no turning back.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,200
Do you remember

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,600
what your father said

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,320
before he died?

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
He told you to be a cop.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,840
He told me

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,080
to change

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
and be a good man.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,680
I need to defend

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,800
Tuan Island Market.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,160
It's the root of the Wen Family.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,920
Do you think

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,320
it's easy for me?

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,240
Look what has happened.

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,000
What should I do?

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,600
How about this?

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,880
Go to the Tuan Island Market

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
and the company.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,000
There are many people

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,640
with a lot of information.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,240
It can help you find the gun.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,600
He's still a cop even if he's suspended.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,720
He can't give up his aspirations.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,840
We can use this opportunity.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,280
I think Bin should go to
Bao Chenyan's company.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,120
He can go to the grassroots

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,680
and help us find the gun quickly.

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,240
But we need to tell him

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,960
to be careful with the means

44
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,400
he uses to find the gun

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,850
in Bao Chenyan's company.

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,000
He can't investigate it
as a police officer.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
We can't waste his talent.

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,300
=Black&White Forest=

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,260
=Episode 2=

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Speaking of the gunshot,

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have this feeling

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
it was a goodbye gift for me.

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
A gunshot

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
is a big deal.

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,520
If we can't solve this case,

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,080
we'll both be fired.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,240
That's...

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,440
The ballistics report.

59
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Let me see it.

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,640
It's Binbin's police gun.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
Police gun.

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
Liang,

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,520
I only have one question.

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
Can you solve it

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,040
in ten days?

66
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,140
(Emergency Medical Center)

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
You were lucky.

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
It was

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,560
not deadly.

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
Just a scratch,

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
not a big deal.

72
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
Bro...

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,440
I owe you

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,360
my life.

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm your brother.

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,400
My life is yours.

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,960
What's wrong with you?

78
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,100
(Tu Manjiang)
We're brothers.

79
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,880
(Deputy GM of Tuan Island Trading)
No one owes anything.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
It's so cheesy.

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
Come on.

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,280
Bao.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,040
The Tuan Island project

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,840
is at a critical time.

85
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
I know the gunshot

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
is not a good thing,

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,960
but...

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,760
please don't

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,480
do anything rash.

90
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,360
This project is so important to

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
our transformation.

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
My brother is lying here!

94
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
What am I supposed to do?

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Enough!

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,200
I know myself.

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,800
Besides,

98
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,320
we have

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,160
some

100
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,760
money issues.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,000
I think we can consider
some financial programs.

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,600
I've told you before

103
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,720
proper capital injections

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
can not only solve

105
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
our financial problem

106
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,280
but help our old clients
who are short of money

107
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,720
to go through

108
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,440
the hard times.

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
It's a win-win situation.

110
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
Man.

111
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Are you done?

112
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
He was shot! He's lying here!

113
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
Can't you stop talking?

114
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
Talk about it later.

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,520
Okay, I know

116
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,840
you don't like to hear this.

117
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,880
Xing,

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,200
look,

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
I've been here for over a year.

120
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,160
Have I been supportive

121
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,520
- of your work?
- Yes.

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,320
- But ten days...
- Besides,

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,640
I helped you

124
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,680
pursue Xuan, didn't I?

125
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,080
It's our marriage.

126
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,400
What's that got to do with you?

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
Listen,

128
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,280
back then,

129
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,200
Xuan came to our school

130
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,880
to watch the race...

131
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,960
Xuan came to see me every year,

132
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,920
- Yes.
- okay?

133
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,280
That was a relay race with

134
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
the management class.

135
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes.

136
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,160
If I hadn't

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,160
twisted my ankle

138
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,560
and widened the gap between us,

139
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
how could you have

140
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,960
impressed everyone

141
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,720
on the home stretch?

142
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,560
How could Xuan have
rushed into your arms

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,760
and officially become

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,520
your girlfriend?

145
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,680
Therefore, no matter what,

146
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,200
I did you a big favor, right?

147
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,280
Can you do me a favor too?

148
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Solve it

149
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,920
in ten days.

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,840
Can you do that?

151
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
It was a gunshot.

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,800
A police gun.

153
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
If we can't solve it,

154
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,640
we'll be doomed.

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,000
Most importantly,

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,080
the police gun will force

157
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
the procuratorate to step in,

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,400
and Xuan is so anxious about it.

159
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,040
Do you think your life will be easy?

160
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,320
So, we have to get it over with,

161
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
right?

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Crisis is opportunity.

163
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,000
If we do a good job,

164
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,960
awards and promotions will be

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
secondary.

166
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,200
Think about Bin.

167
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,760
Bin will

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
definitely come back

169
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,760
to the team.

170
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,600
Think about it.

171
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,560
But ten days are not enough.

172
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,240
Half a month.

173
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,560
I'll give you half a month.

174
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,080
Is it enough?

175
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,970
Fine.

176
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Half a month, okay?

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,200
Bao,

178
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
did you find Wu?

179
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,440
No clue.

180
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,080
Send everyone

181
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,960
out now.

182
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,480
Find him

183
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
in 24 hours!

184
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Bao, we can't do it.

185
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
You can't be alone.

186
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,640
Dian Lao'er is so vicious.

187
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,760
The killer failed yesterday.

188
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,990
He'll play dirty

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
again.

190
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
Don't worry about me!

191
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,040
Did Dian Lao'er

192
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,520
send the shooter?

193
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
Do you have evidence?

194
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Are you a cop?

195
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
What evidence?

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,440
Who else in Binjiang wants

197
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,320
to kill Bao

198
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
except for Dian Lao'er?

199
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,760
No one.

200
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
Besides,

201
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,440
he played so many dirty tricks

202
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
to take over Tuan Island.

203
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,240
Who else could it be?

204
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,240
I agree. Dian Lao'er

205
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
is cunning,

206
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,080
but I don't think he would dare

207
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,720
to hire a killer.

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
He'd kill you on the street,

209
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,440
not to mention hire a killer.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
It's all your assumption.

211
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,040
It's not a conclusion.

212
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
Fine. Then tell me,

213
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,160
who did it?

214
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
How should I know?

215
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,800
See? You don't know!

216
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,240
Dian Lao'er must've done it!

217
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,400
Bao, just tell me,

218
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,240
shall we kill him?

219
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,280
Don't think about killing him.

220
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,440
It's a critical point for the bidding.

221
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
Bao.

222
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,240
We can't make it worse.

223
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,120
Don't you understand?

224
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,400
For someone like Dian Lao'er,

225
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
you can only

226
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
resort to violence, okay?

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We have no choice!

228
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,080
The police have found out.

229
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,880
We don't need to do it.

230
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,320
They'll figure it out!

231
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
Enough!

232
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Can't you just give me a break?

233
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,720
Let's leave it

234
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
that way.

235
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,800
Right now,

236
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
I'm a completely honest

237
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
businessman,

238
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
right?

239
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
However,

240
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,960
he tried to kill me.

241
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,480
How can I ignore it?

242
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,120
This man...

243
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm going to

244
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,600
teach him the rules.

245
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,560
I want him to know

246
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,880
what he can do

247
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,840
and what he can't

248
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
do!

249
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,400
Bao, we've come so far.

250
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,120
You can't give up everything

251
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,560
out of anger.

252
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Man,

253
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,100
it's not your concern.

254
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,280
Stay out of it.

255
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,520
Captain, we checked

256
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,960
the surveillance in Birkin Paris

257
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
and Baisha Village.

258
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,720
No suspicious vehicles were spotted.

259
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,880
The shooter went to Birkin Paris

260
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,010
from Baisha Village in 30 minutes.

261
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,100
He must've

262
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,400
taken a car

263
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,310
or a motorcycle.

264
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,800
The cameras didn't record it.

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,240
What about nearby drive recorders?

266
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,280
Boss, Boss.

267
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,680
Did you find it?

268
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,640
I tried

269
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,530
but haven't found it.

270
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,370
Hey!

271
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,080
But I found a truck in the neighborhood.

272
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,140
I called the owner,

273
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,820
but he didn't answer it.

274
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
Keep digging.

275
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,560
Don't miss any clues.

276
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,360
It's been so long.

277
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,520
Go.

278
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,880
I've bought coffee for everyone.

279
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,080
Latte, Americano...

280
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Keep looking.

281
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,680
Fei Zai,

282
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,800
here's your cappuccino.

283
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
Good.

284
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
Binbin was worried about us

285
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,160
and bought some coffee.

286
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Yong.

287
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,240
You didn't sleep well.

288
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,320
Come on, have some coffee.

289
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,720
Just go.

290
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
Hurry up. Go.

291
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
The coffee

292
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,640
won't delay your work.

293
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Wait, Boss.

294
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
I think he has a clue.

295
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
Right, Binbin?

296
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Got a clue?

297
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,960
Hai A73011

298
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,000
is his license plate.

299
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,800
Here's the footage
of the drive recorder.

300
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,320
Caviar.

301
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,120
Don't be so petty.

302
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,600
Not even a thank you.

303
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,150
Well, do you want credit?

304
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,800
Why didn't you tell us?

305
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,950
Do you enjoy watching us

306
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,940
get anxious?

307
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm giving you information for free.

308
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,040
Am I wrong?

309
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,960
Wen Binbin,

310
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,280
is that what you expect

311
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,240
of yourself?

312
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,240
Have you learned nothing?

313
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,520
I know you think I'm a loser,

314
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
but this loser

315
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,360
can find a clue faster.

316
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
You're even worse than a loser.

317
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,280
Wen Binbin!

318
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,520
What are you doing?

319
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,320
Did you watch

320
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,640
the footage?

321
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
See?

322
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
I got a clue,

323
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,960
and Mr. Xing knows it.

324
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,410
If you hadn't lost your gun,

325
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,280
none of this would've happened!

326
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,080
I watched it.

327
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,320
It matches the description
of the shooter.

328
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
The procuratorate is coming.

329
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,720
Get ready.

330
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,840
Go to the meeting room.

331
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,480
Xing Liang.

332
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,320
Listen,

333
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,720
I'm responsible

334
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,680
for losing the gun,

335
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,920
so it's my duty

336
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,350
to help you solve the case.

337
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,130
Why are you following me?

338
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,360
We're having an internal case meeting.

339
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,280
You should go that way.

340
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
Mr. Xing,

341
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,640
are we being too hard on Bin?

342
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,720
No matter what,

343
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,440
Bin did a good job today.

344
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,420
If it wasn't for the drive recorder,

345
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,400
we'd waste so much time.

346
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,360
When we find the evidence,

347
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,880
it'd be too late.

348
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,360
That's right.

349
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,880
Bin worked hard

350
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
and gave us information.

351
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,200
We can't do this to him.

352
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,280
It's like the farmer and the snake.

353
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,120
Enough.

354
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,120
You're talking too much.

355
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,240
Come on.

356
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,200
Let's have a meeting.

357
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,840
Someone heard a scream
from the boat right there.

358
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,240
It was the Shanxi dialect.

359
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,520
Wu is very likely to be here,

360
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,080
but we don't know which boat he's on.

361
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,800
Over there?

362
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,680
Yes.

363
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,920
You two,

364
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
stay here.

365
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,800
Call us if anyone comes.

366
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,560
- Okay.
- The rest of you, come with me.

367
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
What are you doing here?

368
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
Sir, we're looking for someone.

369
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,320
Who?

370
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,640
Look.

371
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,760
That's him.

372
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,120
Have you seen him?

373
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,160
No.

374
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
Haven't seen him.

375
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,920
Really?

376
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,520
Enough. Don't make trouble.

377
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,000
There are things on the boat.

378
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What if they're lost?

379
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,920
Just go.

380
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
We're not making trouble.

381
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,040
He's my brother.

382
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,200
I have to find him.

383
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,400
Sir,

384
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,160
I'll be responsible for any loss.

385
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,320
Please move, okay?

386
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,080
You have no choice.

387
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,160
Come on!

388
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,760
What about you?

389
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
We'll stay.

390
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,090
Okay.

391
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,560
- Hello.
- Gui,

392
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,680
a group of people came to the pier

393
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
to look for someone.

394
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,760
I saw the picture.

395
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,440
It's the person you brought here
the other day.

396
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
Stop them, okay?

397
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,480
I can't. They have many people.

398
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,680
Stop them.

399
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,520
I'm coming.

400
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,840
They can't take him away!

401
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
Search!

402
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,480
Check the cabins.

403
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,240
Wu!

404
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,480
Wu!

405
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,640
Wu!

406
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Er'leng...

407
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,080
Er'leng...

408
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,960
Er'leng...

409
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,240
Go!

410
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,560
Wu!

411
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Wu!

412
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,000
Behave yourself,

413
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,880
or I'll beat you.

414
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,080
Wu!

415
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
Wu!

416
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,600
Wu!

417
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
Wu!

418
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,110
Wu!

419
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,040
Wu!

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Wu!

421
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,600
Wu!

422
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,440
Who the hell are you?

423
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,360
How dare you make a scene?

424
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,920
Get the hell out!

425
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
Everyone, stop!

426
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,840
What the hell?

427
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,440
How dare you do this

428
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,560
in public?

429
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,120
Stop looking. Come over.

430
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,720
I was wondering who it was.

431
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,680
It's you.

432
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,400
Listen,

433
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,680
it's not

434
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
your boss Bao's territory,

435
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,680
understand?

436
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,760
Listen,

437
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,800
I know Wu is here.

438
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,320
Let him go,

439
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
and you'll be fine.

440
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,120
If not,

441
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,920
let's wait and see.

442
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,040
How do you know he's here?

443
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,120
Watch your language.

444
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
I'll break your teeth,

445
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,000
okay?

446
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Come on.

447
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,040
Come on.

448
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,640
What?

449
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,400
I'll chop you up and feed the fish!

450
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,040
Then try me!

451
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,640
Listen,

452
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,920
I'm not in the mood.

453
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,440
Don't make trouble.

454
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,680
Get the hell out.

455
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm also in a bad mood.

456
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,240
Release him,

457
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,880
or I'll beat the hell out of you.

458
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,320
Boss,

459
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,400
they have more people.

460
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
We should retreat.

461
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,040
How dare you say that?

462
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I told you to keep watch.

463
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Why didn't you call me?

464
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
Why didn't you run?

465
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,560
Go to the hospital.

466
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,880
Let's forget about it

467
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,120
for now.

468
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,560
I'll come back.

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,840
Let's go.

470
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,400
Wait...

471
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,640
Why did you let them go?

472
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,320
What if they called the police?

473
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,920
The police might be here.

474
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,080
We've got the person.

475
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,680
What if something happens?

476
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,880
Don't worry.

477
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,760
They'll pay for this.

478
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,640
What's wrong?

479
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,240
What's the rush?

480
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,920
Someone's making trouble.

481
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,400
Who?

482
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,400
Tell me his name.

483
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,240
I'll take care of it.

484
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
I'm talking about you.

485
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,160
What? Me?

486
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
What did I do?

487
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,240
You're at least

488
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,480
a 40-year-old adult.

489
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,200
Don't get pissed off at anything

490
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,120
like a child.

491
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
I thought I was overthinking it.

492
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,240
Look at you.

493
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
What can I say?

494
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,000
Can you not let me get it right

495
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
for just once?

496
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,080
Do you want to go to

497
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,920
ICU or detention center this time?

498
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,320
Can you give me a break?

499
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,240
Wait. Dian Lao'er kidnapped my brother.

500
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,680
How can I ignore it?

501
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,200
What did my father

502
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,360
tell you before he died?

503
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,200
What did you promise?

504
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,520
I remember everything.

505
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,760
He told me

506
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,800
to be a good man

507
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,040
and do good business.

508
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,400
Listen,

509
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,000
I paid a lot of money

510
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,360
for a stylist.

511
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,520
Look at

512
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,400
my hairstyle

513
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,600
and the suit.

514
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,200
Zixuan,

515
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,040
I look like

516
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,080
a real businessman from head to toe.

517
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,160
Then do real business.

518
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,280
I understand.

519
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,560
You had to use extreme measures

520
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,960
to gain a foothold in Binjiang.

521
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,920
However, now that
you've decided to change,

522
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,560
you can't use those measures anymore.

523
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,800
The gunshot last night

524
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,040
is a big deal.
The police will deal with it.

525
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,880
Don't do anything unnecessary.

526
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,840
Fine. You're right.

527
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,840
If Dian Lao'er

528
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,920
behaves himself,

529
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,120
I won't do anything.

530
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,320
Actually, I also want to know

531
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,160
what Xing...

532
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,000
what the police

533
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
are capable of.

534
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
Do you think I'm annoying

535
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,000
because I'm meddling in your business?

536
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,840
Yes.

537
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,640
How's that possible?

538
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,440
How's that possible?

539
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,440
Then why did you give me that look?

540
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,400
I'm worried about Binbin.

541
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,000
Do you know

542
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,000
I regret it now?

543
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,160
I don't know

544
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
if he should work for me.

545
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,320
He was there

546
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,200
when the gun went off.

547
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,320
What if...?

548
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,600
Binbin is fine.

549
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,720
Besides,

550
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,120
since he was suspended,

551
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,160
you've been there for him

552
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,240
and talked to him.

553
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,840
You cheered him up.

554
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,280
I should thank you.

555
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

556
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,800
But I've always felt

557
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,880
my dad treated you better than Binbin.

558
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,400
I know.

559
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
What do you want?

560
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I saw your car from afar.

561
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
What are you whispering about?

562
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,560
It's not your business.

563
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
Yes.

564
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,920
Goodbye.

565
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,800
Fine.

566
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,080
No one likes me.

567
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm leaving.

568
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,960
Look, he's angry.

569
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
Binbin,

570
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,240
we're just kidding.

571
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
What's wrong?

572
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Why are you so upset?

573
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,640
Who bullied you?

574
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
Do you know Xing Liang
kicked down the ladder?

575
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,680
You were right.

576
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,640
He's a selfish hypocrite.

577
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,720
- Yes!
- How can you say that?

578
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,120
Take that back.

579
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,080
Did you make a mistake

580
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,000
and feel guilty?

581
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,640
What's wrong with you?

582
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,200
What did I do?

583
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,920
Your good husband

584
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,760
screwed me over

585
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,600
You deserve it.

586
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,360
I tried so hard

587
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,080
to get the clue.

588
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
They didn't

589
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,800
even thank me.

590
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,000
This is too much.

591
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,840
They can't count on me anymore.

592
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,560
I won't play with them.

593
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,400
I'll do it myself.

594
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
Look at you.

595
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm warning you.

596
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,360
Don't make trouble.

597
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,320
Don't make it worse.

598
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,360
Sister, I'm not making trouble.

599
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,200
I have no choice.

600
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,560
The procuratorate talked to me.

601
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,800
I don't know if I can be a cop again.

602
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,160
What do you mean?

603
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,120
The gunshot

604
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,520
was caused by my gun.

605
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,080
Is it confirmed?

606
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,560
Please believe me.

607
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
So, sister,

608
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,640
do you think I can ignore this?

609
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,560
Zixuan, he must do something.

610
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,600
The most important thing

611
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
is to try our best

612
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,880
to find the fun.

613
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,920
Only in this way

614
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,800
can Binbin go back to the office.

615
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,760
Yes.

616
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,880
Sister.

617
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
Fine.

618
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,800
You can investigate it.

619
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,320
But I have to tell you,

620
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,360
don't do anything you shouldn't do.

621
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,320
Sister, I know what I'm doing.

622
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,360
Don't worry.

623
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,560
I'll take care of everything.

624
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
As you know,

625
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm a good man.

626
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,640
I won't do bad things.

627
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,920
Stop looking.

628
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,180
(Shooter)

629
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,340
(Murder)

630
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,480
Mr. Xing,

631
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,600
I found something.

632
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,320
Mr. Xing, look.

633
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,340
(Platform Surveillance System)

634
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,680
Dian Lao'er

635
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,440
knows the shooter?

636
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,130
- Big.
- Big.

637
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,080
Drink your wine.

638
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,880
- Drink.
- Drink.

639
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,200
It's four.

640
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,480
Here.

641
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,040
Come on. Go on.

642
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,720
Big.

643
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,560
Who is this? Answer me.

644
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,240
I finished my work.

645
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,480
Give me money.

646
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,040
What are you talking about?

647
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,920
What have you done?

648
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,240
I only told you to pretend it

649
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,320
and scare Bao.

650
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,640
How could you try to kill him?

651
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,480
Believe it or not, Bao would love

652
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,840
to pay me double.

653
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,040
I'll give you the money.

654
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,640
100 thousand yuan.

655
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,240
You were talking too loud

656
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,560
and scared me.

657
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,840
You must pay for moral damages.

658
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,160
300 thousand in total.

659
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,440
Your life is not even

660
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,720
worth that much!

661
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,120
500 thousand.

662
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,640
10:00 p.m. tonight.

663
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,080
I'll tell you the address.

664
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,640
You don't have to come.

665
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
But think twice.

666
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,840
I...

667
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,720
What...

668
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,600
What...

669
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,430
What the hell?

670
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,400
Stop barking,

671
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
or I'll cook you!

672
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,480
Kill and cook you!

673
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,550
Stop! Stop!

674
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,520
Lao'er, what's wrong?

675
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Get ready

676
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,160
for our guest.

677
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,360
Mr. Xing,

678
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
Dian Lao'er just withdrew

679
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,560
500 thousand yuan.

680
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,040
Okay, got it.

681
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,860
(500 thousand yuan)

682
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,360
Let's eat.

683
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,680
Mr. Chen,

684
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,080
what a coincidence.

685
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,800
Bro,

686
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
shall we go out?

687
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,080
Am I bothering you?

688
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,040
No, not at all.

689
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
It smells good.

690
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
The food is good,

691
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,560
but the service is slow.

692
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,760
13:10, Beijing time...

693
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
Mr. Xing,

694
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,480
you can stay and eat.

695
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,640
I'm full. I have to go.

696
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
The meal

697
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,160
is on me.

698
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,040
Shall we talk?

699
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,040
Okay.

700
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,840
Well, I'm not an official.

701
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,760
I don't have time.

702
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,280
I have a lot of work to do.

703
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,200
You can make it clear.

704
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,520
Did you send the shooter

705
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,400
to Birkin Paris?

706
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
Wait, sir.

707
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,800
I know you want to solve the case,

708
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
but you can't frame me.

709
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,080
I've told you many times.

710
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,280
I have

711
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,720
nothing to do with it.

712
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,560
Don't move.

713
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,440
Is there a metal

714
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,080
detector in your eye?

715
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,160
What are you talking about?

716
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,320
You know I've had eye disease

717
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
since I was young.

718
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,400
Oh, no.

719
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,480
Look,

720
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,120
since he entered Birkin Paris Club,

721
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,080
he's been staring at you.

722
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,920
Before the gunshot,

723
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,320
based on the images

724
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,440
of our cameras,

725
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,960
it's obvious

726
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,050
that you were at least

727
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,360
10 meters away from him.

728
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
However, you kept

729
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,990
looking at him.

730
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,560
If there's no metal detector,

731
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,520
you must know each other.

732
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,000
No!

733
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,560
I don't know him at all.

734
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,360
Sir,

735
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,600
please... please believe me.

736
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,600
I have

737
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
poor eyesight.

738
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,400
This must be a misunderstanding.

739
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,000
If you really want to know,

740
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,520
I'll be honest with you.

741
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,960
He looks like

742
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,240
my cousin

743
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,480
who sells

744
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,600
seafood.

745
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,200
Anyway,

746
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,840
if you have evidence,

747
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,280
you can

748
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,760
arrest me.

749
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,080
If not,

750
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,840
you... you can't frame me.

751
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,880
Well,

752
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,240
I have to go.

753
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,720
Fine. Bao is not as busy as you.

754
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,600
You're different.

755
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,960
You're a forgetful busy man.

756
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,360
I'll show him the video,

757
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,800
but I think

758
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,640
you'll

759
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,080
be very busy.

760
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,410
Do businessmen

761
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,120
always carry so much cash?

762
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,320
Oh, I just think

763
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,880
it's not safe to carry so much cash.

764
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,280
But it doesn't matter.

765
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
You're my friend.

766
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll tell my colleague

767
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,200
to protect you.

768
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,560
I...

769
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,320
I was blackmailed.

770
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,400
I need your help.

771
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,100
(Tuan Island Market)

772
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,720
I didn't see him clearly,

773
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,600
but the mole and the necklace

774
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
are correct.

775
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,080
Okay, enough.

776
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,480
It's been so long.

777
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,600
A mole and a necklace!

778
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,240
Tianyi.

779
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,400
Er'leng.

780
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
Did you take a picture?

781
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,880
Yes.

782
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Send the picture

783
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,320
to our brothers.

784
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,520
We'll search through

785
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,610
the entire city

786
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,250
to find this man.

787
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,640
Okay.

788
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,480
Hurry up. Hurry.

789
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,470
- Tianyi.
- Okay.

790
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,120
Look up this car.

791
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Okay, send it to me.

792
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,120
Thanks.

793
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,200
Okay, got it.

794
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,080
Mr. Xing, Fei Zai's team has arrived

795
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,540
and arranged everything.

796
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,520
Tell him the person has a gun.

797
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,360
He's very dangerous.

798
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,040
They must be careful.

799
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,920
Don't let him escape.

800
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,200
We're coming.

801
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,040
Someone spotted him at Changwei Alley.

802
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,120
Already?

803
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,840
Are you sure?

804
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,960
We'll know after

805
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,800
we check it out.

806
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,440
Mr. Xing,

807
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,880
Bin told me

808
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,960
they spotted the suspect.

809
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,120
He's at Changwei Alley.

810
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,720
Changwei Alley?

811
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,640
Yes.

812
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,680
It's nearby, right?

813
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,400
Attention, attention,

814
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
stay alert.

815
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,880
The target will show up anytime.

816
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,960
Roger.

817
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,250
- I'm leaving.
- Go.

818
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,720
Hello.

819
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,680
Dian Lao'er,

820
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,710
if you dare to betray me

821
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,430
and call the police,

822
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,170
I'll kill you.

823
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,800
Oh, no!

824
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,320
No! Hello?

825
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,200
Attention,

826
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
the target has shown up.

827
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,840
Hello.

828
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,040
Have you eaten?

829
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,800
Don't move!

830
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,000
Don't move!

831
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,920
Liu Yong, catch him.

832
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,040
Get him!

833
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Police! Don't move!

834
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,040
- Police! Don't move!
- Police! Don't move!

835
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,880
Don't move!

836
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,960
Catch him!

837
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,080
What's your name?

838
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,760
Li Zhi.

839
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,900
(Missed Call)

840
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,120
Mr. Xing, he's not the suspect.

841
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Block the area.

842
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,910
Interrogate him now.

843
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,640
Block the area, interrogate him now!

844
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
- Hurry.
- Take him!

845
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
- Come on.
- Get up.

846
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,800
Mr. Xing,

847
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,400
he's just a delivery guy.

848
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,920
Someone paid him 200 yuan

849
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,740
to pick up something here.

850
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,280
He doesn't know anything else.

851
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Did he see the face

852
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,000
of the suspect?

853
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,160
He didn't see it clearly
because of the hat,

854
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,120
but the description
of his height and size

855
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,670
matched the shooter.

856
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,880
Mr. Xing.

857
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
It's the shooter.

858
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,120
Hello.

859
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,640
You broke the rule.

860
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,760
You'll pay for it.

861
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,560
I'm warning you.

862
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,720
You can't get away with a crime.

863
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,280
I'll see you again.

864
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,640
Okay.

865
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,860
I'm looking forward to that.

866
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,600
But I need to remind you

867
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,560
the gun was sealed for two months.

868
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,300
Once it goes off,
no one can stop it anymore.

869
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,720
Officer,

870
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,000
you'd better

871
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,520
hurry up.

872
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Look up this number.

873
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,720
