00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,382
So, can I check you?

181
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,300
Give me your side view.

00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,551
Now, front.

Okay. The best for you
would be Linear Firm.

184
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,184
It's a brand new machine
exclusive here at Belo.

185
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,811
It's micro focused ultrasound

186
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,231
so as an effect, it gives
you new collagen

187
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,983
and then lift your face

188
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,735
and make it tighter and
your face a little smaller.

189
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,656
Having more collagen
will make you look like a baby.

190
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,032
And the best thing about it

191
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,743
is that it only takes
30 minutes to do.

192

I want that too.
Doc, can I do that?

193

Of course.
As the mother of the groom,
