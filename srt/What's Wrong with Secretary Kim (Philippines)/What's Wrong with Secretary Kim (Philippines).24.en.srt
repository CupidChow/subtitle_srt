<i> If you get nervous,</i>

357
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,367
<i>just look at the right side
of the stage.</i>

358
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,700
<i>I'll be there
cheering for you.</i>

359
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
<i> Wait, um...</i>

360
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,400
<i>I was hoping
I could talk to you.</i>

361
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,867
<i>I need to
tell you something.</i>

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,967
<i>You were, um,
talking about a girl.</i>

363
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,200
<i> Is she real?</i>

364
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,067
<i>You described her
so vividly.</i>

365
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,567
<i> A girlfriend perhaps?</i>

366
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,867
<i>Was she with you
when you got kidnapped?</i>

367
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,867
