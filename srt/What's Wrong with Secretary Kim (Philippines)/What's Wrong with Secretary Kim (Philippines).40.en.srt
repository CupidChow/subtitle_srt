(BRANDON)
Philip, I feel sorry for Kim.

183
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,495
You know, even if
we have a wedding planner,

184
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,788
she's still having a hard time.

185
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,499
Don't trust your wedding
planner too much, bro.

186
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,543
The wedding planner
we hired before

187
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,212
booked a church
full of electric fans.

188
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,674
And what's wrong with that?
Isn't that a good thing?

189
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,967
No, it's not.

190
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,136
The fans blew out all the
candles during the ceremony.

191
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,221
And that's a very bad omen, bro.

192
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,391
That's probably why
Laura and I separated.

Wrong timing, bro.

his best man, bro.

I'm sorry, Philip.

just trying to sabotage me.

She likes to check things.

Are you okay?
You look worried.

206
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,764
It's Philip's fault for
making me paranoid.

Okay, Philip, you can
be my best man,

the candles in the church

to risk it.

Secretary Kim for nine years.

they still choose
to be together.

Yeah, but that's
a different situation.

Kim is going to Korea
for God knows how long.

is all about, Brandon?

what she said,

(CARLOTA) Oh, yeah.
He has two cowlicks.
