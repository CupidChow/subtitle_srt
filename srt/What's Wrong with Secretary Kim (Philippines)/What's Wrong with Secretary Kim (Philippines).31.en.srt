358
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,247
Mom.

359
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,749
What are you doing here?

361
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,260
Is that for Kim?

362
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,848
Cyrus told me.

363
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,060
So Kim is the one
who's been helping you cope.

364
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,314
We're not doing so well
right now, Mom.

365
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,773
I know.

366
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,567
They're mad at you.

367
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,403
All of them?

368
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,448
- [KAT] That'll do.
- [KLA] Are you sure?

372
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,787
If you don't want to listen
to what I have to say, then...

373
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,331
please help me out.

374
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,458
Let me cook that for her.

375
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,251
Is that Cyrus?

376
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,003
I want to talk to him.

377
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,422
It didn't help my daughter.
He hurt her.

378
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,257
My son is hurt too.

379
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,636
Mr. Liwanag...

380
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,973
my children have suffered a lot.

381
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,641
So, please...

382
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,269
be kind.

383
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,104
Did you lie to me too?

384
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,610
I feel like you both
conspired against me.

385
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,445
It started because of me.

386
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,032
Is that why you pretended
to be Ninja Boy?

387
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,787
So you could protect Brandon?
