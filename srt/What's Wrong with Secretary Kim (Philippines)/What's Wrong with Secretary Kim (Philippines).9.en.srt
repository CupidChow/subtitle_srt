You're so adorable,
but stop bursting my bubble!

[JORDY] Ouch.

361
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,668
That hurt, Miss Sarah.

362
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,294
But it's really sad.

363
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,005
I can't imagine being mad
at my only sibling.

364
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,093
Don't worry about them.
They're billionaires.

365

It does balance things out.

- Hello, dear!
- Mom.

00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,365
I see you're going all out
for this dinner.

370
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,533
Of course!

371
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,285
In fact, I had them prepare

372
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,619
coconut pandan salad
for dessert.

373

Remember? That's yours
and Donny's favorite.

374
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,584
And I want to remind
your brother

00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,962
of the days when things were
simpler and more peaceful.

Unfortunately, Mom, I wasn't
able to convince Brandon

377
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,675
to join us tonight.

378
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,135
Kim will handle that.

between them?

Both he and Secretary Kim

383
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,478
are very professional.

Donny simply
trusts her decisions

386
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,652
because Secretary Kim
does what is best for him.

387
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,947

[KIM] Hi, Sir Morpheus.
First of all, I am a huge fan.

But today, I'm writing to
formally invite you

with your reporter friend?

How could you not
tell me about that?

407
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,779
Why do you even care
about my secretary?

408

Nothing.
