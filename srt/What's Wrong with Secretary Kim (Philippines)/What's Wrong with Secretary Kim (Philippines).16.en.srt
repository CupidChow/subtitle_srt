- Yummy.
- Ahh.

361
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,628
Sorry.

362
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,880
I've been calling
your phone, Steph.

363
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,757
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.

364
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,758
Good afternoon.

365
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,136
Here. You left it
in your cubicle.

366
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,638
Thank you, sir. [GIGGLES]

367
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,975
So, do you plan to attend
the meeting with the Park Group,

368
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,893
or should I take
the minutes myself?

369
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,353
Oh! I'm sorry, sir.

370
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,896
Uh. I forgot that was today.

371
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,939
Yes. [CHUCKLES]

still 10 minutes left.

[WALTER] Wow, Sir Philip.

00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,368

you were so patient.

one mistake per day,

Excuse me. I'll go now.

I think his blood pressure
is shooting up.

00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,846
It seems like it.

00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,474
[BRANDON] Uh... We are
launching this at IdeaEx, right?

389
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,767
Yes, sir.

390
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,853
The tagline is on point,

391
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,022
and the brand's objective
is clear.

392
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,233
But what's the campaign's
connection to IdeaEx?

393
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,695
We actually tied it up with the
characters from Morpheus's book,

394
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,407
who are empowered and ready
to face their problems.

395
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,286
Too contrived, not organic.

What do we know about our
speaker aside from his books?

[RUTH] Um...

398

He's your brother.

00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,923
Right.

00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,217
And my father
started this company.

401
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,973
Think of this as a...
family reunion of sorts.

402
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,560
Powervee is a legacy
brand, as well.

403
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,648
So, family, legacy...

404
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,943
How do we connect this
to our vitamins?

405
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,904
We take vitamins
so we can work for our families.

406
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,155
[BRANDON] Right.

407
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,825
And so we can keep them happy.

408
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,409
Because when you get sick,

409
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,204
it's not just you
who is affected,

410
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,289
but also your loved ones.

411
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,707
When you get sick,

412
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,836
you won't be able to generate
income for your family.

413
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,587
And on top of that,

414
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,882
we sometimes need a family
member to take care of us.

415
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,760
It takes time.
It takes effort.

416

So, Powervee takes care of you

417
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,057

of all the people you love.
