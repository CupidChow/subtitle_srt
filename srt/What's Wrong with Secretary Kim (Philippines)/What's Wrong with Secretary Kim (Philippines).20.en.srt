[SARAH] You know, Sir Walt...

367
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,252
Why are you so paranoid?

368
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,545
I'm not paranoid.

369
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,380
I already gave you
what you wanted.

00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,965
So, please...

00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,049
And so?

You know that people
can be very judgmental.

376
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,058
If they find out
I only have one set of clothes,

377
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,893
it'll stay in their
minds forever.

378
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,189
They'll remember me
as Roni the outfit repeater,

379
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,067
and not as Roni the
very good-looking worker.

380
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,278

will go down the drain.
