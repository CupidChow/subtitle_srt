[UNSETTLING MUSIC PLAYING]

363
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,240
Why did they order
a news blackout?

364
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,783
What are they afraid of?

365
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,660
[TROY] This is pretty common

366
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,537
in kidnapping cases.

367
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,748
The family tries to
keep the media out,

368
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,584
because if news spreads
about them paying the ransom,

369
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,379
others may try to
kidnap one of them again.

370
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:42,050
Ultimately, it's for the safety
and protection of the children.

371
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,177
W-Wait.

372
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,388
If they ordered
the news blackout,

373
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,473
does that mean...

374
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,145
One of their children
got kidnapped with you.

375
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,565
Now, according to
the initial report,

376
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,483
before the news blackout,

377
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,736
the child was in fourth grade
when it happened.

378
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,739
[FELIX] Kim.

379
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,659
You work at Prime Alpha.
Do you know your boss' siblings?

380
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,953
Their eldest was in fourth grade

381
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,622
during the time
of the kidnapping.

382
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,709
My boss was accelerated.

383
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,006
He and Sir Cyrus
entered fourth grade together.

384
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,762
Which one of them is Ninja Boy?

386
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,298
What can I do for you?

387
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:07,177
Please don't think
I'm intruding on Boss's privacy.

388
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,428
You can ask me anything.

389
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,680
Was he kidnapped
when he was a child?

390
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,308
Huh?

391
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,602
I think I'm getting
through to Sec. Kim.

392
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,896
Hm? Really?

393
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,147
Yeah.

394
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,484
I mean, I'm more confident
in telling her how I feel.

395
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,238
And besides, I've already
made her smile a lot of times.
