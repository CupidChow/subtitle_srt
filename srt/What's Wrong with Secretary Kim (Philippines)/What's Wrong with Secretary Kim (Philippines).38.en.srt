00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,865
I'm tired of feeling this way.

538
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,869
I know.

539
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,539
Who would ever want
to feel that way?

540
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,211
You have to go through
the whole process, Brandon.

541
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,630
Eventually,

542
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,924
once your anger fades away,

543
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,842
you'll be able to forgive.

544
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,554
And that void in your heart

545
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,433
will be filled with the love
we have for each other.

You know,

00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,948
that's why I've made
my decision.

549
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,451
I won't leave anymore.

550
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,540
Okay?

551
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,792
No.

552

But, Kim...

553

Y-You can't base
your decisions on me.

00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,515
I'm sure there are still
many opportunities out there.

557
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:55,520
I got into
a master's program here.

558
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,730
I can be of service somehow.

559

Besides, I don't want
to leave Dada here.

560

And I want to support you
in your journey towards healing.

561
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,949
I don't need a babysitter.

562

That's not what I meant.

563
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,497
I just don't want...

you to go through
all this alone.

Kim.

568
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,179
When you filed your resignation,
I tried to stop you

569
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,308
because I was afraid.

570
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,437
I was afraid that...

571
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,440
What if something bad
happens to you,

572
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,026
and I'm not there
to protect you?

573
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,945
It took some time,
and I realized that...

574
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,990
it's selfish of me.

575
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,288
And I don't want
that relationship for us.

And besides,

577
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:00,960
I have to learn how
to face this by myself.

I promise...

I'll be back soon.

Maybe you should promise me
one more thing.

- [GASPS] It's your mom!

a few adjustments,
