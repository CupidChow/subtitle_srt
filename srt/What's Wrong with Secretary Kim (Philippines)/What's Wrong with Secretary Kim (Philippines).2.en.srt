Mm-hmm.

But... But we have...

369
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,065
We have medications for that.

370
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,275
It's expensive, boss.

371
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,943
You have health insurance.

372
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,570
It doesn't cover meds.

373
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,155
What the hell are you talking
about? Of course, it's covered.

374
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,740
We're a pharmaceutical company.

I can even buy you
cranberry juice,

whatever juice you want.

Fruit juices don't
work on me anymore.

We have a clinic downstairs.

That's why I always
spend my days off

380
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,168
having checkups at the clinic.

381
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,670
You have paid leaves.

382
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,548
I can't use them because
of the heavy workload.

Time for myself.
