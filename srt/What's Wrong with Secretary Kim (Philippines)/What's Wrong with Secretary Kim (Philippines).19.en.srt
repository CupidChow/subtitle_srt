00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,990
is it because Cyrus beat you?

364
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,452
Or because you're getting
jealous of him and Sec. Kim?

365
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,245
Cyrus doesn't bother me!

366
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,913
Really?

367
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,207
Yeah, what bothers me is...

368
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,084
the thing that happened
to my cousin.

369
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,003
Oh, he's back?

370
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,590
How is cuz-that-I-don't-know?

371
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,594
Someone's trying to make a move
on the girl he likes.

372
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,596
Is that so?

373
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,099
What are the chances?
You have the same problem!

374
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,019
So will you help him or not?

375
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,564
Okay. [MOUTH CLICKS]

376
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,357
If the girl really means so much

377
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,402
to your cuz-that-I-don't-know,

378
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,780
then he should act quickly.

379
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,200
He should confess his feelings
before he loses her.

380
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,618
As in now!

381
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,871
You know what?
You're right.

382
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,498
[SCOFFS] Of course!

383
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,459
The flirting has to stop.

384
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,627
Uh-huh.

385
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,587
You know,
it's about time that I...

386
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,630
Hmm?

387
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,632
[BRANDON STUTTERS]
That...

388
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,634
That my cousin...

389
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,806
That my cousin asks her out.

390
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,890
Right.

391
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:20,565
["LAGI" BY BINI PLAYING]

392
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:42,546
["LAGI" CONTINUES]

393
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,971
I don't like it.

394
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,305
Sir, how about this one?

395
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,723
- No.
- This?

396
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,975
I hate it!

397
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,394
Cyrus and Sec. Kim
are together now.

398
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,020
I thought you didn't care?

399
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,021
You're jealous.

400
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,107
- What happened?
- It's confidential.

401
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,650
Take care, Ninja Boy.

402
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,069
I want you to bury
your old memories.

403
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,404
Past is past.

404
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,156
But it's important to me.

405
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,783
Important enough to upset
the person you're flirting with?

406
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,660
For God's sake, Secretary Kim,

407
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,705
let's stop flirting
and start dating.
