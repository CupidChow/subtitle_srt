What did you expect?

364
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,490
You resigned, then I found out
you had job offers elsewhere.

365
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,741
I, therefore, concluded that...

Well... yes.

What did you expect, Sec. Kim?

Should I order you
to do that as well?

Okay, Sec. Kim, find out
why you are resigning
