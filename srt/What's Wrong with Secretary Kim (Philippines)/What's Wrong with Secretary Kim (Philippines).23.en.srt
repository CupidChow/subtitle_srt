Hello?

Ma, uh...

00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,210
- We'll go now.
- Okay.

363
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,546
Don't make things difficult
for Secretary Kim, okay?

364
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,174
Please treat her well.

365
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,009
Very, very well.

366
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,387
She's done so much,
not just for Brandon,

367
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,640
but for our family, too.

368
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,558
She deserves to be happy.

- Sir, here you go.
- Okay.

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,671
That was good, Sir Cyrus.

[CYRUS] Really? Thank you.

00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,217
Let me fix your pants.

You don't need to do that.

P-Part of the job, um,

you have to look
picture perfect.

I'm not Brandon.

Uh, for the next scene,
Sir Cyrus,

It's just a bit sunny today.

387
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,949
Oh, I don't mind the heat, sir.

388
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,159
I missed the heat.

Back in Berlin, it gets
to zero degrees sometimes.

- You can take the cold?
- I love the winter.

391
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,582
I don't get cold easily.

392
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,625
Or maybe my skin's
just too thick.

he was trembling.

396

He gets cold easily.
That's why he easily gets sick.

Secretary Kim gave it to Cyrus.

Why would she do that?

401
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:20,310
You know how your brother is.
He's always so secretive.

402
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:24,105
I think he's starting to
fall in love with Secretary Kim.

403
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,566
- Boss BMC.
- Jordy.

Sir Cyrus right now.

How... How close are they
to each other?

409
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,995
You should stop playing with
Secretary Kim's feelings.

So, you like Secretary Kim, too?
