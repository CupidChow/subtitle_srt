[KAT GIGGLES]

365
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,759
[MOUTHING] No.

366
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,844
Um...

367
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,472
Let's just talk later.
My boss is already here.

368
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,390
Oh, alright.

369
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,102
Tell him to stop
being toxic, demanding,

370
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,145
and intrusive!

371
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,689
He thinks he's all that.

372
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,275
He's not even that tall!

373
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,609
And tell him...

374
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,528
Uh, Kat, I have to go.

375
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,489
I'll just call you later.
Bye. Take care.

- Hello? Hello?

377
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,452
You can't date.

378
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,621
Why not?

379
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,707
Because...

380
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,000
Because I said so.

[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

382
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,499
What's up with HR today?

383
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,792
I'd rather answer this survey

384
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,461
than have Roni ask us
about our ID numbers again.

385
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,420
Secretary Kim.

386
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,421
- Boss?
- Sir?

387
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,215
Not you, her.

388
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,674
What did he say?

389
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,301
He instructed me to
reschedule a meeting.

390
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,845
He said he has an important
matter to attend to.

391
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,597
Is this why HR sent the survey?

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,849
You should've just asked me.

393
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,142
You were mad at me.

394
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,311
Besides, if I asked you
out on a date,

395
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,521
would you have said yes?
