our firstborn Charlie!

my ambition,

we'd already have a baby by now.

372
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,707
I'd probably be carrying
baby Charlie right now, bro.

But no.

375

about my career and myself.

To think that at first,

385
00:17:54,948 --> 00:18:00,162
her family was on the side
of our reconciliation.

386
