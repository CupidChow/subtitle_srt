1
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,314
Our king.

2
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:40,172
My secret...

3
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:41,883
What?

4
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:43,368
What?

5
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:44,618
I really wanna know.

6
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:49,155
I felt Ms. Seoyeon had
something big to say.

7
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:51,520
Something we couldn't just predict or ask.

8
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:54,951
So I couldn't guess at all.

9
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:56,745
I...

10
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:03,237
never dated women.

11
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,168
(Surprised)

12
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:06,644
Really?

13
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:08,364
I thought she was only crazy about women.

14
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:10,447
- I...
- You.

15
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:12,518
- Sorry.
- Me too, me too.

16
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:15,534
I thought you were only
crazy about women too.

17
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:17,949
Because in the past I only

18
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:20,699
had crushes on the opposite sex.

19
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:23,394
- You only had crushes?
- Really?

20
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:26,492
I chose it was my secret

21
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:30,039
because sometimes people like us

22
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:32,423
are biased against

23
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:34,790
people who have never

24
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,308
dated women.

25
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,839
It's natural to worry. Right?

26
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:44,721
And I have an inferiority complex that

27
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:47,121
my feelings were never reciprocated.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,411
And I wanted to meet...

29
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,754
someone who would be

30
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:58,575
my first girlfriend, so
I came on this show.

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,286
It's very meaningful.

32
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,203
Getting to be on this show

33
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:05,492
and come out of the closet.

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,235
It's so cool.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,336
- You must've felt so pressured.
- Really.

36
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:11,828
I just wanted to stop being unreciprocated.

37
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:14,211
(I want to stop being unreciprocated.)

38
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,133
Seoyeon.

39
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:20,047
- Very cool, very cool.
- I applaud you for that.

40
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:25,383
(From now on,
Seoyeon will be able to love proudly.)

41
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,444
What should we do now?

42
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,553
But I relate to you very much.

43
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:32,874
Because there must be
a lot of people like you.

44
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:36,600
To be honest, it's very difficult
for women to date each other

45
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,898
in our country.

46
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:41,509
I bet there are a lot of lesbians

47
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,673
who never dated women before.

48
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:46,893
I'm very grateful that you

49
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,582
had the courage to come out.

50
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:51,207
- It's super awesome.
- It's not easy.

51
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:54,966
I'm sure you'll encounter
only good things from now on.

52
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:55,997
That's right.

53
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:57,324
You made the right choice.

54
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:58,442
- You did.
- Yes..

55
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:01,278
You made the right choice
to come on this show.

56
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:04,630
I felt relieved that everyone tried to

57
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:08,310
understand my feelings.

58
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:12,428
It felt like being comforted.

59
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,257
I want to hug you once,
Ms. Seoyeon. Come here.

60
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,435
- Come here.
- I'm...

61
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,788
I thought it was something bad.

62
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,140
Seriously.

63
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,852
- Must've been so hard.
- The pressure.

64
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:20,891
I couldn't imagine.

65
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,240
In that moment, everyone understood

66
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,421
and there was warmth.

67
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,538
Sharing stories with each other

68
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,296
makes them very memorable.

69
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,452
(While everyone comforts Seoyeon, )

70
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:36,068
In my heart, it's like...

71
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:37,639
Hangyeol.

72
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:44,133
(Jinah asks Hangyeol
to have a private conversation.)

73
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,663
Personally, I don't want you
to feel like that because

74
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:50,335
I acted very immature with that person.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,452
I always saw her as someone to rely on.

76
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:56,156
I've dated both older and younger women.

77
00:03:56,181 --> 00:04:00,000
I dated someone Ms. Hangyeol's age as well.

78
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,536
I told her that people like me

79
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,003
can be attracted to women like her.

80
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:10,028
You said you were
looking for a life partner

81
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:13,793
and someone who could
give you a sense of stability.

82
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,950
When you date someone young,

83
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:21,357
I can't help comparing it because I
can't give anyone that sense of stability.

84
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:23,873
I don't think that's true because...

85
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,927
The thing is I like older women,

86
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:30,154
but I don't stick to
dating only older women.

87
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:32,935
But because we live in an adult world,

88
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,195
because this time I...

89
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,288
When I changed jobs too.

90
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:39,380
I got promoted over a guy in her 40s.

91
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,755
- So cool.
- So everyone

92
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,631
thought that I was cool,

93
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:46,381
so I wanted my girlfriend
to think I was cute.

94
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:49,281
But on the other hand, people my junior

95
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,796
wanted to treat me how
people my senior did.

96
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,101
For me, it was like she was older.

97
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,435
In the past, my girlfriends
who were younger than me

98
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,138
never addressed me as "older sister."

99
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:00,648
Shall we go to my room?

100
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:02,413
(Jinah takes Hangyeol somewhere quiet.)

101
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,319
I never felt, "Goodness, kid,"

102
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:07,107
the way Riwon feels even once.

103
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:10,693
The thought "I must not see them as kids"

104
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:12,663
actually makes me heart race. I mean

105
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,194
not like, "That kid tries."

106
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,436
I think there's the
maturity in young people

107
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:19,202
that older people don't have.

108
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,989
If someone younger calls me
just, "Jinah," it's like...

109
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,459
I will feel like, "This kid."

110
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,530
That's it. So I

111
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:30,506
don't want you to think that
it only applies to someone younger.

112
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,961
There are people like me too.

113
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,960
I'm so shocked right now.

114
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,950
I felt very uncomfortable
so I wanted to talk to you once.

115
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,818
But I always saw you
confide in other people.

116
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:45,186
I thought, "I think I
have the best advice."

117
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,568
- I've been there.
- I didn't expect

118
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:50,528
- to hear something like this.
- Really?

119
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:52,459
I think of myself

120
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,123
as beads

121
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,858
that are easily broken.

122
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,279
That's the image I have of myself.

123
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:01,514
You have the clearest
eyes I have ever seen.

124
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,935
So if I was physically bigger,

125
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,513
if I could do something like that,

126
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:10,230
I might be able to win someone's heart.

127
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:14,159
But I have nothing
like that, so I'm hesitant.

128
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:17,559
No, I was like that once.

129
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,816
Did you know I requested a date with you?

130
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,395
When? Really?

131
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,489
When we texted.

132
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:23,591
Really?

133
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:26,239
Yes, I texted Ms. Jinah.

134
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:27,776
Really?

135
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,223
That's a pity. It's...

136
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,887
I thought you didn't like...
Thought you weren't interested at all.

137
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:35,880
At the time, I had already half given up.

138
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:39,826
I'm someone who loves to read.

139
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,881
- When I meet a writer...
- Talk to a writer?

140
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:45,848
So I thought I should talk to a writer.

141
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:48,145
So I decided to request a date.

142
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,621
Me too. I wanted to talk to you once.

143
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:53,374
Because it never crossed my mind that

144
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,136
someone would give me the opportunity.

145
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:57,661
You think a lot of people like me?

146
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:59,935
Despite liking someone a lot, I'm someone

147
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,335
who thinks that she doesn't like me back.

148
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,661
My heart raced, but in the head
I thought we're 12 years apart.

149
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:09,084
That still bothered me.

150
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:12,061
But for me, love doesn't come from here,

151
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,928
but from somewhere around here.

152
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:18,992
In that moment, if we include today,

153
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,796
I don't know, since we
entered the ToGetHer Houses,

154
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:25,788
it was the happiest
moment I've experienced.

155
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,711
(ToGetHer House 2, ToGetHer)

156
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:35,155
What will they ask today?

157
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,256
Yeah.

158
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,537
Yesterday's question was very original,

159
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,334
so I can't guess today's question.

160
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:43,569
I think it's gonna be that question.

161
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,184
Write a letter to the person
you were on a date with today.

162
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,951
Will they want us to focus one person?

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,271
You think it's gonna be
two people as before?

164
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:53,677
No, not that.

165
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:57,091
Your suggestion is like only write to
the person you were on a date with.

166
00:07:57,116 --> 00:07:59,866
Writing letters affects
the recipients, right?

167
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,756
Roommates went on dates today.

168
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,975
But with today's dates,

169
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,940
many pairs were between people who had

170
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:09,073
always wanted to go on
a date with each other.

171
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,127
I see. Today was like that?

172
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,374
Well, you.

173
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,296
Me? Not me.

174
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:17,163
You went on a one-on-one date.

175
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,520
- Seriously.
- I meant you.

176
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:23,059
No. Well, sure,

177
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:26,019
but you went on that date
because the other person chose you.

178
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:27,854
Our date was like shooting a movie.

179
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,948
- You shot a movie?
- I don't know how that happened,

180
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:33,339
but I don't know what kind of movie it was.

181
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:35,793
You're so funny.

182
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:37,707
What will they ask today?

183
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:39,215
I want to know today's question too.

184
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:44,691
(Who will their hearts yearn for tonight?)

185
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,254
(Ms. Jinah, please go to the heart room.)

186
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,558
It vibrates too hard.

187
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,041
I have to go.

188
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,354
I'll be right back.

189
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,885
(Jinah who looks confused)

190
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,932
(Who has Jinah's heart right now?)

191
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:15,061
For me, writing letters
has been difficult every time.

192
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:18,999
When I walked in,
I was thinking who I should write.

193
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,571
Eh?

194
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:27,727
(Love Calls: the time to confess
your feelings through your voice)

195
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,405
There was a cellphone on the table.

196
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,788
I couldn't think.

197
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:34,271
How do I call?

198
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:37,319
(Pondering)

199
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,171
(Squeezing her eyes shut)

200
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:46,897
(Dialing after much consideration)

201
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:48,757
Hello?

202
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,538
It's Jinah.

203
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:53,514
I'm the only one who overthinks.

204
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:54,662
Someone's calling me.

205
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,295
(Hangyeol's phone rings)

206
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,747
Hello?

207
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,936
It's Jinah.

208
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,624
Hello, it's Jinah.

209
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,467
Oh?

210
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,588
How did you know this number?

211
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:15,430
Well, I don't have much time.

212
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,663
I feel very blessed that

213
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:20,445
we talked earlier.

214
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,993
You'll understand what that means.

215
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,305
- Understand?
- You know what?

216
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,733
I wanted to say the same thing.

217
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:31,147
Which part?

218
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:35,627
I don't know which part.

219
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:40,752
Uh, well... Dang it, the line's cut off.

220
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,339
Oi!

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,680
The 30 seconds I spent on the call

222
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,790
was too short to say what I wanted to say,

223
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,008
and too long to endure
my own embarrassment.

224
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,813
(Jinah's brought to her knees afterward.)

225
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,492
That was crazy.

226
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,272
Ah... Ah...

227
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,841
Actually, yesterday and today
have been very exhausting for me.

228
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,131
Well, with these things,

229
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,576
when there's love in-between,

230
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:31,358
you just don't care about anything.
Everything seems fun.

231
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:36,170
So I was very happy after making the call.

232
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:43,564
What?

233
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,118
How did she know that number?

234
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:50,220
Feels like my heart's gonna explode.

235
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:51,784
Why's that?

236
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,237
How did she know this number?

237
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:58,143
I didn't know how at the time,
so that was my first thought.

238
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,468
So it felt like my heart was gonna explode.

239
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:04,257
I couldn't help thinking
maybe she went out of her way

240
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,507
to ask for my number.

241
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:08,773
I found out later that
wasn't the case, so...

242
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,750
I see, I get it now.

243
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,395
Like my heart's gonna explode.

244
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,996
So how did she know the number?

245
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:20,098
This won't do.

246
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,490
I gave up at first, but not anymore.

247
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,950
That felt good, right?
You seemed relieved earlier.

248
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,255
Yes, it's like nothing's
hanging over my head now.

249
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:32,690
Something like that.

250
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,634
- What?
- I'm...

251
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,015
Other people...

252
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,729
- Oh, that suits you.
- Really?

253
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:41,471
- Why does it look stylish on you?
- Seriously?

254
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,816
When I heard other people's secrets,

255
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:47,887
even I was like, "That's why."

256
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,370
But you looked miserable.

257
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,355
Because I was.

258
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,033
You must have because

259
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:55,760
if you told us from the beginning,

260
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:59,111
I or the others would have
understood this about you

261
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:01,010
and given you some attention.

262
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,682
And we wouldn't have misunderstood.

263
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:03,769
Mm.

264
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:06,371
(Ms. Heeyoung, please
go to the heart room.)

265
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:08,519
Oh, no. It's your phone.

266
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:09,964
Get that done first.

267
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:11,684
- Yours' over there.
- Why? Is this okay?

268
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,009
It's snagging my hair.

269
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:16,823
It suits you. Look in the mirror.

270
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:20,285
It suits you, right? Wear it.

271
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,058
- I don't think so.
- No?

272
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,636
It does suit me, but not today.

273
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:26,620
- It's my style.
- You like it?

274
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:29,878
You've been flirting with me.

275
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,018
Good luck.

276
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:33,425
I'll be right back.

277
00:13:35,268 --> 00:13:36,791
It's crazy.

278
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,650
Oi...

279
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,574
Everyone knows my secret now.

280
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,306
We all know each other's age.

281
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,173
It makes me look at
that person differently.

282
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:51,719
This is killing me.

283
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:55,591
It makes that person look more balanced.

284
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:58,422
I understand more,
so everyone looks attractive.

285
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,234
(Heeyoung enters the heart room.)

286
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:12,992
(Surprised)

287
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,625
(Hahaha)

288
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:23,976
(Call and confess your
feelings in 30 seconds.)

289
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,312
To be honest, I thought I should call.

290
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,079
Ms. Dagyo or Ms. Minwoo

291
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:32,829
who had shown interest in me.

292
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:35,900
Ugh, it's too little time.

293
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:46,301
(Heeyoung dials after much consideration.)

294
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:48,928
Hello?

295
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,663
- Hello?
- Yes.?

296
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,608
(Who is Heeyoung calling?)

297
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,534
Hello?

298
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:03,682
Yes?

299
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:08,516
They have us call the person
we're interested in, so I called.

300
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:10,250
Eh? That's not me.

301
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,594
- Eh?
- You called the wrong person.

302
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:17,576
I called the right person.

303
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,240
- Eh?
- I said I called the right person.

304
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:24,194
Oh, really?

305
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:30,862
But there's no time left.

306
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:32,440
Bye.

307
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,344
But there's no time left.

308
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:39,726
Bye.

309
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,029
I knew right before the line cut off.

310
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,435
This time they had us call someone.

311
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,170
Oh, that was Heeyoung.

312
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:50,935
I knew right then.

313
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,153
Actually, I'm still not convinced.

314
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:57,045
If I felt what I had felt...

315
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,343
when I first met her,

316
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,320
I would have been very happy, but

317
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:07,035
now I feel platonic toward her.

318
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,810
I only see her as a friend now.

319
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,552
When we told our secrets,

320
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:14,238
it intensified what I felt toward her.

321
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:17,731
And I was the one who
had seen her suffer as a friend.

322
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:18,973
So I wanted to encourage her,

323
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:22,919
And it was an encouragement between
two people who care about each other.

324
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:27,123
I really hope she
won't attach herself to it.

325
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:29,397
And there's not much time left now.

326
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,210
I want her to try again.

327
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:34,999
I thought so far she'd been
handling everything herself

328
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:37,780
and overthinking about trivial things.

329
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,547
But now I know that wasn't the case.

330
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,297
So I decided to call Ms. Seoyeon.

331
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,580
Eh?

332
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,275
What?

333
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:52,666
What?

334
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,545
What should I do now?

335
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,820
Not again.

336
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:02,719
I'm gonna fail at confessing again.

337
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,719
Fail at confessing?

338
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:05,892
- Yes..
- Why?

339
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:07,974
I'm gonna fail.

340
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,782
What should I do? That won't work today.

341
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,587
- Are you crying again?
- No, I'm not.

342
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:14,727
Why?

343
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,509
No, I really can't today.

344
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,914
Why?

345
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:19,695
It's a phone call.

346
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,774
So what?

347
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,711
- I can't really call today.
- Why not?

348
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,108
So what's admirers' university?

349
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:26,522
What are you talking about?

350
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,718
That wasn't you?

351
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,518
They have us call
the person we're interested in.

352
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,057
I thought your said admirers' university.

353
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,572
What the heck are you talking about?

354
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,853
This is hard.

355
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,580
Why? Who are you interested in?

356
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,078
Call her.

357
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,274
- Ugh.
- Why?

358
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,626
It's not easy.

359
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:53,977
Why not?

360
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,649
It's not easy for me.

361
00:17:56,728 --> 00:17:58,845
Why are you cold-hearted again?

362
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:03,108
Forget the situation.
Just call the person you're attracted to.

363
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,336
How can I call her?

364
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:08,937
Are you crying?

365
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:10,656
Are you crying?

366
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,295
How can I call her?

367
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,727
Why? What's the problem? Hey.

368
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,050
What's wrong?

369
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,372
How can you call her?

370
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:25,310
- Yes..
- Why can't you call her?

371
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:27,481
Have you never called anyone?

372
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:28,638
Are you scared?

373
00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:32,083
Are you scared of calling?

374
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:35,638
- Is calling scary?
- How can I call her?

375
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,395
Have you written her letters?

376
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,067
Mm, I have written her letters.

377
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:42,989
(Giggling)

378
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:46,779
Then you already chose.

379
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,826
But I can't call her.

380
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,342
Reveal yourself,
so she'll pay you some attention.

381
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,279
Aren't you happy I called?

382
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,967
But you...

383
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,990
That was a sincere call.

384
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,560
Let's clear the air. At first you...

385
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,982
It's not because you never dated women.

386
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,771
But it's the image you present.

387
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,490
It's understandable
and it's what draws out your identity.

388
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:15,450
So your actions in the past...

389
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:17,430
- Understandable?
- It's a good thing.

390
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,822
The image you present,

391
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:22,281
if you didn't express what was inside
directly, I wouldn't have understood.

392
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:23,556
But once I knew,

393
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,806
I've realized that
you're very straightforward.

394
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:27,486
- Really?
- Yes..

395
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,729
I think so.

396
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:30,822
At first...

397
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:33,338
Oh, it's mine?

398
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,377
Hello?

399
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:39,855
Mm. What are you doing?

400
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:41,736
Who's this?

401
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,861
(Who's calling Heeyoung?)

402
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,838
- I'm Minwoo.
- Ah, oh.

403
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,134
Where are you? What are you doing?

404
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,614
I'm in my room.

405
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,415
Your room? Mm...

406
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:01,579
(Glancing)

407
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,055
(Embarrassed)

408
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,319
What? She hung up.

409
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,209
I thought since I
didn't call, she wouldn't.

410
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,053
Because she's suddenly always around me.

411
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,100
She expresses herself
in the way that lets me know.

412
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,647
I'm very grateful.

413
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:24,890
(Regretting)

414
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:30,307
Mm, I probably have to see her in her room.

415
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:36,180
When I saw we could speak for 30 seconds,

416
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:39,578
I thought I had to call Ms. Heeyoung.

417
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:41,353
Ms. Heeyoung is someone who

418
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,226
might not get it even after I did that.

419
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:47,775
And she doesn't like someone
who likes to be approached directly,

420
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,868
so I don't want to make her uncomfortable.

421
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,391
But I didn't think
30 seconds would be that short.

422
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:53,906
Minwoo, right?

423
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:56,687
- Minwoo, right?
- Huh? I don't know.

424
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:57,875
It's Minwoo.

425
00:20:58,532 --> 00:20:59,836
Minwoo's not bad.

426
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,749
You don't know anything.

427
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:04,582
(Ms. Seoyeon, please go to the heart room.)
Minwoo's good, pretty.

428
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:06,225
Your turn?

429
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,918
- Ugh, it's driving me crazy.
- You have to do it.

430
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,651
- What if I don't?
- Do it for yourself,

431
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,777
not someone else.

432
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:19,358
What if I don't?

433
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:21,053
If you don't, it stays like this.

434
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,215
Ugh.

435
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,121
Initially, I'd given up on everything.

436
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:37,168
But today was special
because it was a phone call.

437
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:38,703
Different from anonymous letters.

438
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:42,568
So she'd know it was me from my voice.

439
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:46,613
And I'd hear her voice and acknowledge

440
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,706
with my own ears.

441
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:52,339
I'd get a chance to understand her.

442
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:55,020
It was an opportunity to show her directly

443
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:57,436
that I was interested in her.

444
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:00,880
I had to give it a try once
so it wouldn't feel unfinished.

445
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:07,904
(Squeezing her eyes shut)

446
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:16,670
(Seoyeon has so much to say
but can't say it all at once.)

447
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:22,058
(Hand shaking)

448
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,589
(An extremely difficult call to make)

449
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:29,831
(Worried)

450
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:32,940
Hello?

451
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,457
Hi.

452
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,043
(The person Seoyeon finally
has the courage to call is...)

453
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,911
Hello?

454
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:54,247
Eh? Hello?

455
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,301
Hi.

456
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,653
Eh? Hello?

457
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:04,192
Hi.

458
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,449
Huh? Hello?

459
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:12,917
(Noticing)

460
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,558
What...

461
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,136
Eh?

462
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:23,730
(Embarrassed)

463
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:32,171
It was so short. Shockingly short.

464
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,069
But when the line cut off,

465
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:36,530
I hadn't said anything, but

466
00:23:36,555 --> 00:23:41,406
I didn't expect her to
acknowledge my feelings.

467
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,178
But in my heart, I felt a relief

468
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,185
and hoped that it'd make me give up hope.

469
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,890
It was a complete relief.

470
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,851
It was like...

471
00:23:51,357 --> 00:23:53,341
there was nothing left to hope for.

472
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,865
There's nothing left.

473
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:01,710
Huh?

474
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:05,218
Just like that?

475
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:09,557
Did you hear her?

476
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:10,675
- Was it loud enough?
- No.

477
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,011
- No.
- Really?

478
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,694
It was just a couple of words,

479
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,712
but I heard the weight of her voice

480
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:18,852
so I only thought of Ms. Seoyeon.

481
00:24:18,877 --> 00:24:22,345
After I'd heard her
secret, I thought of her.

482
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:24,095
Because she said she'd never dated women.

483
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,580
I was very grateful she
had the courage to call.

484
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:31,640
Ms. Heeyoung used to be Dagyo's roommate

485
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:34,055
and is someone Dagyo's interested in.

486
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,118
Dagyo will probably hit on her.

487
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:39,086
That will make her take notice.

488
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:45,281
I thought to myself, "What should I say?"

489
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:46,390
It almost drove me crazy.

490
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:49,295
Calling someone is very embarrassing.

491
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,968
I'm sure about who to call,

492
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:53,054
but to call her like this...

493
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:55,140
What should I say?

494
00:24:58,459 --> 00:24:59,592
(Pondering)

495
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:02,069
What should I say?

496
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:05,295
I thought of what to say for a long time.

497
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,949
Because it was just 30 seconds.
What should I say?

498
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,882
The secret was out anyway.

499
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:12,397
When she said she had ADHD,

500
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:13,459
I felt a little guilty.

501
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,678
But she tries to be nice to me.

502
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:19,546
She remembers everything I said
and tries to do things for me.

503
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:23,383
Today I don't want her
to be confused anymore, so I called.

504
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,220
Hello?

505
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,462
Older sister.

506
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,814
It's Dagyo.

507
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:31,923
Hello?

508
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:34,009
- Older sister.
- Oh.

509
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,274
- It's Dagyo.
- Oh.

510
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,219
Today we listened to each other's secrets.

511
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Mm.

512
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:44,569
I feel like I was beating around
the bush too much yesterday.

513
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:47,203
- Mm.
- I feel very guilty.

514
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:50,039
You're not so confused today, right?

515
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:51,750
(Cute)

516
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:54,577
Yes, because you were honest with me.

517
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:57,023
- So I understood.
- Okay.

518
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:58,671
Okay, that's it.

519
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:04,657
(Embarrassed)

520
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,552
I see.

521
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,968
What the heck?

522
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:16,023
(Embarrassed)

523
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,262
I said I wouldn't confuse her today.

524
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,427
I was blushing when I left the room.

525
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:30,826
I'm very happy.

526
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:35,419
Oh, it's so hot.

527
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:36,662
(Slipping)
Goodness.

528
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:38,972
Did you fall?

529
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:41,332
You startled me. What? Why are you here?

530
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,058
You're here.

531
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:45,852
No, I didn't fall.

532
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,742
I have a lot to say but I'd better not.

533
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:51,297
(Heart racing)
My heart was racing.

534
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,498
What were you gonna say? If the...

535
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:58,530
If the time comes, I can say it?

536
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,483
Don't know, don't know.

537
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,319
You haven't gone yet.

538
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,787
Coming here...

539
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,873
is not healthy at all.

540
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:11,167
It's not good for the heart.

541
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:12,807
Heart?

542
00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:17,761
(Ms. Mirang, please go to the heart room.)

543
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,543
(Troubled)

544
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,326
I'll be back.

545
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:28,216
(Nodding.)
Huh.

546
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,662
I don't know what to do.

547
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:39,616
I was thinking what I should do

548
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,091
to show her my feelings more clearly,

549
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:44,795
so I tried to articulate it.

550
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,381
Ugh, seriously.

551
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,405
I see. 30 seconds.

552
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,784
(The moment she wonders
how to confess her feelings)

553
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,480
I thought I wouldn't be excited,
but I was very excited.

554
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:06,316
(Dagyo's waiting for Mirang's phone call.)

555
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,050
After Mirang left, there
was no phone calls.

556
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:11,144
What the heck?

557
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,206
I'm too excited.

558
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:22,842
(Mirang's dialing
after hesitating for a long time.)

559
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,273
Hello?

560
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:37,515
It's me, Mirang.

561
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:39,257
Mm.

562
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:41,519
Mm.

563
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:43,949
Huh?

564
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,511
I like you more and more.

565
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:52,373
I miss you and I'm jealous too.

566
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,804
And...

567
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,369
Let's just say I miss you even now.

568
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,986
I'll go to you right now.

569
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:16,283
(Mirang's confession
despite her embarrassment)

570
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,806
I think I told her my feelings clearly.

571
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:27,528
After her call, it was like
my heart was gonna explode.

572
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,543
I was so embarrassed.

573
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,614
The letters are just written words.

574
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,731
But this time I heard her voice.

575
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,405
And after that moment passed,

576
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,410
we still had to sleep in the same room.

577
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,275
Ugh, what should I do tonight?

578
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,707
That thought occurred to me.

579
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:50,188
(Sneaking in)

580
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,594
Why did you come back so fast?

581
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,759
Or was it because you have long legs?

582
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:03,548
- You have long legs, so you're back quickly?
- I ran here.

583
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:05,009
- You ran?
- Yes..

584
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,049
Why?

585
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,182
Why did you run?

586
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,743
We just hung up and you're here.

587
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:13,768
You startled me.

588
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:14,793
That's all.

589
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,165
I'm even more embarrassed
sharing a room with you.

590
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:24,212
You said you wanted us to share a room.

591
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,610
My face's gonna be so red it explodes.

592
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,196
(Sighing)

593
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:35,532
What should I do now?

594
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,438
(Mirang's more embarrassed than Dagyo.)

595
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,463
The current situation is driving me crazy.

596
00:30:44,768 --> 00:30:46,541
Driving us both crazy.

597
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:49,690
We do like each other,
but we're around each other too much.

598
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,522
We don't know how to act.

599
00:30:52,374 --> 00:30:54,295
When you really think about it,

600
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:56,186
it's very hot.

601
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,162
Oh, an email.

602
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,379
(Ms. Hangyeol, please
go to the heart room.) Wait.

603
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:07,412
Hold on, hold on.

604
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:11,224
I'll go in ten seconds.

605
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:12,357
Ten, nine...

606
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,583
- Good luck.
- I'm gonna go.

607
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:18,592
Okay.

608
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,474
Let's go.

609
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,669
(Who will Hangyeol
confess her feelings to today?)

610
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,805
I think I should call back

611
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,751
the person who called me.

612
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:55,838
And there was something
I wanted to tell her.

613
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:02,044
- Wait a sec.
- What's that?

614
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,075
Isn't it?

615
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:06,044
Hello?

616
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,575
Hello?

617
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,959
This is so unfair.

618
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,731
I was the one who called first.

619
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:19,200
Oi, it's not fun now.

620
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,200
It's... it's Hangyeol.

621
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,594
I remember your voice.

622
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,531
I...

623
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,576
Everyone's past...

624
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,356
From what I heard here...

625
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:37,483
Mm.

626
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:41,873
Is this girl stupid?

627
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:45,685
I think your past...

628
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:50,999
I guess it's 30 seconds.

629
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:54,772
Oh, it's 30 seconds.

630
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,858
I saw the word "phone"

631
00:33:00,883 --> 00:33:03,772
and didn't think how short 30 seconds were.

632
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:05,242
Your story...

633
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:08,491
is the most beautiful.

634
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,366
Actually, I was a little surprised

635
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,053
so I kept talking after

636
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:16,870
the phone had cut off.

637
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:19,307
I just wanted to tell her.

638
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,782
There are only stupid people living here.

639
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:26,525
- Why?
- Did you finish talking in 30 seconds?

640
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,330
Finished talking? Of course.

641
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,221
The line cut off mid-conversation.

642
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,165
How embarrassed was that girl

643
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,621
when the phone cut off?

644
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,267
I get embarrassed

645
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:41,635
just thinking about it.

646
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,772
I blame myself.

647
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:43,845
"Hey, Kim Jinah."

648
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,837
"If you don't talk about
being the one who called first,"

649
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:49,252
"we wouldn't have
wasted those five seconds."

650
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,120
She would have looked less stupid.

651
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:54,128
It was funny at the time.

652
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:56,566
Since we arrived at the houses,

653
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,454
the time we've talked up to that point,

654
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:03,032
for me, it's heaven.

655
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,758
You wrote letters already?

656
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,493
I feel nauseous.

657
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:10,069
- You wrote very quickly.
- The time was...

658
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:12,415
- Huh?
- They gave us very little time.

659
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,280
- Huh?
- They gave us very little time.

660
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:15,547
What do you mean?

661
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:16,836
Did they rush you to write?

662
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,266
(Sighing)

663
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:25,399
(ToGetHer House 1, calling time is over.)

664
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:28,421
I don't wanna look narcissistic
for saying this.

665
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,562
And Riwon said she liked Hangyeol.

666
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,850
But Hangyeol and I...

667
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,256
Ever since I said my career involved books,

668
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,155
we've made a lot of eye contact.

669
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:43,897
Oh.

670
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:46,350
But we never made eye contact before that.

671
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:48,631
With Hangyeol?

672
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:51,359
We didn't even try to talk.

673
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,195
You guys talked a lot today.

674
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,788
Here's the thing.

675
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:58,009
Suddenly, Hangyeol stopped
calling me "older sister"

676
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,110
and started calling me "Ms."

677
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:02,509
Really? Since when?

678
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:04,571
Since I gave an example
of a younger girlfriend.

679
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:06,354
Right after? When did you guys talk?

680
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,385
After we revealed our secrets?

681
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,096
After that we talked one-on-one, right?

682
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,280
I was worried it'd become
a trauma unwittingly.

683
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:15,630
After that kind of talk?

684
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,295
The experiences that we've gotten here.

685
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,084
The gray experiences.

686
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:22,224
The gray experiences
in front of older women.

687
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,240
Mm, can we go to the living room?

688
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:26,990
Shall we leave?

689
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,963
(Leaving so they can talk candidly)
What's up?

690
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,599
That thing.

691
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:36,168
As I said earlier, how she addresses me.

692
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:39,097
Before that she said, "I'll fangirl you."

693
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:41,105
"Older sister, let's talk about books."

694
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,472
And suddenly she started calling me "Ms."

695
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:46,019
So cute.

696
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:48,698
Like she tried to let you know.

697
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,519
- That too.
- So...

698
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:52,910
Did you call Hangyeol today?

699
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:56,807
Do you know what stupid think Jeong did?

700
00:35:56,832 --> 00:36:00,379
"I think your past..." Beep.

701
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:06,291
What does that mean? She called you?

702
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,043
You both called each other?

703
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,934
- But the funny thing is...
- Really?

704
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:10,973
But the funny thing is

705
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,115
she said yesterday
she'd requested a date with me.

706
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,458
- Really?
- Yes..

707
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:16,222
That's what's tangled.

708
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:18,208
There was an issue with Heeyoung yesterday

709
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,075
about us not getting a date.

710
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:22,630
(Hangyeol requesting a date with Jinah)
Goodness. That's why.

711
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:24,574
(has tangled the love threads.)
She requested me.

712
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:26,638
I'm shocked.

713
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,974
When we went go-karting,
Hangyeol told me...

714
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:33,880
she'd requested a date with me.

715
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,972
What kind of women wouldn't feel their
hearts pounding when they hear someone

716
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:39,372
requested a date with them?

717
00:36:39,778 --> 00:36:43,582
(Her heart wavered by unexpected words.)

718
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,204
The funny thing for me is

719
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:48,891
we didn't call each other because

720
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,626
we'd had a brief deep conversation.

721
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:52,196
That's the thing. I'm shocked

722
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:55,040
because I wasn't aware at all.

723
00:36:55,662 --> 00:36:56,868
This is what I think.

724
00:36:58,107 --> 00:37:00,224
If she was older, I'd
definitely like her a lot.

725
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:01,771
Something like that.

726
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,208
This kind of relationship is so nice.

727
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,161
- Very unexpected.
- Now it feels so fun.

728
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:09,364
I'm starting to invest
in this relationship.

729
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:11,061
- That's good.
- At first I was

730
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:12,812
very adamant about Heeyoung, but I...

731
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:14,555
To be honest,

732
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:15,868
I was well aware

733
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:18,373
we wouldn't work but I forced it
until it turned out like this.

734
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,610
(The night where new
feelings start to develop)

735
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,475
(Meanwhile Mirang is with Minwoo.)

736
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,531
I'm frustrated.

737
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:30,844
But now...

738
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,032
I got three letters yesterday.

739
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:39,712
But I probably can't view
them all as positive letters.

740
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:43,640
There was one that
looks like your handwriting.

741
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:45,172
- Huh? Me?
- Yes..

742
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,601
- Me?
- Yes..

743
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,359
(Unbelievable)
I didn't write it.

744
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:49,798
Not the one I like.

745
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,875
(Minwoo's guess is off by a mile.)
A rival?

746
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,048
I didn't write you at all.

747
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:55,805
What it is about my handwriting?
Why does everyone...

748
00:37:55,837 --> 00:37:58,911
Why does everyone assume
a bad handwriting is mine?

749
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,035
I wrote Ms. Heeyoung.

750
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:07,455
A love rival letter.

751
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:12,281
So there's something
between those two, huh?

752
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:13,462
Probably.

753
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:16,925
But they went on a one-on-one date today.

754
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:18,301
Mm.

755
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:23,058
It feels like we're closer.

756
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,345
Heeyoung probably called Dagyo.

757
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:31,735
(Mirang's suspicion toward Heeyoung)

758
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:32,805
But now...

759
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,797
what I'm feeling...

760
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:41,172
Now she shares a room
with Ms. Seoyeon, right?

761
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:44,274
She said they were just friends.

762
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,237
I think it was Ms. Seoyeon.

763
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,002
Probably after she revealed her secret.

764
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,607
Ms. Heeyoung...

765
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,747
is more sensitive than I thought.

766
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,958
That's how I feel.

767
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,322
- That's it, right?
- Yes..

768
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,808
It smells...

769
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:13,363
(Mirang notices that Riwon's crying.)

770
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:14,871
Be careful.

771
00:39:15,926 --> 00:39:17,051
Older sister.

772
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:19,355
- Older sister.
- Why calling me that suddenly?

773
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,481
- Older sister.
- What's the matter?

774
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,246
Oh, nothing.

775
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,536
(Riwon escapes quickly.)

776
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:30,692
Why?

777
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:31,817
(What happened?)

778
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:39,715
(Jinah goes to check on Riwon
who looks different.)

779
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,114
Can we not talk?

780
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:50,914
(Riwon dodges Jinah and go upstairs.)

781
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:57,734
(The atmosphere turns
cold in a split second.)

782
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,836
(The ToGetHer Houses are full of
a variety of mixed feelings.)

783
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,531
(A new morning on Jeju Island)

784
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:14,430
(The fifth day at the ToGetHer Houses)

785
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:17,399
What do you think we'll do today?

786
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:20,274
Have you seen me sit around and guess?

787
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:21,649
That's true.

788
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,383
If they say, "You'll be doing this today,"

789
00:40:24,408 --> 00:40:26,219
I'll be like, "Oh, I see," and do it.

790
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:29,978
There used to be three
people. Now it's two.

791
00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:31,681
It's so nice.

792
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:34,814
There's more space on the clothes rack.

793
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,839
New duvet cover.

794
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:41,354
I feel very good.

795
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:47,277
What's that?

796
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:48,652
- Hinoki cypress scent?
- Yes..

797
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:49,809
You want some?

798
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:50,926
No, I'm good.

799
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:52,949
It smells very nice.

800
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:54,980
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yes.

801
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:56,785
I love Hinoki cypress.

802
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,621
I woke up this morning

803
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:01,668
and found a new
roommate. It's kind of strange.

804
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:04,555
I could feel the void Mirang had left.

805
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,970
But I'm glad because we're friends.

806
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:08,580
It's also nice to get something new.

807
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:13,588
(Mirang looking busy early in the morning)

808
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:19,733
The person I wanted to see
in the morning was Dagyo.

809
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:23,476
When I woke up and saw
her, my heart was pounding.

810
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,680
Oh, you already have water?

811
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:29,882
Yes.

812
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,087
This is cold water.

813
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:34,796
Thank you.

814
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:38,131
To be honest, it's different
from when I stayed with Heeyoung.

815
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:43,022
Now when I wake up, I
can feel that she's there.

816
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,180
So my focus is on her right away.

817
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,990
I slept very well last night.

818
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,310
I feel like I haven't
had a good night's sleep

819
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:54,224
in this kind of quiet

820
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:55,646
in such a long time.

821
00:41:56,206 --> 00:41:59,621
- It has to be quiet for me to sleep.
- I just passed out.

822
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,890
It's very nice. The room is bigger.

823
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,531
After moving to a two-people bedroom,
I slept very well

824
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:07,954
I feel very energetic.

825
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:10,970
And Ms. Jinah is very funny.

826
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,393
- Jinah!
- Huh?

827
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:14,862
Let me know when you leave!

828
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:15,887
Let's go together.

829
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:17,176
How can I go alone?

830
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,174
I'm terrified right now.

831
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:21,699
Don't be scared, girl.

832
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:26,075
The other day Riwon was very mad at me.

833
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,590
I feel guilty of hurting her feelings.

834
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:31,489
But the person I'm interested in
is interested in me.

835
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:34,107
So... Mm...

836
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:36,576
This morning, there's a crack

837
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,325
in yesterday's happiness.

838
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,568
So I left the house a little scared.

839
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,014
(Will they be able to untangle
their messy relationships?)

840
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:49,701
Maybe today we will randomly...

841
00:42:50,086 --> 00:42:51,141
What's this?

842
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,957
(Kim Jinah❤︎‬Jeong Hangyeol
and Kim Mirang❤︎Park Dagyo)

843
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:56,159
(who called each other yesterday)

844
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:57,542
(will go on a one-on-one date)

845
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,447
(by choosing the keywords
"single" or "double.")

846
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,187
(Surprised)

847
00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:03,195
I thought I was okay

848
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,523
but when I saw a heart between
the names Kim Mirang and Park Dagyo,

849
00:43:06,548 --> 00:43:08,414
from the text message,

850
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:10,470
my heart just dropped.

851
00:43:10,518 --> 00:43:14,407
Because I saw it with my own eyes.

852
00:43:14,432 --> 00:43:15,532
Seeing that

853
00:43:15,587 --> 00:43:19,032
made me a little sad.

854
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:20,766
Double, double.

855
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,485
We're choosing "double"?

856
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,515
Can we discuss it?

857
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,610
How do you want, Hangyeol?

858
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:28,071
"Single" and "double"
probably doesn't mean beds.

859
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:29,666
- What are you saying?
- Probably not.

860
00:43:29,705 --> 00:43:30,908
Right.

861
00:43:30,948 --> 00:43:32,830
Then what? Hamburgers?

862
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,033
(Laughing unexpectedly)

863
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,969
I like that kind of jokes.

864
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:39,564
I don't know. "Double" sounds good.

865
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:42,771
You two have already been on a date,

866
00:43:42,796 --> 00:43:44,505
so maybe you should go with double.

867
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:47,480
These two should go on one-on-one.

868
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,316
That's why I want them to choose.

869
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:50,863
So let these two choose.

870
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:53,441
A single date or a double date.

871
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:55,902
Like one couple or two couples on a date.

872
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:59,159
Or do you think it means
going on a date with yourself?

873
00:43:59,184 --> 00:44:02,144
No, I choose one-on-one.

874
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:03,416
- Oh, one-on-one.
- One-on-one.

875
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,034
- Mm.
- Okay.

876
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:06,284
Thank you.

877
00:44:06,554 --> 00:44:09,034
I just want to know what they are.

878
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,840
- What does the keywords mean?
- Me too.

879
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:12,526
Dagyo didn't want that.

880
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,283
I thought that a double would be more fun

881
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:19,603
than a single date.

882
00:44:19,628 --> 00:44:21,276
That was why I chose it.

883
00:44:21,643 --> 00:44:23,134
Actually, I didn't mind either

884
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,900
because we'd already gone on a date.

885
00:44:24,925 --> 00:44:27,448
So I wanted the pair
going on their first date to choose.

886
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,979
But I think it worked out well.

887
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,252
Everyone started discussing

888
00:44:32,277 --> 00:44:34,846
if it meant a single date and double date.

889
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:37,511
Everyone was guessing.

890
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:41,197
Since we got this
chance, I wanted to talk to

891
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,806
the person I have feelings for.

892
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:46,213
I wanted us to focus
on each other a little bit more.

893
00:44:46,238 --> 00:44:48,791
So I said that "single" would be better.

894
00:44:49,442 --> 00:44:51,559
After seeing a heart between our names,

895
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:55,488
I was worried I'd be even more hated.

896
00:44:55,513 --> 00:44:56,910
I think that kind of feeling

897
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:59,403
shouldn't be involved in relationships.

898
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:01,521
If I speak from my heart,

899
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,592
I was very happy to get to go on a date.

900
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,570
So I secretly pity myself

901
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,787
for feeling something unnecessary.

902
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,994
So who already cooked us meals?

903
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:14,210
Who already cooked? Please raise your hand?

904
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,312
Me.

905
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:16,695
We never cooked. You never did?

906
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,976
Didn't we cook yesterday
when we helped prepare?

907
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,579
- Damn.
- Oh.

908
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,374
(Today's cooks are Dagyo and Seoyeon.)

909
00:45:24,399 --> 00:45:25,555
Goodness.

910
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,414
Ms. Seoyeon and I never cooked.

911
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:31,898
So the person who's going to cook with me

912
00:45:31,939 --> 00:45:34,898
should be someone who's here.

913
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:37,715
Because Ms. Dagyo is going out.

914
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,506
We'll come back before dinner.
We'll cook after that.

915
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:43,288
- People usually return early after a date.
- Before dinner.

916
00:45:43,313 --> 00:45:44,765
Do you dare?

917
00:45:46,314 --> 00:45:48,203
So can you two do it?

918
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:49,674
- Yes.
- Yes.

919
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:50,822
What should I make?

920
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:54,794
Well, it'd be great if
you can make something

921
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:56,715
out of the food in the fridge.

922
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,364
- I'm a horrible cook. You?
- First time in a year.

923
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,444
In a year?

924
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:01,631
You're worse than I am.

925
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:04,247
You can make rolled
omelette or use the ham.

926
00:46:04,272 --> 00:46:06,178
Then I want kimchi stew.

927
00:46:06,203 --> 00:46:07,208
With kimchi stew?

928
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:08,436
I'll make kimchi stew.

929
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:11,897
- I'll just make kimchi stew and that's it.
- Oh, you're gonna help?

930
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:14,100
- I see.
- So you'll make everything.

931
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,061
- What?
- There's rolled omelette.

932
00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:18,389
I have a very delicious kimchi stew recipe.

933
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:20,639
- Then you make it.
- I'll help you.

934
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:22,593
Fighting over who gets to cook.

935
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,489
No, I want to make you guys nice dinner.

936
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:30,457
Then I'll help make kimchi stew.

937
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:31,875
There's kimchi stew,

938
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,661
fried eggs, and ham.

939
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:35,701
Simple food.

940
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,677
- Simple food, okay?
- Great.

941
00:46:43,098 --> 00:46:45,465
I want to wear this too.

942
00:46:48,053 --> 00:46:50,498
- Mm, pretty.
- Is this better?

943
00:46:50,903 --> 00:46:51,903
Okay.

944
00:46:51,928 --> 00:46:53,553
You put a lot of thought into this

945
00:46:53,592 --> 00:46:55,764
because you're going out
with a different person.

946
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:57,819
I want to do that.

947
00:46:57,842 --> 00:46:58,842
Do what?

948
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:02,217
My dressing style is very different
from Ms. Hangyeol's, right?

949
00:47:02,336 --> 00:47:05,070
I want people to see the difference.

950
00:47:06,913 --> 00:47:09,107
I never told anyone this.

951
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:11,991
When I went on dates with Heeyoung,

952
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:14,350
I never felt so embarrassed
I almost went crazy.

953
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:18,413
The embarrassment
that almost drives people crazy.

954
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:22,582
"That's it. That's what flirtation is."

955
00:47:27,653 --> 00:47:30,234
Ms. Jinah...

956
00:47:30,259 --> 00:47:33,170
The concerns she has

957
00:47:33,195 --> 00:47:35,148
and her feeling of loneliness,

958
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:37,409
I want to help ease those feelings.

959
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:38,668
Responsibility.

960
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,213
I think this feeling is
overtaking everything.

961
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:43,667
I want to change the feelings she has.

962
00:47:43,692 --> 00:47:45,316
I want to comfort her.

963
00:47:48,668 --> 00:47:52,121
(Hangyeol comes to
pick up Jinah at House 1.)

964
00:47:52,373 --> 00:47:54,869
Whoa, you're so beautiful today.

965
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:56,496
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

966
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:59,535
Wow, very beautiful.

967
00:48:00,642 --> 00:48:02,707
I'm off... Oh, my laptop.

968
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:04,143
Shall we go?

969
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:06,874
- Shall we?
- Go flirt outside.

970
00:48:06,914 --> 00:48:09,265
- Ms. Dagyo, shall we go?
- Go flirt outside.

971
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,273
Goodness, go be smoochy somewhere else.

972
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:15,445
I thought, "What am I gonna do
with this mature kid?"

973
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,405
She was dressed up very nicely today.

974
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,976
The person I was interested in
always dressed the same way.

975
00:48:21,016 --> 00:48:24,375
But when we went on a date,
she was dressed up very well.

976
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:26,828
That seriously made my heart flutter.

977
00:48:29,936 --> 00:48:33,444
(Jinah and Hangyeol take off first.)

978
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:36,975
So lucky the weather is good today.

979
00:48:37,007 --> 00:48:38,436
Yes.

980
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,492
Is the sun too strong?

981
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,734
Mm, I can manage.

982
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,610
I really wanted to come out.

983
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,367
I didn't come out at all yesterday.

984
00:48:49,392 --> 00:48:51,788
I was here too when you guys made pottery.

985
00:48:51,813 --> 00:48:53,325
You've been inside the whole time?

986
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:56,065
- So your first time in two days.
- Yes.

987
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,609
Take in the air outside.

988
00:49:06,285 --> 00:49:07,285
Why's my voice like this?

989
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,073
(Jinah's laughter that hasn't
been heard in a while)

990
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:21,241
Oh, sorry, sorry.

991
00:49:21,445 --> 00:49:22,686
Are you okay?

992
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:26,295
Oh, the duo MeloMance.

993
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,412
(Where is Jinah and Hangyeol?)

994
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:35,639
(The place where you can listen
to various genres of music)

995
00:49:37,197 --> 00:49:39,248
(Jeju Island's vinyl cafe)

996
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,796
The place we went on a date

997
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:45,272
was a vinyl cafe.

998
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,225
I saw Hangyeol's eyes
when I stood next to her.

999
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,960
Her eyes were filled with passion.

1000
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:51,937
We had lot of things to talk about.

1001
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:55,812
I could see she was very intrigued.
I felt good too.

1002
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:58,799
So I think it was a good date.

1003
00:49:58,824 --> 00:50:02,408
Back home I collect vinyl records.

1004
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:05,511
If it's music, it's my lane.

1005
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:08,487
So I thought I had to try using this

1006
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:10,395
to get her attention.

1007
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,676
Explain turntables to her.

1008
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:15,989
If you could do that, it would be amazing.

1009
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,715
So my eyes went huge.

1010
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,254
I have something I want to tell you.

1011
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:23,060
I have a clear reason.

1012
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:24,107
I'm curious.

1013
00:50:24,132 --> 00:50:25,348
Shall we sit?

1014
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:27,615
Can I sit there?

1015
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,974
(Sitting side by side
to listen to the music)

1016
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,724
How do we listen?

1017
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,365
It's already connected to the headphones.

1018
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,224
We should be able to listen right away.

1019
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:47,335
The wire's usually on the left side.

1020
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,514
- The wire?
- Yes, the wire like this.

1021
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:51,694
- If they're...
- Oh.

1022
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,335
If they're wired headphones.

1023
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,412
It sounds strange.

1024
00:50:55,459 --> 00:50:57,794
It hasn't started yet.

1025
00:50:57,819 --> 00:51:00,794
The turntable makes
a very strong contact with the record,

1026
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:02,635
so you hear a lot of crackling sound.

1027
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,556
The headphones amplify the sound.

1028
00:51:05,581 --> 00:51:08,113
They're amplifiers, so

1029
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:09,805
even without connection,

1030
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,855
if you place the stylus this way,
you'll hear the music.

1031
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:17,440
I'm so glad we came here. You're so cool.

1032
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,377
I have three turntables at home.

1033
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:24,422
For both decoration and actual use.

1034
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:26,965
Hearing this makes me want to place it.

1035
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,820
Can I listen first?

1036
00:51:28,845 --> 00:51:32,306
Because there's music
by Cigarettes After Sex.

1037
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,646
I love one of their songs.

1038
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:37,856
I think it's a famous song.

1039
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:40,177
- Is it "Apocalypse"?
- Something like that.

1040
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:42,596
- I...
- But there's not...

1041
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:45,863
I love their album with
the song "Cry" the most.

1042
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:49,558
I really love the lyrics.

1043
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,965
- Why? How so?
- The lyrics say that.

1044
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,614
"If you love me, I might make a cry."

1045
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:58,129
But actually the person who's saying this

1046
00:51:58,154 --> 00:52:01,114
is probably crying inside.

1047
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:04,225
I think I can relate to that.

1048
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,006
- Play it for me.
- "I'm not someone who"

1049
00:52:07,031 --> 00:52:10,794
"can love another person
with all my heart for a long time."

1050
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:13,458
"If we get together,
you will definitely cry."

1051
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:15,303
- Something like that.
- Goosebumps.

1052
00:52:15,328 --> 00:52:17,920
Those are the lyrics.
When I listen to this song, I feel

1053
00:52:17,945 --> 00:52:21,248
the person who's saying all this

1054
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:23,224
is probably crying inside even harder.

1055
00:52:23,249 --> 00:52:27,124
I think they're just fabricated words.

1056
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,230
It's nice to be here with someone
who knows how to use it.

1057
00:52:30,254 --> 00:52:34,378
If I come alone, I would
ask the staff for help.

1058
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:37,925
I'm hearing it.

1059
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:47,447
(The song that Hangyeol chose for Jinah)

1060
00:52:57,478 --> 00:53:02,353
(Hangyeol listens to the song with Jinah.)

1061
00:53:04,299 --> 00:53:07,750
The lyrics of the song called "Cry."

1062
00:53:07,775 --> 00:53:10,938
"There's something I
have to tell you first."

1063
00:53:10,963 --> 00:53:14,453
"If we get together,
you will definitely cry."

1064
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:17,447
When I heard the lyrics,
I sat and cried alone.

1065
00:53:17,472 --> 00:53:20,697
I wanted to tell her that
these were the things

1066
00:53:20,745 --> 00:53:23,760
that would help you understand me.
That was what I wanted to say.

1067
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,701
Well...

1068
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,795
I'm on the verge of tears.

1069
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:32,029
I'm like...

1070
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,607
Does it resonate with you?

1071
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,291
Yes, it's...

1072
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,478
First of all, the lyrics...

1073
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:42,494
The vocals.

1074
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,826
Yes, the vocals are persuasive.

1075
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:48,017
When they sing, "Cry,"

1076
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:51,584
it's... it's so you.

1077
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:54,359
When I listen to it late at night,
I always cry alone.

1078
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,850
The song you choose is so...

1079
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:02,452
(Their date continues.)
When I want to move.

1080
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:07,130
This part.

1081
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,051
(Smiling)

1082
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:18,307
When it comes to both her preferences
and music taste, I feel that,

1083
00:54:18,332 --> 00:54:21,870
"We have something in common."
Our stars have aligned.

1084
00:54:21,895 --> 00:54:23,332
That's what I do.

1085
00:54:23,379 --> 00:54:25,794
I and Ms. Hangyeol with sparkling eyes

1086
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:28,690
chose songs to listen
to together on our date.

1087
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:34,666
I chose songs based on their lyrics too.

1088
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:37,400
We've gone beyond
the point of just getting along.

1089
00:54:37,425 --> 00:54:40,862
The look in Hangyeol's eyes was very cool.

1090
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,807
Yes, I like this person.

1091
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,972
Both of us are crying

1092
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,769
listening to the song called "Cry"

1093
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:54,124
which we both chose.

1094
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,289
But it's okay. All
experiences are important.

1095
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,264
But I've been crying so
much I ran out of tears.

1096
00:55:02,545 --> 00:55:05,254
They always joke that,
"You act tough," right?

1097
00:55:05,279 --> 00:55:07,599
My act is "cheerfulness."

1098
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,787
Cheerfulness is your act?

1099
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:12,630
I'm never sad in front of other people.

1100
00:55:12,655 --> 00:55:15,436
But if you do that, you'll

1101
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:18,967
get only the positive energy back?

1102
00:55:18,992 --> 00:55:21,475
No, normally I'm not like that.

1103
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,531
But I'm like that after I got here.

1104
00:55:23,556 --> 00:55:25,296
- If you do that...
- So...

1105
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,907
If you suppress it like that, it will...

1106
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:29,351
push itself out ever more.

1107
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:33,381
I'm actually not the type
to like or hate someone,

1108
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:35,966
But there are people who are
compatible and incompatible with me.

1109
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,256
That's natural.

1110
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:39,929
I don't usually date...

1111
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:43,242
people who are incompatible with me.

1112
00:55:43,398 --> 00:55:44,859
I don't make efforts to.

1113
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:47,949
What I feel from living
in this world is that

1114
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:50,658
sometimes we talk
about compatibility, right?

1115
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:53,661
People like that are harder
to come by than we think.

1116
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:54,690
- So...
- Exactly.

1117
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:56,583
If we got a chance to have met one,

1118
00:55:56,608 --> 00:55:59,118
we shouldn't let them slip away easily.

1119
00:55:59,143 --> 00:56:01,099
I'm someone who...

1120
00:56:01,551 --> 00:56:03,552
Among the older women on this show,

1121
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:06,967
there's someone who's
the coolest of them all.

1122
00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:08,178
Heeyoung?

1123
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:10,754
- Oh, yes, yes.
- It's like...

1124
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:15,200
It would be great if that could happen.

1125
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:17,918
I want love like this and like that.

1126
00:56:17,943 --> 00:56:22,195
I think that is love.

1127
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:26,051
So I kept beating around the bush.

1128
00:56:26,076 --> 00:56:28,700
Like I wanted to arrange a fan meeting.

1129
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:30,346
But...

1130
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,395
I suddenly felt that way.

1131
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,009
You went through a period of time
where you were hurt and crying alone.

1132
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,269
You always had teary eyes.

1133
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:40,706
When I saw that,

1134
00:56:40,722 --> 00:56:42,394
it was me who couldn't bear it.

1135
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:44,925
It was me who couldn't watch anymore.

1136
00:56:45,262 --> 00:56:46,370
Because...

1137
00:56:47,019 --> 00:56:50,010
I wouldn't have let that happen

1138
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:51,128
if it were me.

1139
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:53,902
So I think sometimes

1140
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:56,035
the images we see on the outside

1141
00:56:56,224 --> 00:56:57,691
like age and...

1142
00:56:57,716 --> 00:56:59,605
being the leader in a relationship

1143
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:01,730
might not be the be-all end-all.

1144
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,628
So I want to...

1145
00:57:03,746 --> 00:57:06,455
I want to make you happy.

1146
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,737
I actually don't know
how to say things like that

1147
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:11,034
because I'm not someone who can

1148
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:14,120
give you a sense of stability
just by saying words.

1149
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,303
But even so,

1150
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,067
if you keep crying,

1151
00:57:19,092 --> 00:57:21,887
keep feeling hurt and keep being sad,

1152
00:57:21,912 --> 00:57:24,430
I don't want to let that happen.

1153
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,465
I don't think I want you to do that.

1154
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:30,144
But after I revealed my age...

1155
00:57:30,169 --> 00:57:32,605
I actually thought that
after I revealed my age,

1156
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,612
no one would give me a chance

1157
00:57:35,637 --> 00:57:38,136
and I started to give up.

1158
00:57:38,161 --> 00:57:41,440
But you called me last night,

1159
00:57:41,465 --> 00:57:45,252
which meant you gave me a chance.

1160
00:57:45,277 --> 00:57:47,630
So I wanted to try

1161
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,557
seizing that opportunity.

1162
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:57,604
When Hangyeol and I sat side by side,

1163
00:57:57,629 --> 00:58:02,213
I thought Hangyeol was very beautiful.

1164
00:58:02,238 --> 00:58:06,064
I never fell for someone
with long hair before.

1165
00:58:06,089 --> 00:58:09,027
She possesses both beauty and coolness.

1166
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,716
Her beauty is different from mine.

1167
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:14,255
It's like when we date a
woman for the first time.

1168
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,583
There's a possibility of new things
when we love women.

1169
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:22,233
For me, that moment was very magical.

1170
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,991
I actually wanted to tell her
I wanted her to be happy,

1171
00:58:28,145 --> 00:58:31,972
but I was afraid it wouldn't be
convincing if I had said it.

1172
00:58:31,997 --> 00:58:33,989
I tried to push

1173
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:36,419
and convince her to look at me

1174
00:58:36,564 --> 00:58:40,486
as a potential lover. Would that be wrong?

1175
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:46,517
(Both of them have comforted each other
in the midst of a complicated situation.)

1176
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,687
- I have a question.
- Yes?

1177
00:58:52,712 --> 00:58:55,587
When was the last time
you visited Jeju Island?

1178
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:57,641
July 2022.

1179
00:58:58,033 --> 00:58:59,915
- Why was the purpose?
- Pleasure.

1180
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:06,477
I walked this trail last spring.

1181
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,119
So you must be familiar.

1182
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,455
Yes, I love it here in Aewol.

1183
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,580
This place really has
the vibe of Jeju Island.

1184
00:59:13,596 --> 00:59:15,587
I love it here.

1185
00:59:16,268 --> 00:59:17,517
It's so beautiful here.

1186
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:21,041
(Getting to relax together.)
I want that plane in a pic.

1187
00:59:21,066 --> 00:59:23,548
(Outside the ToGetHer Houses)
I love taking pictures of planes.

1188
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:25,541
No special reason.

1189
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,486
You can see it clearly here.

1190
00:59:30,857 --> 00:59:35,684
(Capturing today's memories with photos)

1191
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,300
Maybe because I like
taking a trip to Jeju Island.

1192
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:42,230
I feel I want to kidnap Hangyeol

1193
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,192
and go to Jeju Island by ourselves.

1194
00:59:44,256 --> 00:59:45,794
That's how I feel.

1195
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:48,873
I'm very happy with Hangyeol right now.

1196
00:59:48,898 --> 00:59:50,225
When we get home,

1197
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,859
someone would think I'd stolen Hangyeol.

1198
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:59,340
I felt horrible having to go back.

1199
01:00:00,073 --> 01:00:01,315
Shall we go?

1200
01:00:01,386 --> 01:00:02,832
I'm hungry.

1201
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:08,841
Now I'm starting to feel like

1202
01:00:08,866 --> 01:00:12,310
I'm finally acclimated to Jeju Island.

1203
01:00:18,268 --> 01:00:20,636
I finally get to see you drive.

1204
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,550
When you went on a date
with someone else yesterday?

1205
01:00:23,575 --> 01:00:25,809
No, no, no.

1206
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,206
Very beautiful.

1207
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:28,690
Me?

1208
01:00:28,894 --> 01:00:30,026
(Getting goosebumps)

1209
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,525
I think today I...

1210
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,901
don't look too bad.

1211
01:00:35,073 --> 01:00:36,275
(Mirang and Dagyo's second date)

1212
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:40,502
I'm glad we get to create
more memories than others.

1213
01:00:42,877 --> 01:00:44,158
(And...)

1214
01:00:45,252 --> 01:00:46,483
This is awesome.

1215
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:47,623
Eh?

1216
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:49,991
(What shocks them both
on this double dating is...)

1217
01:00:50,016 --> 01:00:51,147
(Ring, ring)

1218
01:00:51,172 --> 01:00:53,082
- What are you doing?
- I'm frustrated.

1219
01:00:53,114 --> 01:00:54,129
Goodness.

1220
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:57,207
This is gonna be fun.

1221
01:00:57,427 --> 01:00:59,587
(We will reveal the sender
of one letter you received.)

1222
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:01,848
To be honest, I had high hopes.

1223
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:04,791
I want to know if it was Ms. Jinah.

1224
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:08,197
I low-key feel this is not fair.

1225
01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:15,978
(Who are the senders of the letters
they wonder about?)
