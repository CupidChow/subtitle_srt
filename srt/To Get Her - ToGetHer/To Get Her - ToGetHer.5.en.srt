1
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,840
- May I enter?
- Of course.

2
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,536
- Come on in.
- Okay.

3
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,193
I forgot my slippers, so I came for them.

4
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:45,864
- Don't mind the mess.
- Yes, it can't be helped.

5
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,627
I was still intimidated
by Ms. Hangyeol yesterday.

6
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,682
When she arrived, she
looked very beautiful.

7
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,530
She's basically everyone's type.

8
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:58,728
But her facial expression
was like, "So what?"

9
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:01,384
so I didn't think I could date her.

10
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,635
But when I saw Ms. Hangyeol
introduce herself softly,

11
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,164
I felt like we should be able to get along.

12
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,761
It was nice, so I wanted
to try talking to her again.

13
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:15,765
Earlier I had to leave,
so we didn't finish our conversation.

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,294
- What? The girlfriend thing?
- You cried earlier.

15
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,665
- Are you okay? You cried again just now.
- I'm okay now.

16
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:23,901
That's good.

17
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:26,822
But I'm getting more worried.

18
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,887
Why's that? I thought
it was handled well, no?

19
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:34,069
It's harder when things are unclear.

20
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:35,364
Oh, it's unclear.

21
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,606
Doing this is good. This I can understand.

22
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,268
As opposed to pretend like

23
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:42,005
- everything's good.
- Yes.

24
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,733
Do you want to know other people?

25
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,402
- Do you?
- Yes.

26
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,863
- Then go.
- Then go.

27
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:49,546
- Try it.
- I think it's good

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,649
because everyone likes you, Ms. Jinah.

29
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:54,590
- I agree.
- No. I do want to know Ms. Mirang

30
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,606
- but no feelings yet.
- You're just curious.

31
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:58,300
Up until this point...

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,291
What I'm curious about is
I feel that Ms. Mirang used to date

33
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,133
- someone like you.
- Yes.

34
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,726
If there's chance to go on a date

35
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:08,645
with Ms. Mirang,
I think the chemistry would be there.

36
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:12,401
Getting to be with someone
who can to hold us willingly,

37
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:16,684
- the chemistry would be very good.
- But it looks like she likes Ms. Dagyo.

38
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:20,511
About that, this is only Day 2.
Nothing has happened.

39
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:24,987
If someone shows interest,
I think it's worth a try.

40
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:28,884
- Like that.
- It's not like you're charging headlong.

41
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,952
- Really?
- Of course not.

42
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:32,528
Is her face your type?

43
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,756
I don't think so.

44
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,839
But without her face, she's my type.

45
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:39,535
- At first, she wasn't at all.
- I haven't seen that.

46
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:42,598
When I first saw Ms. Mirang, she stood out.

47
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:45,668
- Like a child.
- Ms. Mirang?

48
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:48,364
I just like being taken care of like that.

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,847
People who like being adored
usually feign indifference.

50
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,474
- Yes, acting strong.
- But that's me.

51
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:54,811
I'll act strong.

52
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,832
The person I'd like to
know better is Ms. Mirang.

53
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,499
She's probably like me.

54
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:04,899
This isn't how I want
to meet the person I like.

55
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:06,555
And there's also Dagyo.

56
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:11,326
So I don't wanna create a situation
that will cause confusion.

57
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:15,452
But my desire to get to know Ms. Hangyeol

58
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,720
is not as strong compared to Ms. Mirang.

59
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:20,721
But getting from zero
to here is also important.

60
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:24,617
- You're here?
- My gift to you.

61
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:26,148
- What's that?
- You can keep it.

62
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,844
No need. I'll buy it myself.

63
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,412
That's so touching.

64
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,593
- I should buy it myself.
- You wrote it, Ms. Jinah?

65
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:35,124
Yes, but I'd...

66
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:39,014
- written it and just got them.
- Do you mind signing it for me?

67
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:45,145
For me, the date on Day 3
is my way to learn new things.

68
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:49,410
For me, getting to know new people,
Ms. Hangyeol is perfect for that.

69
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:53,502
But if I ask Ms. Hangyeol
out on a date tomorrow,

70
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,359
my chance to get to know Ms. Mirang...

71
00:03:57,127 --> 00:04:00,016
would not be there anymore.

72
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,551
I'm about 90 percent confident.

73
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:04,642
Which path should I choose?

74
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:10,226
How many people do you
like now, Ms. Heeyoung?

75
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,650
- How many?
- Yes.

76
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,610
I normally don't fall for people.

77
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,433
So how many don't you fall for?

78
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,317
But the strange thing is

79
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,431
there's no one here I feel
uncomfortable with or dislike.

80
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:25,847
- I don't usually engage with people.
- I see.

81
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,930
But I never make the first move.

82
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:32,374
So the other person must make
the first move for you to like her.

83
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,471
(Nodding)

84
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:36,966
I went out on dates
and got yelled at for being oblivious.

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,043
I see. Well, you deserved that.

86
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,199
Why? What have you heard?

87
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,770
- I know everything.
- Really?

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,258
What did I do?

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,151
- You did something.
- I don't think so.

90
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,363
- You did.
- No, definitely not.

91
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,898
- You did. You did.
- No, I didn't.

92
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:03,826
- I didn't. No.
- You did.

93
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:07,709
I'm bad at guessing.

94
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,252
You're really oblivious.

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,996
Who?

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,998
I'll tell you when it's time.

97
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,640
This again.

98
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:21,616
But you usually engage...
Haven't you received a lot?

99
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,860
The second round of
letters, I didn't get any.

100
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,839
- The second round.
- The second round? Same.

101
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,405
I didn't get any letters.

102
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:30,913
Then we give and take.

103
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,381
- Thank you.
- Okay.

104
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,813
- You found out during a one-on-one talk?
- Um.

105
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:41,450
I was just next to them
and asked how many letters they got.

106
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,828
- Just asked in secret.
- Asked in secret like that.

107
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,203
So I must have been one of them.

108
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,334
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

109
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,931
- But now you don't know.
- Yeah..

110
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,896
Meaning not anymore.

111
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,359
(Smiling)

112
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:59,902
After talking, I feel we're similar.

113
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:03,372
We felt comfortable talking.
We should be able to be friends.

114
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,660
She probably feels the same.

115
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:08,110
It feels very much like
we're on this wavelength of friendship.

116
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,580
- Let's have some fruit.
- Fruit.

117
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:14,650
(Sneaking a glance)

118
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:18,187
(Seoyeon sensing Mirang and Dagyo)

119
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,737
- I can open it myself.
- Okay.

120
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:25,366
The redder the better.

121
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,369
I have makeup on.

122
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:28,657
- Really?
- Still red...

123
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:31,687
- Now I...
- Looks like you touched up your cheeks.

124
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,920
I tried to dim the color.

125
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:38,747
Well, it was very shocking

126
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:41,323
when I told everyone my age.

127
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,843
Everyone's probably disappointed
because now when I tell people my age,

128
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,858
- something like that happens.
- You don't look it at all.

129
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:51,233
So how old are you?

130
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,581
Thirty-...

131
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,028
- five.
- Five? Your current age?

132
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,851
- Four.
- 34.

133
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,913
Saying that makes it feel like a lot.

134
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:01,497
Are you gonna flee?

135
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:05,828
Just kidding. You look very young.

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,024
How long have you been on that job?

137
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:12,300
- Three years, maybe three.
- Three years?

138
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,732
Do you wear a white lab coat every day?

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,502
- How?
- I wear scrubs.

140
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,970
- I see.
- I take X-rays of patients.

141
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,892
- I see.
- I mostly.

142
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,650
You wear a work uniform.
You must look so cute.

143
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:33,842
Mirang knew that I like Dagyo.

144
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:39,104
Did she really need to come
in the kitchen and sit near me

145
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,664
in order to talk to Dagyo like that?

146
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,264
She knew how I felt,
but she still sat there

147
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,942
and have a conversation like that

148
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,093
despite knowing how I felt.
Did she really have to go that far?

149
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,008
She and I don't hate each other.

150
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,897
So was it necessary?

151
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,488
Or maybe she hates me.
I'm starting to wonder.

152
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,347
(Confused)

153
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,596
(A hair clip)

154
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,941
That's awesome.

155
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,951
You don't seem the type to use this stuff.

156
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:21,470
You seem straightforward.

157
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,195
- Not true.
- You're secretly girly.

158
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,636
- I use a lot of this stuff.
- Really?

159
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,178
How was your date today?

160
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,081
I chose based solely
on my first impression.

161
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,304
But it wasn't that bad.

162
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:40,609
But normally I prefer
someone older or my age.

163
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,405
- Yeah.?
- She seems young,

164
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,000
so I'm little disappointed.

165
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,330
But we'd just met.

166
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,519
How many people do you like?

167
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,990
Two.

168
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,970
You're clear about things.

169
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,433
Yes, I can only do one thing at a time.

170
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,802
Wish I had someone I
could be comfortable with.

171
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,991
But as you can see,

172
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,119
there're only chatty people there.

173
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,410
I'm not very good at talking.

174
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,907
- Yeah., me neither.
- Yes.

175
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:15,504
- But I look little arrogant.
- Yes.

176
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:18,560
I look little difficult to approach.

177
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,783
What are you like?

178
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,726
I'm not an easy person
who goes along with everything.

179
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:28,823
But I take good care of people I date.

180
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:31,293
- As a girlfriend?
- Of course.

181
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:37,065
I see that as a responsibility too.

182
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,410
Like when we keep pets.

183
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:47,836
If I go on dates, I won't
stay single for long.

184
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:50,085
But I stopped a while back.

185
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,327
- How many years?
- Two years for me.

186
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,058
- Six years for me.
- Eh?

187
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,647
I've been busy with work too.

188
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:02,911
- That doesn't help.
- Six years?

189
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,994
- I've been single for six years.
- Why's that?

190
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,886
Have you rejected everyone for six years?

191
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:12,133
Well, if I really like something...

192
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:15,077
- So you felt it was unnecessary?
- Yeah..

193
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,419
That's strange.

194
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:20,548
- May I ask what kind of person you like?
- Me?

195
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:24,232
I don't like someone
who acts like a princess.

196
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,848
But appearance doesn't matter.

197
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:28,183
But what about as friends?

198
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:29,927
I love it.

199
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,980
So not me I guess.

200
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,610
Actually I don't really
act like a princess.

201
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,422
But I guess it's not me.

202
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:44,006
- But you've been single for six years?
- Yeah..

203
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,309
I mean if I focus on something,

204
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:51,480
it's all I think about all day.

205
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,228
And I go all in.

206
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:55,544
At that time I was into writing,

207
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,722
so that was all I thought about all day.

208
00:10:57,892 --> 00:10:59,374
So that was all I did.

209
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,117
And if I have a girlfriend,
I only care about her.

210
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:04,866
I'm like that.

211
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,302
What if love and work
come at the same time?

212
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:11,567
I think I'm better at adapting now.

213
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,146
Back then it was out of my control.

214
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,921
But...

215
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,690
I don't know anyone's heart.

216
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:25,393
I don't know my heart either.

217
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,144
But you've been here for only
a few hours, to know that already

218
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,134
would've been weird.

219
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:37,049
The vibe around Ms. Seoyeon

220
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,107
is quite strong for me.

221
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:43,024
Her aura is something else.

222
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:51,393
(Heeyoung who'd thought so hard
she fell asleep in the living room)

223
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:07,670
(It's time to send your love letter.
(Please go to the heart room.)

224
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:12,358
I long for this opportunity.

225
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,831
Though it hasn't been
long, I've only met people

226
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,433
who told me they have feelings for me.

227
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:23,752
I guess it's my fault
for not realizing it myself

228
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,081
unless the other person says it clearly,

229
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:29,144
unless the other person tells me directly.

230
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,776
(Who will she send the letter to today?)

231
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,981
(Write to the person
you wanted to go on a date with.)

232
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:38,881
(You must write her name.)

233
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:46,802
Aha.

234
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:00,699
Wanted to go on a date with.

235
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:03,598
Wanted?

236
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:06,468
For today's question,

237
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,581
I thought they'd ask
who I was interested in,

238
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,020
so I was planning on
writing Ms. Riwon's name.

239
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,435
But it wasn't the question.

240
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:18,707
I think it's an "if" question,

241
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:22,204
so I ruled out those who had actually

242
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,870
gone on a date with me

243
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:26,353
and wrote without hesitation

244
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:29,204
because it was how I really felt.

245
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,126
My thinking was

246
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:33,969
I had to rule out the person
I'd already gone on a date with

247
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:36,191
and chose someone else.

248
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:41,595
(When I'm the most honest with my heart)

249
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:50,178
(Write each letter to convey sincerity)

250
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:57,755
(A love letter in which
weight has been added)

251
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:14,481
(Will the love letters touch their hearts?)

252
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,625
My question is

253
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:19,681
if someone I didn't expect
to be interested in me

254
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:21,343
suddenly invited me to go on a walk,

255
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:23,076
do you think I should go?

256
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,292
- Yes.
- Yeah.

257
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:25,897
- Would you go?
- First of all, yes.

258
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:29,164
But first, it would be suspicious. Why me?

259
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,659
Yes, because I would be curious.

260
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:33,682
- Can you decline an invite to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

261
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:37,272
I like that about you,
that's why I invite you.

262
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,449
Knowing this might spark an interest.

263
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:43,085
- What's to like?
- If it was me, I would ask, "Why?"

264
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,689
"Why?" if it's someone unexpected.

265
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:49,891
- "Why?"
- So if I

266
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:53,815
have the same doubt, I would go
and hear her out during our walk.

267
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:55,962
- But if...
- I could ask her then.

268
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,126
If you ask, "Why?"
and she says to give it a try?

269
00:14:58,363 --> 00:14:59,367
Um.

270
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,532
But now we've become closer

271
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,060
and gather like this,

272
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,676
the people we're interested in...

273
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:08,503
Eh? Something's up.

274
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:12,634
(The love letters have arrived.
(Please check your mailbox.)

275
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:13,696
Let's go.

276
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:16,518
(It's time to check on the love letters.)

277
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:17,563
Let's go.

278
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,307
(Kim Seoyeon)

279
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,359
I don't think I received any,

280
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:38,707
because I never have.

281
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:55,637
(One love letter to Seoyeon)

282
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,399
Seoyeon,

283
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,575
were you really being considerate?

284
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,947
- We can share a bed.
- Yes.

285
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,430
For me, Ms. Seoyeon

286
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,986
told me that she was being considerate.

287
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,734
But I saw the look in her eyes.

288
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:16,518
It was the look that says she looked at me
when I looked elsewhere, right?

289
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:20,935
So Ms. Seoyeon felt that
I wasn't interested in her at all.

290
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:24,253
But I'm someone who's not very forward.

291
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,161
I plan before I approach people.

292
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:29,756
So I acted like I wasn't interested
and I wrote her a letter.

293
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:06,079
Today is so crazy.

294
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,390
Today is...

295
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:14,022
What should I do today?

296
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,770
You know what the letter says?

297
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:19,260
She asked if I was really being
considerate. Something like that.

298
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:24,659
So how am I gonna sleep now?

299
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:26,898
Can I move to another room?

300
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:31,070
How am I gonna sleep? What do I do?

301
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,206
I won't be able to sleep now.

302
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:36,315
I was so sure she wasn't interested.

303
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:40,435
What should I do?

304
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,166
I'm not into someone who says they like me.

305
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:49,177
But I'm not sure if it's
because of this place.

306
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:53,728
When someone says they like me,
I'm excited and become interested.

307
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,483
I don't know. I'm going insane.

308
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:57,546
Huh?

309
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:00,207
I didn't know we'd reveal right away

310
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:01,730
so I wrote to Ms. Seoyeon.

311
00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:04,860
(Minwoo feeling shy for
having to share the bed)

312
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:06,307
What should I do?

313
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:13,868
To see her smile like
that over just one letter,

314
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:16,664
in the face of love, nothing else matters.

315
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:19,167
No matter how focused with work I am,

316
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,117
I really must have a girlfriend.

317
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:25,353
- You already checked?
- Yeah.

318
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:26,808
I couldn't make myself.

319
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:29,273
(Awkward) (Worried)

320
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,294
(Concerned)

321
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,497
Ms. Dagyo's facial expression confused me

322
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:38,653
so I think maybe she didn't write me.

323
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:40,781
Why so fast?
(Dagyo wrote 20 minutes ago.)

324
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:42,931
- What's up?
- What's wrong?

325
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:44,252
Why that face?

326
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:45,787
Why?

327
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,896
Well, it's nothing.

328
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:49,971
- I think I wrote well.
- Really?

329
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,767
I'm just thinking I wrote well.

330
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:57,585
Her expression said
it'd been quite difficult.

331
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:01,089
So I don't think Ms. Dagyo wrote me.

332
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,020
That's what I think.

333
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,398
(Has Mirang received any letters?)

334
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,834
Huh?

335
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:22,072
(Two love letters to Mirang)

336
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:25,781
(Who wrote the first one?)

337
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:30,469
To Mirang, the reason I want
to go on a date with you

338
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:32,787
and the reason that I can't

339
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:35,063
are both very clear to me,

340
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:37,390
so I'm very confused.

341
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,610
The reason I'm interested
in her is very clear.

342
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,899
Appearance-wise, she is my type.

343
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,141
It can't be helped.

344
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:53,235
(Who wrote the second letter?)

345
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,735
To Mirang, I wanted to go on a date
with you and I'm so glad I got to do it.

346
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:04,679
You wanted to go to a perfume shop
and I personally love fragrances,

347
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:06,162
so it was even more meaningful.

348
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,791
I want to know you better. Everything
we discussed today was very good.

349
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:19,395
One of the letters was probably

350
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,214
sent by Dagyo.

351
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:25,484
As for the other one,
I don't know who it is.

352
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:31,439
I went back and looked
at the first letter I got.

353
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:33,199
The handwriting is very similar.

354
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:36,938
I don't know who it is,
but if it's revealed later,

355
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:41,756
I'd probably feel different.

356
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:46,548
Right now the fact that
I like Ms. Dagyo, I'm sure

357
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:48,683
the others already knew. However,

358
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:50,535
now that I see

359
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:54,342
this person still expresses
the same feelings to me,

360
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:56,542
for me I really like it.

361
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,971
What?

362
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,936
(No love letters to Minwoo)

363
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,435
I expected to get zero point.

364
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:22,736
I figured that Ms. Hangyeol

365
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,406
shared my thought and ruled me out first.

366
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:28,095
And when Ms. Seoyeon
asked me about my type,

367
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,219
I said I didn't like someone
who acted like a princess.

368
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,242
Then she seemed a little deflated.

369
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:35,944
Women tend to be like this.

370
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,857
If we're not confident, we won't choose it.

371
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,877
So with my letter today,

372
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:46,968
I think she might change her mind
about her choice tomorrow.

373
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,404
I want to go slow.

374
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:54,095
- I don't want to check.
- Same. I'm scared.

375
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:56,738
But today's question can be
interpreted in many ways.

376
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:58,179
Yeah.
(Has Heeyoung received any?)

377
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:02,724
(No love letters to Heeyoung)

378
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:08,096
I get zero point again,
so I'm even more confused.

379
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,780
I think I'm more of a doer than a talker.

380
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:15,557
But nothing assures me right now.

381
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,350
I have no idea.

382
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:22,410
- Where should I check?
- I'm doing it here.

383
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:24,589
Where are you going?

384
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:27,321
Are you going upstairs?
I'm gonna check here.

385
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:33,015
(Kim Jinah)

386
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:36,995
(One love letter to Jinah)

387
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,549
To Jinah, thank you for speaking honestly.

388
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:43,851
Though I was a little late,

389
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,137
I listened to you carefully.

390
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:47,735
It was a very good time.

391
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:50,218
Thank you for choosing me as your date.

392
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,313
Let's get to know each other comfortably.

393
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,919
The part that says

394
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:57,618
"let's get to know each other comfortably"
is unclear again.

395
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,674
Does it mean getting comfortable
knowing each other?

396
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,283
Or feeling more comfortable? Which is it?

397
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:06,627
Does listening carefully
mean she understands?

398
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,788
Or she just listened
carefully? It's unclear.

399
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:15,827
I don't know if she's really sure.

400
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:19,167
And I wasn't being clear with her either.

401
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,519
But even if I tell her,

402
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,817
she wouldn't understand.
She would ask, "Why?"

403
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,213
What should I do?

404
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:31,530
(How many love letters has Dagyo received?)

405
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,369
(Three love letters to Dagyo)

406
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,322
To Dagyo,

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,060
it was so good to go out with you today.

408
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,640
I have no regrets.

409
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,806
I would like us to talk more.

410
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm very satisfied with the date today.

411
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:01,429
The person I want to know more,

412
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,345
the person I like,
there seems to be only Ms. Dagyo.

413
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,260
To Dagyo,

414
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,504
I wanted to go on a date
with you today, wah wah.

415
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,013
Next time let's go on date.

416
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:14,696
I want to go somewhere nice with Ms. Dagyo.

417
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,933
Somewhere romantic
with people there helping us.

418
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,476
I want to go somewhere like that.

419
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,619
To Ms. Dagyo,

420
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,521
I was glad to sit next to you.

421
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:28,396
I'd love to go on a date with you.

422
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,386
It's true. This morning

423
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:35,723
she was the one I thought
a date would be nice.

424
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:42,607
I have no idea who sent me
two of the three letters.

425
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:44,399
Today the people who sat next to me,

426
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,527
there were quite a few of them.

427
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:48,442
There really were.

428
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,810
(Her heart as complicated as the messages)

429
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,544
Heeyoung, did you check?

430
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:04,706
- Huh?
- Did you check?

431
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:05,789
Yeah.

432
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,999
Can I go to the next room?

433
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:09,938
Can I ask or I have to stay?
(Jinah changes the subject)

434
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,039
Don't know.

435
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:23,638
(Heeyoung leaves the house to think.)

436
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:28,656
I feel both thankful
and guilty with love letters.

437
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:31,893
I didn't want to make
her more upset by saying.

438
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,919
I feel guilty about not sending her
a letter, so I wanted to talk.

439
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:37,679
- Can we talk?
- Huh?

440
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,779
Can we talk?

441
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,145
Well,

442
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:48,196
I think on one side,
if people didn't go on dates today...

443
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:50,178
Didn't go on dates today?

444
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:51,979
People who haven't done that too.

445
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:54,627
I thought that was why
everyone said it was difficult.

446
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:58,612
People who haven't gone on a date,
who do they want to go on a date with?

447
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:00,088
That's what you thought?

448
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,356
Yes, and everyone said it was difficult.

449
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:06,167
So you can't say who you wrote?

450
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,387
It's not that. I don't
have a problem with that.

451
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:11,749
But, like, some people

452
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:13,550
have different ways

453
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:16,535
- of expressing feelings.
- Why are you whispering?

454
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:19,434
- Of expressing feelings.
- Yeah.

455
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:21,034
But...

456
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:24,638
- the way I express my feelings
- Yeah.

457
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,825
And Heeyoung's way are very different.

458
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,440
- "I listened to you carefully."
- Yeah.

459
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:31,490
"Thank you for choosing me."

460
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,681
And "let's get to know
each other comfortably."

461
00:26:33,683 --> 00:26:37,545
The word "comfortably"
has so many meanings.

462
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:38,574
But I'm...

463
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:43,297
wondering if she means to get comfortable
and not care what she says

464
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:45,866
or get to know each
other comfortably for real.

465
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,600
Her words are like...

466
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:53,788
The problem is I don't
feel like I'm actually

467
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:55,249
getting to know her.

468
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:01,152
The part that says today was very good
is also very unclear.

469
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,832
And the "get to know each other" part.

470
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,708
If you think it's good, it's good for real.

471
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,071
It's just different. It's not a bad thing.

472
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:12,836
Some people may think, "Since
I'm here, I'll get to know everyone."

473
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:15,223
But some people...
I don't think I'm the only one.

474
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:18,159
For me, even if she's not the right one,

475
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:21,848
I have to get to know her first.

476
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,565
I'm like that, so I want Heeyoung...

477
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:26,487
speak honestly.

478
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:28,142
You want her to be clear.

479
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,912
At least. But will she do that?

480
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:31,973
But...

481
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,795
She expresses herself in her own way.

482
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,343
I just don't understand.

483
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:39,340
She must feel uncomfortable too.

484
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,863
And who can we blame my frustration on?

485
00:27:42,222 --> 00:27:44,236
If you want to get to know other people,

486
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:46,554
just say you want to do that.

487
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,011
- Or...
- That's better.

488
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:50,265
- It is? It's clear, right?
- Yes, since we're here.

489
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:54,014
But I already said I wanted
to go on another date with her.

490
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:58,332
Because that's how to express feelings
without making her uncomfortable.

491
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:01,097
Because it's impossible to say,

492
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,558
"From now on, we should talk more."
That would be too selfish.

493
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:05,993
Did you get many today?

494
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:11,781
You know who wrote you today, right?

495
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:14,047
- The letter you got.
- The letter I got?

496
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:15,853
- It's from her.
- So?

497
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:17,198
That's why I'm confused.

498
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:21,289
Today's subject is someone
you wanted to go on a date with.

499
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,423
She sent me the letter,

500
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:25,239
so it's like there's already a conclusion.

501
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,483
If it's someone you wanted
but haven't gone on a date with,

502
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,024
then it shows interest.

503
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:34,437
If you send it to someone you already went out
with, it's like you do it for the sake of doing it.

504
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,110
For me, it's unclear.

505
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:38,652
Did you check?

506
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,281
How many?

507
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:42,029
- None.
- None?

508
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,397
Yeah, as usual.

509
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:51,292
For real.

510
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,480
(Heeyoung shares
her frustration with Seoyeon.)

511
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,823
And today's date?

512
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:59,580
We couldn't write to our date today.

513
00:29:00,217 --> 00:29:01,337
Of course we could.

514
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:02,876
No, we couldn't.

515
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:04,776
Yes, we could.

516
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:07,736
Wanting to go on another date.

517
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:09,683
I wrote that.

518
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:12,286
It's true that I already chose today.

519
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:15,309
Jinah said she wanted
to go on another date with me.

520
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,336
We'll be choosing soon, so I did this.

521
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,111
But I don't have date privileges anymore.

522
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,541
But when we like someone...

523
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:28,162
Right now I'm wonder if I'm...

524
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,002
so indifferent

525
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,773
that I don't feel pressured.

526
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:34,902
More importantly, I want
the other person to feel the same way.

527
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:40,488
So I want us to get to know
each other comfortably.

528
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,457
Today's situation doesn't help, does it?

529
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:46,292
No, this seems like a big issue now.

530
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,310
Yeah.

531
00:29:57,493 --> 00:29:59,039
Hello?

532
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,479
(Absent-minded)

533
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:04,752
Sleeping, weren't you?

534
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,741
At this point, I'm starting

535
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,937
- to feel like running away.
- You want to run away?

536
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:14,174
This thing went ahead.

537
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,839
Please take me out of this story.

538
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:22,957
I feel like an insignificant character.

539
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:26,048
But it's what happens

540
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,422
- in this place.
- Yes.

541
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:32,020
I think it's harder to meet
someone we like here.

542
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:33,173
That's what I think too.

543
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:38,086
There are tons of people out there
and it's hard to find someone.

544
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:40,181
To find someone out of eight people?

545
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:43,657
How is that possible?

546
00:30:44,013 --> 00:30:46,333
Otherwise I wouldn't have been
single for two years.

547
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,177
But what do you think
about today's question?

548
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,093
I think it's an "if" question.

549
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:55,489
I think it's an "if" question too.

550
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:58,459
No need to have any regrets.

551
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:02,336
Because today I chose you
because you're beautiful.

552
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:05,599
So don't be sad.

553
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,896
Well, thank you.

554
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:12,827
Why? I chose you because you're beautiful.

555
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,091
- When I'm here, I feel...
- Did you have to thank me?

556
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,420
Quite insecure.

557
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,430
Insecure? Everyone's insecure.
They just act confident.

558
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:25,840
You're very straightforward.

559
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:29,894
But it might be better to be able to cry.

560
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,900
- So why am I crying?
- Now?

561
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,376
Why am I crying? Wait.

562
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:37,858
Why am I crying?

563
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,827
- You can cry.
- Wait.

564
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:42,203
Why am I crying?

565
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,041
You can cry if you want to cry. But you...

566
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:49,317
I think I just want you

567
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:54,036
to apologize for things
you should be apologizing for.

568
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:55,156
That would be better.

569
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:57,418
It may not be something
you should apologize for,

570
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,464
but you feel that you should.

571
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:02,977
But if it's because you're young,

572
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:06,874
you may look at everything that way.

573
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,651
Or you may think that way
because of the unfamiliarity.

574
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:15,543
But from my point of view,

575
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,527
you're very charming.

576
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,943
You think differently.

577
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,063
You just have a different way of expressing

578
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,913
but it can be emotionally tiring.

579
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:28,322
I didn't think I would cry

580
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:31,192
in just two days.

581
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:32,973
Wanna find something to eat?

582
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:35,683
- Some carbs might improve your mood.
- Yes.

583
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:38,599
- Like curing a hangover.
- Let's cure a hangover.

584
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,710
- Ramyeon addicts.
- Where have you been?

585
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,136
- Huh? Our room.
- Your room?

586
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:46,899
We had to check our letters.

587
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:49,243
Probably too spicy for you.

588
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,891
I'm not eating.

589
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,542
Or you can try adding
some milk in the ramyeon.

590
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,424
- Huh?
- Is that ramyeon?

591
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:58,265
I can eat it like this.

592
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:02,042
After getting the letter, it seemed
Ms. Mirang's mood has improved.

593
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,553
It meant everyone knew
I'd written to Ms. Mirang.

594
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,851
The seat move was also telling
because she moved to sit next to me

595
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:13,274
and kept taking care of me.

596
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:16,103
As a result, those who have feelings for me

597
00:33:16,112 --> 00:33:19,680
or me wanting to get to know
someone else better may seem weird.

598
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,383
It's okay to do that when we're alone.

599
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:24,378
Or maybe do it secretly.

600
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:26,100
This is just the beginning.

601
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,350
Isn't it too much to do this
in front of a lot of people?

602
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,541
I felt a little uncomfortable.

603
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:33,927
It was a little uncomfortable.

604
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,719
If it was just the two of us,

605
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:38,746
that would be better.

606
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:41,401
- Why are you turning away?
- Huh?

607
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,776
I had my eyes closed.

608
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:45,048
- Are you sleepy?
- Yeah. For a sec.

609
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:48,246
After our date,

610
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:50,991
I thought Ms. Dagyo would be more obvious,

611
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:53,454
but she does everything the same way.

612
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,663
Or am I being too much? That's my thinking.

613
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:01,311
(The night of confusion
and not knowing each other's thoughts)

614
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,293
Would be nice if you open the gift.

615
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,357
I love it. You would love it too.
(Mirang offers Minwoo masks and a toner.)

616
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:14,703
(Full) (Tight)

617
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:24,699
(This side too)

618
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:35,193
(Moist and neat night skin care)

619
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,069
I'm so happy.

620
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:46,027
(Room 1 guests are preparing for bed.)

621
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,151
(Dagyo is showering.)

622
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,147
(Heeyoung approaching Jinah)

623
00:34:52,677 --> 00:34:54,748
So there's another person beside me?

624
00:34:56,883 --> 00:35:00,714
You know I misunderstood
the letter's subject.

625
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,144
I thought I was to rule out
those I've gone out with.

626
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:06,926
So who?

627
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,282
What if I say who

628
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:11,625
- and you feel bad?
- But...

629
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,034
- It's weirder not knowing.
- Really? About that...

630
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:18,455
Never mind.

631
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:22,656
No, no, it's not that
I don't want to talk about it.

632
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:25,645
Like...

633
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:31,123
I don't have two people in mind.

634
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:35,259
I'm not saying it's between
you and this person.

635
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:37,845
Not between you and the other person.

636
00:35:37,873 --> 00:35:40,502
That's not my intention.

637
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:46,086
It's very dark.

638
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,789
But just now you...

639
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:51,819
We're having a serious talk.

640
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:54,346
I didn't mean it that way about you.

641
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,958
(It wasn't long, but we
got to speak honestly.)

642
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:02,396
I have to do this for skincare.
It calms the skin.

643
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:04,885
We need calmness.

644
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:08,115
There's a lot in one pack.

645
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:20,032
Do we have to wake up at 8.30?

646
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,844
Yes, 8.30. I have a serious
sore throat right now.

647
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:25,632
I'll sleep outside.

648
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,454
- My coughs would disturb you.
- Really?

649
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:30,090
I feel like I'll cough a lot.

650
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,838
You won't.

651
00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:33,340
I'll turn on the heater to sleep.

652
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:37,458
(Jinah goes outside.)

653
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:41,508
What if Jinah

654
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:44,464
targets only you?

655
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,966
Would you be okay with that?

656
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:47,988
That's what I'm wondering.

657
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,110
I'm wondering how you feel.

658
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,305
(Heeyoung pondering)

659
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:55,469
She wouldn't be overthinking, right?

660
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,973
Sometimes she's just curious

661
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,807
and wants to know this person

662
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,730
so she wants to go on a date with her.

663
00:37:02,868 --> 00:37:03,951
It's possible.

664
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:05,662
That's the point.

665
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:10,037
If both of us go out with other people,
this will be resolved.

666
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:14,660
But why would I go on a date
with someone who's not interested in me?

667
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:18,812
You have to think that
other people are interested.

668
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,190
No one else's interested in me.

669
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:23,308
(Uncomfortable)

670
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:27,234
There are a lot of people here.
Someone must be.

671
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:30,492
May be someone who hasn't told you.

672
00:37:30,638 --> 00:37:31,672
I said there wasn't.

673
00:37:31,703 --> 00:37:34,120
How can you be so sure?

674
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:36,829
I said there wasn't. There really isn't.

675
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,833
Why do you keep thinking that?

676
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,531
Why do you think that?

677
00:37:42,558 --> 00:37:43,670
Why are you so sure?

678
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,281
There may be someone
who hasn't expressed their interest.

679
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,523
I really don't know.

680
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,026
I always thought
I'd want to on a date with her once.

681
00:37:53,214 --> 00:37:56,069
I've been interested in
Ms. Heeyoung from the beginning.

682
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,565
But that idea doesn't seem
to have crossed her mind

683
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:02,242
I think I've shown my interest.

684
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,452
Has she even noticed?

685
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,695
Does she know or not?

686
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,298
I want to try going out with Ms. Heeyoung.

687
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:16,019
(The relationships get more complicated.
(Where will their hearts land?)

688
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:47,968
I have to use a mask tonight.
You didn't use a mask last night, right?

689
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:50,517
Let's do it together today.

690
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:54,266
- I'm gonna wear this.
- What?

691
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:57,723
What am I seeing?

692
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,700
Won't it be like "Single's Inferno"?

693
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,484
- What are you talking about?
- Just look.

694
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,461
There's a sexy lady on the shirt.

695
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:11,058
What if during a date the other person
doesn't look at you but looks at her instead?

696
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:12,457
Would that happen?

697
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:15,739
Well, she's drawing too much attention.

698
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:18,518
What?

699
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:21,388
- It's terrifying.
- How is it terrifying?

700
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:25,138
You have to come alone.
How can you bring another woman?

701
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:28,455
- You'll just show your dark side.
- Why?

702
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,661
- Why? It's pretty.
- This one

703
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:32,679
keeps staring at me.
(grabbing)

704
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:33,771
This person.

705
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,856
I don't have to wear it.

706
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,299
(The two people who express their feelings
more clearly than they did the night before)

707
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,197
- It's so cool.
- Okay, okay.

708
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,393
- I don't see the harm.
- Hey.

709
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:48,104
Just like that?

710
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:49,416
It's mine.

711
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:54,173
I feel...

712
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:56,463
more comfortable to the point

713
00:39:56,483 --> 00:40:00,026
I think we should get to
know each other for real.

714
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:04,769
(Dagyo looks after her skin
early in the morning.)

715
00:40:13,103 --> 00:40:15,044
Very moist.

716
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,000
That's better.

717
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:22,111
(The toner rich with nutrients)

718
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:24,205
No need to do anything more.

719
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,046
So moist it got in the eyes?

720
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:29,683
Yeah, it's awesome.

721
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,201
I think I can rub it all over my body.

722
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:36,296
Looks like it.

723
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,150
If there's this much.

724
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,087
Maybe on my legs too.

725
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,557
It's still early.
(Too much for just the face)

726
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,534
(Using it all)

727
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,525
I don't know what to do today.

728
00:40:58,274 --> 00:41:00,120
(Getting up)

729
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:05,226
(Swollen)

730
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,130
(ToGetHer Houses with morning chaos)

731
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,553
- But...
- Huh?

732
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,200
It's really good. Try it.

733
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,159
I used it before makeup.

734
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,548
It was very easy to apply makeup.

735
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,629
- See?
- Yeah.

736
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:38,265
They're sheets but not very translucent.

737
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:39,586
It's like an essence.

738
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:41,161
It's very rich.

739
00:41:41,493 --> 00:41:42,513
Whoa, this is...

740
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:44,471
- May I?
- How did you open it?

741
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,267
Rotate and pull.

742
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,481
- You're strong.
- Yeah.

743
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,604
- It's dry here. Use it.
- Very thin.

744
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,260
And the makeup will set very well.

745
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,809
One sheet is enough. No need to use two.

746
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,072
- Place it on the cheek?
- Yeah.

747
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,489
Be careful because it's...

748
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:11,808
very moist.

749
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:16,703
There's so much of it
you can rub it on your entire body.

750
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,779
- It keeps dropping.
- I'm not kidding.

751
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:20,979
I even rubbed it on my legs.

752
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,209
(Moist)

753
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,119
Apply it on your face first.
And leave it for a moment.

754
00:42:26,768 --> 00:42:28,000
Then rub it with your hands.

755
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,061
- The makeup will stick.
- Really?

756
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,341
- Before makeup?
- Yeah.

757
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:34,328
I used one sheet for my face and neck.

758
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:36,763
- The neck too.
- Just one sheet?

759
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:38,553
Feels so much more moisturized.

760
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:40,095
My skin's very dry.

761
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,499
Now your face looks very small.

762
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,402
(Feeling good)

763
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:46,860
One sheet can cover the whole cheek.

764
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:48,726
The whole cheek.

765
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:51,965
Really.

766
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:53,835
Don't make me laugh.

767
00:42:56,337 --> 00:43:00,163
(Mirang brings something
to House 1 early in the morning)

768
00:43:07,948 --> 00:43:10,237
- Hello?
- Who's there?

769
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,125
Why are you here?

770
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,768
Just came by for a visit.

771
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:17,357
Yeah. You never came. Why are you...

772
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,132
Oh.

773
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:21,448
It's Ms. Mirang.

774
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:23,703
A perfume? Really?

775
00:43:23,724 --> 00:43:26,780
- Put this on before you leave.
- Why?

776
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,519
- I haven't put on any perfume.
- That's why.

777
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:32,592
I was worried you would,
so I came by early with it.

778
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:35,622
- What's that?
- The perfume we made yesterday.

779
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,631
Ta-da.

780
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,473
Please put it on.

781
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:43,483
I have 10 minutes left. I have to go.

782
00:43:43,493 --> 00:43:45,672
- See you in 10 minutes.
- Yes.

783
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,536
- Why did she write? I'm so curious.
- Put it on.

784
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,227
(The memory from the first date
of Mirang and Dagyo)

785
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,762
Cheonjoohanbok?

786
00:43:56,308 --> 00:43:57,874
- What's this?
- Let me see.

787
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,139
What does that mean?

788
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,294
I have to ask what "Cheonjoohanbok" mean.

789
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:03,389
What is "Cheonjoohanbok"?

790
00:44:05,536 --> 00:44:06,967
I got a perfume.

791
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,457
From who?

792
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,625
The perfume I made
with Ms. Dagyo yesterday.

793
00:44:12,756 --> 00:44:14,915
We didn't exchange them yesterday.

794
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:18,291
(Satisfied)

795
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:20,096
Is it good?

796
00:44:20,163 --> 00:44:21,995
There's a message.

797
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,256
What does it say?

798
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,345
"First date, snow day."

799
00:44:28,763 --> 00:44:30,570
Very romantic.

800
00:44:31,196 --> 00:44:33,767
But mentioning the first date
should be memorable.

801
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:37,051
(Sniffing)

802
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:38,387
Oh, it smells nice.

803
00:44:39,456 --> 00:44:40,980
Want to smell?

804
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:42,725
Never mind.

805
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:44,997
Never mind.

806
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,209
I'll put it here.

807
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:52,412
(The memory with Dagyo
is kept safely on the side of the bed.)

808
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,765
(Dagyo also ends with
the perfume she made with Mirang.)

809
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,970
(The third morning at the ToGetHer Houses
starting with chaos)

810
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:10,931
- Today.
- Oh.

811
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:12,729
- Here.
- What's that?

812
00:45:14,408 --> 00:45:16,114
(What is this)

813
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:24,972
(Special gifts arriving
at the ToGetHer House)

814
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:28,902
Iced chocolate.

815
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:30,561
(What's that?)

816
00:45:33,073 --> 00:45:34,547
It's here.

817
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,851
This should be an Americano.

818
00:45:39,826 --> 00:45:40,886
Americano.

819
00:45:43,144 --> 00:45:46,206
Oh, you didn't make a sound.

820
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,793
What's that?

821
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,457
Those who come first...

822
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,552
get to choose.

823
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:53,820
Great,

824
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,057
- This one is hot.
- Thank you.

825
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,900
(Mm.)

826
00:46:01,148 --> 00:46:02,288
Oh, delicious.

827
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:08,435
Mm, delicious.

828
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,500
Feels like I'm drinking
ToGetHer-scented water.

829
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,909
- Smell it.
- ToGetHer-scented water?

830
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:17,817
- Yes.
- Oh, I can smell it.

831
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:19,778
- Sounds yummy.
- Probably.

832
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,941
The scent that's placed
in every room, right?

833
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:30,827
- Very good.
- Right?

834
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:33,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

835
00:46:33,606 --> 00:46:34,613
Hello.

836
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:36,803
- Hello.
- Hello.

837
00:46:36,805 --> 00:46:37,820
Hello.

838
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,045
My favorite color.

839
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:45,240
Hello.

840
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:47,842
The gifts arrived.

841
00:46:47,896 --> 00:46:48,896
(What's that?)

842
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:50,659
It says, "Enjoy."

843
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,336
The gifts from someone to everyone
in the ToGetHer Houses.

844
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:54,674
- Enjoy.
- Yes.

845
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,850
Let's believe the note.

846
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Cheers.

847
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:04,200
Oh, let's say thanks first.

848
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:05,728
Thank you.

849
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,580
(Starting the day with delicious coffee)

850
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,397
Today we have to choose

851
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,644
- two people.
- That's right.

852
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,859
Should we draw lots?

853
00:47:20,147 --> 00:47:22,515
What to do? Should we use the pirate?

854
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,858
- Good.
- It's quick.

855
00:47:24,953 --> 00:47:26,659
- Do it quickly.
- Focus on speed.

856
00:47:26,686 --> 00:47:28,606
(Drawing lots for tonight using the pirate)
Here.

857
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,423
(Hangyeol first)
Two people from yesterday first.

858
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:32,849
- Please choose your side.
- Choose your side.

859
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,080
- Which way?
- This way.

860
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:35,108
Okay.

861
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,624
- Anyway...
- From Ms. Mirang.

862
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:39,586
- This way?
- Looks like she approves.

863
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,130
(Hangyeol first)
I'll go here instead.

864
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:46,179
- What's that?
- You're not the first.

865
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,305
(Hangyeol's passed.)

866
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:49,075
(The second one is Mirang.)

867
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:53,512
He won't pop.
(Mirang's easily passed.)

868
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,833
- What?!
- What?!

869
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:59,125
- What?!
- What?!

870
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:00,479
Like this.
(Chosen to make dinner)

871
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,495
(Speechless)
Let's have yummy food.

872
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,572
I thought it wouldn't be me
so I stabbed it with confidence.

873
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:08,381
I'm afraid.
(The game continues.)

874
00:48:09,091 --> 00:48:10,131
(Dagyo's passed.)

875
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,824
(Seoyeon's passed.)
Cute.

876
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:14,996
(Jinah's turn.)
You startled me.

877
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:17,527
(Hoping)

878
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:20,467
I have to survive.

879
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:23,557
(Jinah's passed too.)
(Noticing)

880
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:25,942
(Bummed)

881
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:31,144
(Click)

882
00:48:31,605 --> 00:48:32,968
This takes a while.

883
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,744
(Pirates seem to not come out)

884
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,925
(Hangyeol's passed easily.)

885
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,814
I can feel it's gonna be me.

886
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,019
It's gonna be me.

887
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,634
(Mirang's chosen to make dinner.)

888
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:51,379
It's gonna be me.

889
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:59,282
- Wait.
- You were suggesting soybean paste stew.

890
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,288
- Dang it.
- I mean you should make it.

891
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:04,297
- Great.
- I'll make something else.

892
00:49:04,332 --> 00:49:05,545
I thought about it this morning.

893
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:07,574
- If I make that, who's gonna
- Great.

894
00:49:07,608 --> 00:49:08,911
- Make something else?
- Great.

895
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,898
Please do your best.

896
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,749
(Today's dinner seems to be promising.)

897
00:49:16,126 --> 00:49:18,886
But my eyes this the morning

898
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,487
looked like an owl's eyes.

899
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,490
The most swollen I've ever seen.

900
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,427
There are those sheets recommended
to me this morning. Try them.

901
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:29,762
Really? They reduce swelling?

902
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:32,345
When I woke up, my face was very dry.

903
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:37,636
(For today's date, please text
the name of who you want in 5 minutes)

904
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,205
Five minutes?

905
00:49:39,653 --> 00:49:40,695
Five minutes?

906
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,059
Why do we have to choose so quickly today?

907
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:50,590
I texted without hesitation right away.

908
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,959
I texted Jinah's name.

909
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:55,695
(Pondering)

910
00:49:56,147 --> 00:49:57,147
(Noticing)

911
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:02,468
- I'm gonna go to my room.
- I'm gonna think in my room.

912
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,230
Am I the only one who already texted?

913
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,251
I wanted to go out with
Dagyo, so texted her name.

914
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:15,768
- Did you text?
- No, I'm still hanging my coat here.

915
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:22,342
- I dreamed the same thing.
- Yeah?

916
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,878
- No point in worrying about this.
- I don't feel lucky.

917
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,360
We have to choose the person
we want to go out with first.

918
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:33,586
- What if we don't match?
- What then?

919
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,829
- We'll probably have to stay here.
- Really?

920
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,345
So it's not bad.

921
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,120
- I agree.
- Flirting in the house is not bad.

922
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,524
Since we were asked to pick the person we wanted
to go on a date with, so I texted her name.

923
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:49,225
I picked Ms. Hangyeol.

924
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:53,106
I chose Ms. Jinah.

925
00:50:53,193 --> 00:50:55,575
I chose this person to go on a date with

926
00:50:55,706 --> 00:50:58,698
not because of romantic interest,
but because I want to know her.

927
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,772
Has any of us texted?

928
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:02,774
(Texting)

929
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:05,336
Has anyone texted?

930
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:06,779
- Did you text?
- Just did.

931
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,495
You did? So you're preparing in the room.

932
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,978
I don't think my hair looks good today.

933
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:14,067
- I should rest at home.
- Did you text?

934
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,661
(Nodding)
Really?

935
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:17,656
Everyone texted.

936
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,592
Should we stay home?

937
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:22,659
- What if I have to stay?
- I'm preparing myself for a no.

938
00:51:22,786 --> 00:51:25,191
- I've been there.
- How was it?

939
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:26,980
- It was...
- Fun, right?

940
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,801
- It wasn't bad.
- Was it like this?

941
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,723
Like us having a conversation?

942
00:51:30,749 --> 00:51:33,696
- Okay.
- Just people with no dates gathering.

943
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,508
- Was it like that?
- It was...

944
00:51:35,536 --> 00:51:37,835
Even without a date,
there's a lot of fun stuff.

945
00:51:37,852 --> 00:51:39,110
What were you putting on?

946
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:40,896
- You can still have fun.
- Give me a fixer.

947
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:43,229
I keep wanting to use her stuff.

948
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,698
Maybe I shouldn't tie my hair like this.

949
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:49,295
- A half-up?
- Yeah. I shouldn't, right?

950
00:51:49,383 --> 00:51:50,422
It's fine.

951
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:51,476
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

952
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,107
My face might look too round.
(Dagyo looks at them, pondering.)

953
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,314
It looks neat.

954
00:51:55,496 --> 00:51:57,355
Maybe I should change my outfit.

955
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:58,417
(Pondering)

956
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,488
After pondering,

957
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:04,864
I chose Heeyoung.

958
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:08,080
I would definitely regret it
if I don't get to know her.

959
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,871
In my dream last night,

960
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,807
- Your dream?
- I dreamt of Ms. Dagyo.

961
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:16,696
- Yeah?
- But Ms. Dagyo...

962
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:19,919
I don't remember much,
but the person looked like her.

963
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,782
She was gonna break a promise
to me. Like an appointment.

964
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,506
- In my dream, we had a big fight.
- Yeah?

965
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:29,334
But after I woke up,
I still thought about it.

966
00:52:29,406 --> 00:52:32,145
But now that we live here,

967
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:34,727
there are bound to be arguments.

968
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:38,166
Two hearts are not aligned.

969
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:40,399
Something like that is bound to happen.

970
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,736
I don't know if it's because of this dream

971
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:46,886
that I'm even more focused on her now.

972
00:52:47,386 --> 00:52:48,835
- Really?
- Yeah.

973
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:52,888
(Ms. Hangyeol, the car's ready.)

974
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,980
I get a date?

975
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:55,708
It says you have to go.

976
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:56,800
Me?

977
00:52:56,856 --> 00:52:58,104
You got someone?
(Ms. Minwoo, the car's ready.)

978
00:52:58,106 --> 00:52:59,439
Still don't know what this is.

979
00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:00,927
I'm gonna go.

980
00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:02,849
(Ms. Jinah, the car's ready.)

981
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,497
Eh? Huh?

982
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:07,132
Good luck.

983
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,509
What's this? Why?

984
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:13,385
Have fun.

985
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,630
Oh, I see.

986
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,436
Please don't misunderstand.

987
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:21,234
- It's probably because of you.
- How?

988
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:24,576
I think it's definitely because of you.

989
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:26,238
How?

990
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,035
What do you mean?
Why are you going because of me?

991
00:53:29,852 --> 00:53:33,372
Am I going because
your choice matches someone else's?

992
00:53:34,248 --> 00:53:37,557
- It's because yours matches someone else's.
- I chose you, dummy.

993
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,576
Really.

994
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:46,023
I think so.

995
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:49,572
I texted your name.

996
00:53:49,787 --> 00:53:52,345
- Bye, I'm off!
- Why?

997
00:53:53,153 --> 00:53:54,814
Me? I'm told to go on a date.

998
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:56,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

999
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:59,006
Now? Already?
(Heeyoung is shocked.)

1000
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:00,026
No idea.

1001
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,506
- Really?
- Yeah.

1002
00:54:02,726 --> 00:54:04,423
When Jinah went out,

1003
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,079
she blamed me on her way out

1004
00:54:06,085 --> 00:54:09,191
that because of me, she had to
go on a date with someone else.

1005
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:11,761
But I didn't understand what she said

1006
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:16,963
because I chose Ms.
Jinah, so I'm very confused.

1007
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:20,437
(Jinah leaves the
ToGetHer House by herself.)

1008
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:26,644
Who's Jinah going out with?

1009
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,494
- Yeah.
- I'm curious.

1010
00:54:28,508 --> 00:54:30,449
I don't understand at all.

1011
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:32,885
I don't understand
what she said before she left.

1012
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:35,935
You chose Jinah?

1013
00:54:36,337 --> 00:54:37,337
(Nodding)

1014
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,187
You chose Jinah?

1015
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,936
You texted the only
name you were sure about.

1016
00:54:44,235 --> 00:54:47,627
Yes, but now it turns out like this.

1017
00:54:48,848 --> 00:54:51,170
But she said she'd texted my name.

1018
00:54:51,425 --> 00:54:52,472
Today just now?

1019
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,514
Yeah. What should I do?

1020
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:57,690
Or did she think I hadn't texted her name?

1021
00:54:58,318 --> 00:54:59,869
Or was she lying?

1022
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,914
Is it something like that?

1023
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:03,936
- She said she'd texted your name?
- Yeah.

1024
00:55:04,842 --> 00:55:06,143
Then why is she with someone else?

1025
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:08,221
Well, she said, "Oh, I see."

1026
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:10,196
She said she was going out because of me.

1027
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:11,517
What did she mean?

1028
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,800
She went out because she thought
I texted someone else's name.

1029
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:16,395
Huh? What the heck?

1030
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:19,982
Yeah.
(Having to go on a confusing date)

1031
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,400
What the heck?

1032
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:23,976
Did you text Mirang's name?

1033
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,825
- Mirang?
- Yeah.

1034
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,413
- No.
- Huh?

1035
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:30,710
I didn't text her name.

1036
00:55:33,446 --> 00:55:34,547
Why not?

1037
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:37,999
Who then?

1038
00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:39,378
Who did you choose?

1039
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,020
How can I tell you?

1040
00:55:41,442 --> 00:55:42,442
(Staring)

1041
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,352
I really don't know.

1042
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:49,922
I don't really know. Dang it.

1043
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,684
It's not as easy as I thought.

1044
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,549
(Ms. Seoyeon, the car's ready.)

1045
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:56,195
- You're going out?
- Yes.

1046
00:55:58,026 --> 00:55:59,786
I must be the only one not going out.

1047
00:56:01,682 --> 00:56:03,191
(Ms. Mirang, the car's ready.)

1048
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,835
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

1049
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,500
(Ms. Dagyo, the car's ready.)
Good luck.

1050
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,741
- Have fun.
- Who am I going out with?

1051
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:18,173
The person you chose, of course.

1052
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,685
With the person I chose?

1053
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:22,926
The choices must match to get a date.

1054
00:56:23,277 --> 00:56:24,764
I don't think so.

1055
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:29,654
What's wrong with everyone?

1056
00:56:32,873 --> 00:56:36,945
(In the end, what kind of dates
are waiting for them?)

1057
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,944
(Minwoo's preparing for a date.)

1058
00:56:43,063 --> 00:56:44,063
(Smiling)

1059
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,439
Come on. Check me.

1060
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:47,886
Check your face.

1061
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:51,437
Should I put them on or not?

1062
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,717
But what is this white thingy?

1063
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:55,354
- It will dry.
- Dry?

1064
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:56,545
(Curious)

1065
00:56:57,124 --> 00:56:58,484
Put them on.

1066
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:02,527
That's what I wanted to hear, so I asked.

1067
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,250
- It's crazy.
- Okay.

1068
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:06,100
(Mirang gives a sensible answer.)

1069
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,012
(Dagyo's preparing for a date.)

1070
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:11,756
(Choosing earrings)

1071
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:16,018
(Hesitant)

1072
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:17,103
Which pair?

1073
00:57:19,266 --> 00:57:24,077
- Hey, which one should I wear?
- Let's see. I like this one. This one.

1074
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,625
This one and this one.

1075
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:29,368
- This one.
- This one.

1076
00:57:30,952 --> 00:57:32,392
They look different when they're on.

1077
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,760
(Successfully preparing for a date
thanks to their help)
