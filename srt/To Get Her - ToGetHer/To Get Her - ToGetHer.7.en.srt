1
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:35,921
(ToGetHer House 2)

2
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,892
Are you interested in anyone right now?

3
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,277
Have you written anyone?

4
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,324
Has anyone replied?

5
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:46,504
Sit down.

6
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:51,109
Replied?

7
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,165
I didn't get a reply.

8
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:54,415
Nothing?

9
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,170
Yes, I kept writing.

10
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:57,809
A reply...

11
00:00:57,944 --> 00:00:59,306
Because it's to Heeyoung.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,686
Oh, I also...

13
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:07,295
I thought I'd write in the way
that let her know who was writing her.

14
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:08,817
- Really?
- Yes, I wrote

15
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:11,131
exactly what I'd said that day.

16
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,762
Riwon?

17
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:14,825
No.

18
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,411
- No?
- No.

19
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,505
My sense is horrible.

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,434
So I'm gonna write someone else next time.

21
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,220
Why?

22
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:25,225
Because she hasn't replied?

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,389
Because there hasn't been...

24
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,749
- She didn't reply?
- There hasn't been an encounter.

25
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,894
The person you wrote today,

26
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:37,440
is she the same person you've been writing?

27
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,824
- No, she's not.
- A different person?

28
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:44,480
I'd gotten so lost to the point that
I felt, "Is this the best I can do?"

29
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,683
So I feel that I'm...

30
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,088
too inexperienced.

31
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:54,213
Even more than I thought.

32
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,490
I just feel in pain and tired.

33
00:01:57,724 --> 00:02:01,990
I can't get cocky and think, "I can do it."

34
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:05,146
I'm regretting it right now.

35
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:07,291
I knew I was gonna regret it

36
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,423
but I still did things
that would make me regret it.

37
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:14,146
Basically, that's how I feel.

38
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,669
But I don't regret trying my best.

39
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:20,795
Yes.

40
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:22,998
Yes.

41
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,475
You regret coming here?

42
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:28,185
Me?

43
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,509
- Yes.
- Why?

44
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,235
I'm gonna decline.

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,556
(Dagyo, Mirang and Minwoo arrive at House 2.)

46
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,178
I bought this.

47
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,251
What?

48
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:43,056
Jeju makgeolli.

49
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,391
We divided it in half.

50
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,398
- Added olive oil.
- Are you really gonna rate it?

51
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:50,891
Seriously?

52
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:52,266
Let's go to my room.

53
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:58,478
Why do they...

54
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:01,603
- Why do they always leave when we show up?
- Enjoy your date.

55
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:06,246
(Doesn't know how to act)

56
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,332
Is it not too hot?

57
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:10,465
It's okay.

58
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,014
If this continues, I would be even weirder.

59
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,211
That's what I think.

60
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,008
It's endless.

61
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,935
So when you open up about this,

62
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,646
if we do that too much...

63
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:34,614
I try not to confide in anyone too much.

64
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,810
If there's nothing or no one to vent to,

65
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:43,514
it'd be difficult to endure this place.

66
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:47,679
How do you express yourself
when you feel uncomfortable?

67
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:50,696
Sometimes I talk to my roommates.

68
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,298
Just vent.

69
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,868
Wait a sec.

70
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,433
I always cry.

71
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:10,807
I feel guilty, worried that they will...

72
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:13,308
- blame me.
- Who would say such a thing?

73
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,691
No one.

74
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,941
Actually, the age of the people who are here

75
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:21,466
has gone way beyond my expectations.

76
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,822
The age difference makes me feel like
everyone has to babysit me like their kid.

77
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:30,339
I didn't expect to find no one close to my age.

78
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:33,535
So it's...

79
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:36,254
But...

80
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:39,167
I don't look at you that way.

81
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:43,136
I don't know how old you are. Let's say you're 20.

82
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,742
So you and I...

83
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,820
I'm 32, so we're 12 years apart.

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,594
But I don't...

85
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,047
feel that I have to babysit you

86
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:57,453
like you were my kid, or that
I don't see you as a potential girlfriend.

87
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,815
There are things we do for each other as a couple.

88
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:05,190
Having butterflies for each other,
giving each other support.

89
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,884
I see you in the way that

90
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,415
adults see each other.

91
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:12,517
That means everyone here sees you that way.

92
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,298
But...

93
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,150
you keep telling yourself,
"We have a big age difference."

94
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,009
"My age..."

95
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:22,450
You're making yourself depressed over this.

96
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,603
Thank you for saying that.

97
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:30,520
I don't know what's wrong with me.

98
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:32,982
Nothing. You can't blame yourself.

99
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,654
You blaming yourself

100
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,310
doesn't help anyone. It doesn't help you.

101
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,732
No, I guess not.

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,209
It doesn't help anyone.

103
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,517
I've seen you act like...

104
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:51,525
you already gave up.

105
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:54,689
I see that almost every day,

106
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,095
that you act like it's hopeless.

107
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,398
My heart just breaks for you.

108
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:04,308
So I wanted to talk to you once.

109
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,441
But...

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,816
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,132
I should stop feeling guilty
and feel grateful instead.

112
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,200
And stop thanking everyone.

113
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,468
It feels good to talk like this.

114
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:24,038
(Now that Hangyeol opened up
about her frustration, will she feel better?)

115
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,413
- What?
- Nothing. It's cute.

116
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:29,416
Jelly?

117
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:34,002
(Mirang bought jelly for Dagyo.)

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,814
Why do you always remind me of peaches?

119
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,142
- You've been told that, right?
- Peaches.

120
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:41,705
Huh?

121
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,481
Even though this is strawberry-flavored,

122
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,754
why do I want to say peaches?

123
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:47,973
Peaches.

124
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,318
I see.

125
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:57,094
What were you guys discussing when I was out?

126
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,834
I wanted to ask you if you texted me.

127
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:01,887
Yes.

128
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:04,849
So from now on you won't get to know other people?

129
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,262
Mm.

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,245
Why? You want to?

131
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,455
No, I was just wondering
if you were that confident.

132
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,002
If I said I wanted to try
going out on a date with Ms. Heeyoung,

133
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,245
what then?

134
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,783
I wouldn't like that.

135
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,526
The outfit I wore today,

136
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:28,534
I wasn't going to wear that scarf,

137
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,761
but the color of your outfit

138
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,839
- I saw this morning matched it.
- That was why?

139
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,319
- So that's why...
- I'm so oblivious.

140
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,198
- I wore it.
- Really?

141
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:42,670
So if I got a date with someone else,

142
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,063
I would throw it away.

143
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,051
But what I'm sure is that

144
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:52,295
right now I don't want to go
on a date with someone else at all.

145
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,911
But I don't want you to feel uncomfortable

146
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,442
when you go out with someone else.

147
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,942
I was joking about throwing away the scarf.

148
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:01,401
Did it sound like a joke?

149
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:03,442
Half-joking, half-serious.

150
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,460
But thank you for...

151
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,674
- I think I should do this.
- being honest.

152
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,099
It's like what Heeyoung said.

153
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:16,482
People may not say what they think.

154
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:19,404
What do I think? What am I doing?

155
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:21,498
Even though I never say how I feel.

156
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,849
So I thought if I tried once,

157
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,599
it would help me make a decision.

158
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,646
Mm.

159
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,810
But that didn't happen, so...
Basically, it didn't happen.

160
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:35,923
It's fate.

161
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:40,328
Fate didn't let you two go on a date.

162
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,211
The other day, I was

163
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:46,781
very happy and had a blast when we were on a date.

164
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,633
So I thought, "From now on,

165
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:52,244
Dagyo would probably want
to go on a date with only me."

166
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,220
But she said she wanted to
try going on a date with Ms. Heeyoung.

167
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,151
It worries me.

168
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:02,971
It's frustrating too.

169
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,620
What if I choose someone else?

170
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,431
Who do you want to know?

171
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:11,925
It's a secret.

172
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,978
But I already told you mine.

173
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,446
I didn't ask you to tell me.

174
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:17,485
Fine.

175
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:20,169
It's okay, you don't have to. It's fine.

176
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,958
Yes, I don't have to anymore.

177
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,520
Mm, yes.

178
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,840
Thank you for saying that.

179
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,395
Of course I feel good.

180
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,348
Even if you go on a date with someone else,

181
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,395
but I feel that in the end, you will choose me.

182
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,340
Oh. Really?

183
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,856
I...

184
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:49,176
I just do what I want without overthinking.

185
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:51,880
You may feel uncomfortable.

186
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:54,786
It's okay.

187
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,020
Just enjoy it.

188
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,646
Go all out.

189
00:09:58,671 --> 00:09:59,982
"Just enjoy it."

190
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,099
Yes, just enjoy it.

191
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,894
Should we put makgeolli in the fridge?

192
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,011
You're right.

193
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,625
It's like

194
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:11,742
since we're on Jeju Island, we should try it.

195
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,313
Drink it with other people.

196
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:20,126
What's that?

197
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,935
Huh? What's that?

198
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,091
What's that?

199
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,146
Oh.

200
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,635
What?

201
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,105
You think I wrote it?

202
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,471
How could I write it?

203
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:32,987
Who wrote it?

204
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,058
Who?

205
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,955
Oh, today's dinner? So they wrote it.

206
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,904
I see. But why did they draw a heart?

207
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,952
- I know. The heart surprised me.
- Wait.

208
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:42,843
And why are you offended?

209
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,599
That's funny.

210
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:49,780
Very forward.

211
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,331
I'll draw a knife.

212
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,495
(The heart is cut in half by Mirang.)

213
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,546
(Darkness visits the ToGetHer Houses)

214
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,018
(Searching)

215
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:09,859
(Sneaking a glance)

216
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,560
What are you looking for?

217
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:23,161
(Heeyoung doesn't say anything.)

218
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,786
Why don't you answer me?

219
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:29,645
Why don't you answer my question?

220
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,269
I asked what you were looking for.

221
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,675
I said nothing.

222
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,558
I answered.

223
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,759
Are you mad at me?

224
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,845
Are you mad? Huh?

225
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:45,384
It's nothing.

226
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,732
"Is there something to be mad at?"

227
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,084
Didn't you want to say that?

228
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,021
- Huh?
- Don't wanna talk about this?

229
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:01,923
Do you really understand
what I was trying to say?

230
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,058
Just answer this one. Do you understand

231
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,558
what I was trying to say?

232
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:11,665
Do you understand?

233
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,876
Oi. Huh.

234
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:15,926
Why?

235
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:19,946
We'll talk later.

236
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,488
I have to cook dinner.

237
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:31,847
(The attempt to have
a conversation ends there.)

238
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:41,808
(Will they be able to patch things up?)

239
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,120
Did I leave my cellphone there?

240
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,136
Did I leave my cellphone there?

241
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:56,612
Did I leave my cellphone?

242
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,734
Probably. It's not here.

243
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,719
Looks like Heeyoung's very mad at me.

244
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,297
- Huh?
- She's mad at me.

245
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:04,437
- Who?
- Heeyoung.

246
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:05,726
- Why?
- No idea.

247
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,884
- Didn't you guys just talk?
- You didn't say anything?

248
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:09,657
Didn't you just talk?

249
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,461
We were about to but got interrupted.

250
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:14,944
I asked her if she didn't want to talk.

251
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:16,149
She said no.

252
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,071
And said she had to go cook dinner.

253
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,549
Really?

254
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:23,397
Like she didn't wanna engage.

255
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,378
I asked, "Can we talk?"

256
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,378
"You don't want to talk?"

257
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,834
"Then can you listen? I wanna say something."

258
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:30,936
But she said nothing.

259
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,585
- Nothing at all?
- Nothing at all.

260
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:34,405
For real?

261
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,264
She said one thing. "I chose you too."

262
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,550
She did say something.

263
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,449
We can't be friends with someone we fancy
without feeling comfortable,

264
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:46,091
but we have to live together here.

265
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:50,009
I wanted to tell her
I wanted to feel comfortable living here,

266
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,234
but she kept avoiding the subject.

267
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,719
And now...

268
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,094
And just now I asked what she was
looking for. She didn't answer me.

269
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:01,411
Totally ignored my question.

270
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,724
I asked what she was looking for.
She didn't answer.

271
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,793
She just said, "Nothing."

272
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:07,302
Really?

273
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:09,543
I grabbed her hand to stop her.

274
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:10,973
- Huh?
- To stop her.

275
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,067
And asked, "Are you mad?"

276
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:15,576
"Can you tell me what you're mad at?"

277
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,795
"We'll talk later. I have to cook dinner."

278
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,881
I'm not exaggerating. Like that.

279
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:21,794
But...

280
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,140
I don't think I did anything
that would make her mad.

281
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,046
I was shocked and it broke my heart.

282
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:33,905
I don't like feeling awkward around someone.

283
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:36,827
That's what worries me.

284
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:40,955
It's fine if she stopped liking me
or changed her mind.

285
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,950
- I'm okay with that.
- About that,

286
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:46,574
you two have to discuss alone.

287
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,183
It's fine with me.

288
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,587
- But how do we broach it?
- That's it.

289
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:54,564
It's like I'm bothering her,
like I'm hurting her feelings.

290
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,651
Yes, there are feelings involved,

291
00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:02,144
but we all have to live together here.

292
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:04,987
It'll be awkward if this continues.

293
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,614
But on the other hand, if she wants to talk...

294
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,834
I don't know.

295
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,045
Right now I think we should go eat dinner.

296
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,217
My cellphone...

297
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,114
And personally, if we can't

298
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:23,114
face each other and have to sleep alone,

299
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,607
it'll feel like I'm cut off from everyone.

300
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,565
Seriously, I felt I was friendless
for a minute there.

301
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,381
- When?
- When I came back.

302
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,961
I saw you two were gonna talk,

303
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:35,770
- so I left on purpose.
- But she looked very stressed.

304
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:39,270
I felt like a high schooler with no friends.

305
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,702
The worst feeling ever.

306
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,796
It can't be helped.

307
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,671
Now...

308
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,155
(The misunderstanding
that keeps getting worse)

309
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,827
What's this? Who did this?

310
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,734
Who drew a heart like that?

311
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,148
So you cut it in half?

312
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:57,515
That was me.

313
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:02,487
You wrote it because you're the chef?

314
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:08,823
(Today's dinner chefs: Heeyoung and Mirang)

315
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:11,003
How long will it take you?

316
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,444
It should be ready soon.

317
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,575
Really?

318
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,640
So I'm gonna make something easy.

319
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,637
- Should I make fried rice?
- Fried rice?

320
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:21,350
- So it's done fast.
- Oh, great.

321
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:22,749
I think I'm gonna use ham.

322
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,243
- I like putting ham in kimchi fried rice.
- I like ham too.

323
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,455
I use pork shoulder
when I make soybean paste stew.

324
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,594
Okay, okay.

325
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:31,458
- Okay.
- Okay?

326
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:32,762
- Okay.
- Done.

327
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:35,069
We're a good cooking team.

328
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,858
(Both women start making dinner.)

329
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,478
This should be enough to make kimchi fried rice.

330
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:53,784
You're really experienced.

331
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,604
(Bowlful)

332
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:01,638
(Sweeping)

333
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:03,433
(Dinner cooking that goes smoothly)

334
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:06,077
It's not hot enough. Wanna switch?

335
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:07,927
Wanna switch?

336
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:08,984
Just a sec.

337
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,063
(Both chefs work well together.)

338
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:16,992
Great.

339
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,477
(Their delicious dinner)

340
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:24,771
Okay.

341
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,237
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

342
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,551
(Wow)
Wow!

343
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,086
(Mirang's soybean paste stew is ready)
Potful.

344
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,641
Wow, there's so much.

345
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,907
Holy cow, it looks delicious.

346
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,149
You guys are so good.

347
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,681
You're such good cooks.

348
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,385
Look at the eggs. It's crazy.

349
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,119
(Heeyoung's kimchi fried rice)
Good and fast.

350
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,519
Who are these people?

351
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,597
Is this water eaten?

352
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:50,253
Ms. Minwoo. Minwoo's gonna sit here.

353
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,614
(Heeyoung moves.)

354
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:55,543
It's Minwoo's seat.

355
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,560
Do you usually sit here? I didn't know.

356
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:02,982
- Me?
- Yeah.

357
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,763
I can sit anywhere.

358
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,443
Heeyoung, come sit here.

359
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:08,505
Come here.

360
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:10,936
(Heeyoung sits far away from Jinah.)

361
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,612
Huh?

362
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,264
Heeyoung, come here.

363
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,544
- What the heck?
- Just sit here.

364
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,819
It's like no one wants to sit next to me.

365
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:22,444
(Acts oblivious)

366
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,928
(Confused)

367
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,537
Bon appétit.

368
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:28,775
Bon appétit.

369
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,471
Delicious. This is so good.

370
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:32,912
Bon appétit.

371
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,693
Oh, the stew is so good.

372
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:36,724
- That's crazy.
- Tastes like there's crab.

373
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,786
So delicious.

374
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:43,078
(Ahh)
I wanna eat crab.

375
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:44,118
Yes.

376
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,277
Reactions while eating...

377
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,130
You must be a chef.

378
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,192
Your secret job must be a chef.

379
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,606
Looks like it.

380
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,340
Is it spicy?

381
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,645
- Which one?
- Mm.

382
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,481
You didn't ask me, but I answered.

383
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,404
Not salty either.

384
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,365
So...

385
00:19:21,668 --> 00:19:24,835
(Today's dinner is especially quiet.)

386
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,085
Why does everyone seem down today?

387
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:30,661
- Getting tired.
- Tired.

388
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:33,536
My face right now is saying
it's delicious and I'm happy.

389
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,427
It's good that the weather is cold.

390
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:38,239
But we had warm clear soup at lunch...

391
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,326
What's that?

392
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,545
Oh.

393
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,870
(What are the texts they get unexpectedly?)

394
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:58,027
(Time to send love letters)

395
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:00,423
What should I do?

396
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,673
Hm?

397
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,641
Any idea who you'll write today?

398
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:05,352
What do you think?

399
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:06,738
Haven't decided yet?

400
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:08,316
How could I?

401
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:12,207
Someone who cruised in smoothly.

402
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:14,187
How is this smooth?

403
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,288
Are you guys fighting?

404
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,585
No, we were just...

405
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,096
talking and had to stop.

406
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,447
But I tried to

407
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:26,096
listen to what she said,
but I don't get her meaning at all.

408
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:30,469
I waited for her to make a sincere gesture.

409
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:31,932
You want sincerity?

410
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:32,975
Yes.

411
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:36,096
Because she told me that
so often from the beginning.

412
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:39,015
Even though I thought it was a little too fast.

413
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,152
Okay, I get that,
but let's get to know each other slowly.

414
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:42,292
It seemed too fast.

415
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:45,605
So I thought we'd focus on
learning about each other.

416
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,871
But suddenly she sped up again.

417
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:51,007
- Well...
- She said the same thing to me.

418
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:53,233
And cried. So what am I now?

419
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,435
I think that's how Ms. Jinah is.

420
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:59,631
She might say
we'll get to know each other slowly,

421
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:02,334
but she probably wants you
to show some reassurance.

422
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:07,022
(Heeyoung hesitates after talking to Jinah.)

423
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:11,194
(Who will they write
their fourth love letters?)

424
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:12,895
It's here, right?

425
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:35,311
There are a lot of activities today.

426
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,287
At night...

427
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:43,826
There are two letters.

428
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:45,825
"The person you want to spend the night with,"

429
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,100
and "love rival letter."

430
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:51,025
The night I want is a night of passion.

431
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,174
But the night I need right now

432
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:57,247
is a night of conversation.

433
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,372
I wrote it because I wanted us to talk alone.

434
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:06,845
I care the most for the person
I want to spend tonight with.

435
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,643
I was ready to write immediately.

436
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:10,845
One letter to a rival.

437
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,730
Another one to the person
I want to spend tonight with.

438
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,969
Not exactly a love rival, but more like,

439
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:25,035
"I'm actually very envious."

440
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,688
That was why I wrote her.

441
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,943
Or should I write with my left hand?

442
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,938
(Carefully written love rival letters)

443
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,566
(and love letters to the person
they want to spend tonight with)

444
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:15,129
(Jinah walking, especially disheartened)

445
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:44,016
(Heeyoung doesn't seem at peace either.)

446
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:49,547
(Sulky)

447
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:52,829
(Noticing)

448
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,434
Why do you look so out of it?

449
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:57,785
- Me?
- Yes.

450
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:00,516
Did you guys have a long talk?

451
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,603
I was confused and didn't know what to do.

452
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:09,575
And I didn't understand that gesture at all.

453
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,900
I wanted it to end with clarity.

454
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,069
So I went to talk again.

455
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:33,483
Are you...

456
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,023
- Huh?
- Go ahead.

457
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,999
We didn't finish talking so I came to continue.

458
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:46,429
Oh.

459
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:47,476
Why?

460
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,483
Can we talk later?

461
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:51,608
I want to be alone.

462
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:52,898
Really?

463
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:56,814
We can't talk?

464
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,757
I don't know

465
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:02,023
I want to be alone. Sorry.

466
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:05,478
Why don't we talk a little?

467
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:11,064
Our conversation stopped abruptly earlier.

468
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,736
I didn't get to say what I thought

469
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,494
because there wasn't time.

470
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,880
So if there's a misunderstanding,
I want to clear it up.

471
00:25:18,795 --> 00:25:19,905
If so

472
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,723
I think it's better than
us stressed due to confusion.

473
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:25,576
It's better to talk to each other about it.

474
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,439
But if it's difficult to talk and you need time,

475
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:28,646
I can wait.

476
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:31,419
Really? You're sure you can talk?

477
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,466
(What are they going to talk about?)

478
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,157
Did you say all you had to say
from your perspective earlier?

479
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:50,478
If I have to summarize, it's that...

480
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,904
I like you from the beginning.

481
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,177
I fell for you.

482
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,958
I don't think I'll change my mind.

483
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:03,282
I want to say I like you too.

484
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:04,625
I like you, but...

485
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,758
I was afraid if I said it,
you'd feel uncomfortable.

486
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,144
Even after I went on a date...

487
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:14,464
with everyone else,

488
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,675
you're the only one I care about.

489
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,410
- Still deciding?
- Same with the letters.

490
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:22,855
- Yesterday I...
- Mm.

491
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,109
I got to go on a date with someone
I wanted to go on a date with.

492
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,759
- Mm.
- I forgot that

493
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:30,497
other people chose by choosing the paintings.

494
00:26:30,744 --> 00:26:31,920
If that was the case,

495
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,639
I thought I had to write someone else's name.

496
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,709
The love letter?

497
00:26:38,874 --> 00:26:40,444
Mm. The first day too.

498
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:43,637
The person who impressed me initially.
And if they have us write twice a day,

499
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:47,966
I thought, "If I want to know someone new,

500
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:50,310
do I have to be paired with that person?"

501
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:54,065
So I tried to...

502
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:57,216
show you another side.

503
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:59,300
I'm human too.

504
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:01,503
- Mm.
- If I said...

505
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,214
I didn't send you a letter

506
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:08,646
because of this thinking,

507
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:10,975
you might feel that

508
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:13,522
I didn't actually like you but just felt guilty.

509
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,573
So I...

510
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,729
wanted to show more that I liked you.

511
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,950
I must have got it wrong.

512
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,244
Because I was very happy to get a letter from you.

513
00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:29,008
On the second day when we went on a date,

514
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:30,596
it...

515
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:32,713
I...

516
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,635
For you, you might come here
to get to know new people.

517
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,526
But I just wanted to see

518
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:44,112
just one drop of water from a stone.

519
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,846
But actually,

520
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
if I didn't say it clearly,

521
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:52,937
people would interpret it.

522
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:55,023
That's why.

523
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,055
Today too.

524
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,886
I was called out first.
I was afraid you would misunderstand,

525
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,363
"Jinah chose someone else to go on a date with."

526
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:05,722
I was afraid you'd think that.

527
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,352
And I'd thought you wouldn't have chosen me.

528
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:12,797
I didn't choose you.

529
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,711
"Because you chose someone else."

530
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:16,911
"So we weren't paired up."

531
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,664
"Because I choose you." I wanted to say that.

532
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,367
Mm.

533
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,274
But...

534
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:29,940
And I didn't want to go
on a date with someone else

535
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:32,722
because I was uncomfortable with you.

536
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,027
But now...

537
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,640
I...

538
00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:43,913
I don't know what I did
to hurt your feelings that much.

539
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:45,045
I'm...

540
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,378
very afraid...

541
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:51,566
very afraid of us avoiding each other.

542
00:28:56,216 --> 00:28:58,406
I worked in television from a young age.

543
00:28:58,544 --> 00:29:01,269
There was a short period of time
where I had no friends.

544
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,683
As a woman, I like you very much.

545
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,808
You started avoiding me since

546
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:11,300
the go-karting.

547
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,719
I was afraid that if I followed you around,

548
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:17,485
it would make you uncomfortable.

549
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,375
So I sneaked away.

550
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,055
Turned out I had no one at all.

551
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:25,020
So it made me...

552
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,383
No one...

553
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:34,906
purposely wants that to happen.

554
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:38,055
But because of my trauma,

555
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:39,766
Mm.

556
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:41,562
It made me disheartened.

557
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,680
I see.

558
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,836
I was afraid that I...

559
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:48,951
would hate you for a reason

560
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,779
that didn't matter to us at all.

561
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,612
You've done nothing wrong. It's just...

562
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:02,854
even if I

563
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,634
don't end with you,

564
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:08,260
I want us to have a close friendship.

565
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:09,529
I understand.

566
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:14,967
I don't get anything from it.
It's fine if you don't like me.

567
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,722
That's not the reason.

568
00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:19,652
I understand. Calm down first.

569
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:21,879
Tell me when you're ready to listen.

570
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,834
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Huh?

571
00:30:24,426 --> 00:30:27,131
So for me,

572
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,082
when I first arrived, I got to talk to everyone,

573
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,949
get to know everyone.

574
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,385
Then I asked you to go
on a date for the first time

575
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:39,470
because I was interested in you.

576
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,655
But for me,

577
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,494
being interested in someone,

578
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,634
wanting to know someone,
it's not an easy thing at all.

579
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,542
So that worried me a lot before I came here.

580
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,140
But I'm glad that you're here.

581
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:56,147
But...

582
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:00,484
you said you she wrote me a letter,

583
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,500
so now I know.

584
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:05,383
Of course I'm happy.

585
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:06,700
Yeah.

586
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,325
But...

587
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:12,415
But I was watching you,
even if for a short time.

588
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,871
But we got to talk intimately.

589
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,670
Things...

590
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,983
Things went haywire.

591
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,627
I thought it progressed too fast.

592
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:22,819
So that day,

593
00:31:23,027 --> 00:31:25,881
it weighed on me that we didn't talk.

594
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:27,749
So I tried to talk.

595
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:31,444
That led to us talking about something profound

596
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,646
in rapid succession.

597
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:35,091
- Your attitude.
- Me?

598
00:31:35,116 --> 00:31:36,624
- Yes.
- The first date?

599
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,706
Since before we went on a date.

600
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,081
But I was still okay back then.

601
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,879
I could sense that
you were a very articulate person

602
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,136
and you wanted to convey your thoughts.

603
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:47,583
That was my first impression.

604
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:52,075
And I thought your attitude
regarding that matched mine,

605
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,522
so I wanted to know you better.

606
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:57,948
And when we went on a date,
it was to learn about each other.

607
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:00,722
I felt that it was too fast.

608
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:01,755
That's possible.

609
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,674
But I told you that.

610
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:05,150
I told you then and there.

611
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,135
I wanted us to get to know each other slowly.

612
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,674
On the first two days of voting,

613
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:11,097
you sent me letters.

614
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:13,324
But there's no second place for me.

615
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,441
I'm...

616
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:18,560
not interested in other people.

617
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:19,888
I don't even look at them.

618
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:22,576
I just laugh and have fun with them.

619
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,130
It's like I...

620
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,920
Like...

621
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,295
Cover it a little.

622
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,420
Mm.

623
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,318
I also think you have goals

624
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:36,802
and the attitude that I like.

625
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,849
You have many aspects that I like.

626
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:41,561
I know how difficult that is.

627
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:43,116
It's very cool.

628
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:46,163
And you're the type of person I want to be.

629
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:47,671
But...

630
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:50,926
sincerity is very important to me.

631
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:54,066
I can wait to see
how the other person will take it.

632
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:56,216
And I can wait until the other person

633
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,849
know how they really feel.

634
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:01,910
I can't wait for however long it takes.

635
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:05,420
I'm not in a hurry at all.

636
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:08,014
But it may...

637
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:10,675
cause a misunderstanding.

638
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,457
But I think at least I try to show it,

639
00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:15,578
even if I don't reassure them with words.

640
00:33:15,942 --> 00:33:18,559
But you talked to me about

641
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:21,719
sincerity from the beginning.

642
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,951
"If the other person doesn't have it,
they're not charming."

643
00:33:25,976 --> 00:33:27,919
That made me feel uncomfortable.

644
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,972
But when they were alone,
you showed that you liked me a lot.

645
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:34,015
And I thought,

646
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,337
"I see. I believe you about everything."

647
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,379
But you keep changing,

648
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:39,510
in my opinion.

649
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:40,715
Because of the letters?

650
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,932
Those too.

651
00:33:41,957 --> 00:33:43,775
You may say they're just letters.

652
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,660
But it's like, "Good. I see."

653
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:47,739
Let it go, like, "Well, it's possible."

654
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,529
It's been like that until today.

655
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,087
When you left,

656
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,068
if you said you were going on a date,

657
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:56,555
from my perspective, I thought you were going.

658
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,977
I want to clear that up.

659
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,139
But that...

660
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,081
You didn't feel that way?

661
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:03,500
"I go out with someone else because of you."

662
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:04,675
It became that.

663
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:06,768
Of course that confused me.

664
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:09,362
But it felt like you were mocking me.

665
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:11,832
"I chose you, dummy." Then you left.

666
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:14,644
What could I say to that?

667
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,190
I was the one who chose you.

668
00:34:16,215 --> 00:34:17,972
So I thought, "Did she lie?"

669
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:19,426
"She chose me?"

670
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,301
My thought went there.

671
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,443
Because now you couldn't make me trust you.

672
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,208
To be honest, I had no choice.

673
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:30,958
And I won the game today.

674
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:35,969
When I won a date privilege,
I thought I'd choose someone and just go.

675
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,710
But while I was happy about the win,
I suddenly thought,

676
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:40,786
"What do I do?"

677
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,633
"Who do I choose?"

678
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,567
For me, it's difficult enough as it is.

679
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:49,535
Does that make sense?

680
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:50,972
(Nodding)

681
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:57,551
So if there was a misunderstanding
between us today,

682
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:59,434
I want there to be a possibility.

683
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:03,656
Earlier when you talked to me honestly,

684
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:07,195
it felt like you summarized
my feelings for you again.

685
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:08,414
Mm.

686
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:10,290
So I...

687
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,665
I want us to be sisters.

688
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,712
Hm.

689
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:17,204
It's for the best.

690
00:35:22,258 --> 00:35:24,269
I don't know if it's right.

691
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,613
I'll tell the crew later.

692
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,082
Tell them what?

693
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,310
I don't want to be here anymore.

694
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:34,505
I'm sorry.

695
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:35,810
You want to leave?

696
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:37,685
Mm. I think it's for the best.

697
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:42,083
It's been very hard for me all day today.

698
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,921
The situation today.

699
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:46,325
And I have nothing against you at all.

700
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,248
It's fine you don't like me, of course.

701
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,803
Everyone's here for that reason.

702
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:51,162
- No.
- No, no.

703
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:52,687
- Everyone's here for that.
- I said no.

704
00:35:52,712 --> 00:35:54,530
And what about what I said today?

705
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,507
No, we can be sisters.

706
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:58,155
I'm okay with that, but...

707
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:01,187
I can't handle being a participant on the show.

708
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:02,766
So you decided?

709
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:05,250
- Yes, gotta find a solution.
- You haven't thought of one?

710
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,211
I gotta try and talk to them.

711
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:09,145
So you make a decision first

712
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,779
then solve the problem later?

713
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:12,546
I gotta try and talk to them.

714
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:15,522
(ToGetHer House 1)

715
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:21,046
(In the end, the conversation
ends without reconciliation.)

716
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:36,851
Hey.

717
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,580
I'm gonna smoke.

718
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:41,228
That seems bad.

719
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,345
Even though I said we could be sisters,

720
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,337
I could feel that

721
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:01,643
it was impossible.

722
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:07,588
"How will I be able to stay in this house?"

723
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:10,417
I was worried about that.

724
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,166
(She finds it harder than before
to write her love letter.)

725
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:07,118
(Pounding headache)

726
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,756
May I go out and get some fresh air?

727
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:13,227
Yes.

728
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:21,391
(Heeyoung's head is filled with confusion.)

729
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,951
When my mine is noisy,

730
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:30,287
I like to go for a walk
and breathe in and out to calm my nerves.

731
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,889
When I walked without thinking

732
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:37,109
and found a beautiful walkway before me,

733
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:38,843
I walked slowly.

734
00:38:38,922 --> 00:38:41,460
It calmed my mind.

735
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:48,124
(After serious consideration,
Heeyoung doesn't write her love letter.)

736
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:53,183
I get bored when I'm alone.

737
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,933
I want to know who you wrote.

738
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,261
- Me?
- Yes.

739
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,279
I've always been interested in Hangyeol.

740
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:08,708
But I think I changed my mind.

741
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:09,849
Really?

742
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:11,100
To who?

743
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,600
I guess I shouldn't ask that.

744
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:18,928
Because you want to know that person better?

745
00:39:18,953 --> 00:39:21,178
Or because of other reasons?

746
00:39:21,683 --> 00:39:23,389
There's a reason.

747
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:24,858
Really?

748
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,959
I'm so curious.

749
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:30,069
So curious.

750
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,280
Is it Ms. Seoyeon?

751
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,038
Maybe not.

752
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:41,350
If not, forget it.

753
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:43,967
So no?

754
00:39:43,992 --> 00:39:46,280
Had to try since you stay in the same room.

755
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:49,163
(Embarrassed)
Forget it.

756
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:51,632
(Cute)
So no?

757
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:53,426
(Dagyo's face gets redder.)
Right?

758
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:54,865
(Dagyo's face gets redder.)

759
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,451
- What's this?
- Your face's about to explode. Are you okay?

760
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,597
I thought it was her.

761
00:40:00,172 --> 00:40:01,769
I blush very easily.

762
00:40:03,058 --> 00:40:04,878
What's your MBTI again?

763
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,440
Me? ESTJ.

764
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:08,277
That's right. ESTJ.

765
00:40:09,093 --> 00:40:10,933
So you're very candid.

766
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:14,269
So if something here feels suffocating,

767
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,316
I will feel very suffocated.

768
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:19,853
What do we have to do to push things forward,

769
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,137
to make progress?

770
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:22,495
- Yes.
- So it's meaningful.

771
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,895
That's why we're here.

772
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,591
I don't like things that make me
feel like I'm wasting time.

773
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:30,966
Yes, you have to take action and show it.

774
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:33,153
You have to make things clear.

775
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:34,974
You have to do something.

776
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,526
This is why I find Ms. Mirang very cool.

777
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,717
That's what I think.

778
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,773
(Mirang returns.)
What? You two are alone?

779
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,999
But it's been two days, right?

780
00:40:49,024 --> 00:40:50,172
For you, yes.

781
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,899
- For us, it's been three.
- Oh, three?

782
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,962
I see.

783
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:54,390
(Minwoo is thinking.)

784
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:55,555
Originally...

785
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:56,602
(Pondering)

786
00:40:56,836 --> 00:41:00,008
To be honest, right now I...

787
00:41:01,817 --> 00:41:04,049
I like Ms. Hwayoung.

788
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:05,736
Huh? Heeyoung?

789
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:07,045
Our Heeyoung, right?

790
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,244
- Heeyoung?
- Yes.

791
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,728
I see.

792
00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:11,759
(Both are shocked by
Minwoo's sudden confession.)

793
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:13,150
I see.

794
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:14,710
From the beginning or

795
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:16,547
the date today changed your mind?

796
00:41:16,572 --> 00:41:18,195
I didn't have that thought before.

797
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,617
But after today's date...

798
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,219
you developed feelings after the date?

799
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:24,035
Did she see Heeyoung in a new light?

800
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,340
She told me she was interested in Heeyoung.

801
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:29,099
So I'm curious what it's like
to go out with Heeyoung alone.

802
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:30,888
What's the difference?

803
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:33,770
But Mirang was there at the time.

804
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:35,365
I almost lost my mind.

805
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,185
I was curious about that,

806
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:39,170
but she was right next to me.

807
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:40,630
I didn't know...

808
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:42,857
how to act.

809
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:45,904
(Sneaking a glance)

810
00:41:46,152 --> 00:41:49,560
When we were kart racing,
we were on the same team.

811
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:51,061
We made pottery together.

812
00:41:51,069 --> 00:41:52,955
We drove around together.

813
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,374
We talked.

814
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:57,561
When I saw her talk and stuff, it was like...

815
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,850
- Really?
- Yes.

816
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:02,681
I really wanted to know her.
When the crew gave us free time,

817
00:42:02,705 --> 00:42:04,064
I came straight here.

818
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:05,758
I see.

819
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:07,640
That's why you came to our room earlier

820
00:42:07,665 --> 00:42:09,611
when the two of us were leaving.

821
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:11,503
Otherwise I would have no reason to come.

822
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,292
Like earlier I sat next to her during dinner.

823
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:18,175
- Wow.
- Followed her until the last second.

824
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:25,502
(Minwoo opens up to Dagyo and Mirang.)

825
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,541
(What about Heeyoung
who Minwoo has feelings for?)

826
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:35,170
She said she'd leave.

827
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,272
- Huh?
- She's leaving.

828
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:37,375
Huh?!

829
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:40,842
- That's taking things too far.
- So I...

830
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:44,108
I genuinely tried to stop her.

831
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:48,929
But the fact that you tried to stop her, it's...

832
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:52,459
I don't want her to leave.

833
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:55,584
I tried to make her understand.

834
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:57,303
I told her everything honestly.

835
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,990
And earlier I went to write the letters...

836
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,439
The questions were...

837
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,582
That's right.

838
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,213
I said I couldn't write

839
00:43:08,238 --> 00:43:10,158
and asked to get some fresh air.

840
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:15,591
(Because she's spent a lot of time with Jinah,
it's not easy to write.)

841
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:19,872
But I can't make myself do anything right now.

842
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:22,865
But about that,

843
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,724
you didn't do anything wrong.

844
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:27,740
It's not even your responsibility.

845
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:30,770
She said she knew that.

846
00:43:31,029 --> 00:43:32,139
Then why?

847
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:35,185
We talked and we understood each other.

848
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,232
Mm.

849
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:39,764
I told her to sleep
and decide when she wakes up.

850
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:42,304
I have my hopes so I want us to be friendly.

851
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:44,113
I might not be able to stop her.

852
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:45,992
So I told her to sleep before deciding.

853
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,335
That might help her get over our conversation.

854
00:43:49,446 --> 00:43:50,978
But she said

855
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:53,001
she felt that today.

856
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:56,118
I drew the line that kept her out.

857
00:43:57,487 --> 00:43:59,115
She said she didn't blame me

858
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,199
but the situation was too hard for her to handle.

859
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,229
Huh?

860
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:06,674
She couldn't tell people it was because of me.

861
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,270
Said that she felt alone.

862
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:14,770
It seems she really got ahead of herself.

863
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,959
It makes me feel bad for her.

864
00:44:17,984 --> 00:44:18,993
But that's not true.

865
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:20,131
Of course not.

866
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,217
I told her how I felt.

867
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:25,545
And I shared my perspective from the beginning.

868
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:28,476
I don't know what to do.

869
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:29,804
Don't know what to do with myself.

870
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:32,304
But you don't have to do anything.

871
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:33,341
You did nothing wrong.

872
00:44:33,366 --> 00:44:35,671
You two just got paired up.

873
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,448
It feels like I'm bound.

874
00:44:39,488 --> 00:44:41,409
- Mm.
- I can't do anything.

875
00:44:41,434 --> 00:44:43,768
It feels like I'm trapped in

876
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,979
a room with swords in every direction.

877
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:50,440
(Heeyoung opens up to Seoyeon.)

878
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,729
Thank you.

879
00:44:54,335 --> 00:44:56,757
- Thank you for keeping me company.
- Don't mention it.

880
00:44:56,782 --> 00:44:57,913
I don't know who else to talk to.

881
00:44:58,156 --> 00:44:59,264
Don't mention it.

882
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:02,249
(Heeyoung's heart is lost in the chaos.)

883
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:07,837
(Day 4 at the ToGetHer Houses)

884
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:12,737
(What will get the girls rattled today?)

885
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:23,418
(Minwoo and Mirang get some exercise
early in the morning.)

886
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,520
(The secret to Seoyeon's firm skin)

887
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,458
(Essence-filled toner pads)

888
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:36,067
(Hydrate your skin)

889
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:43,683
(Keep your skin firm all day with toner pads)

890
00:45:56,573 --> 00:46:01,184
(A simple skincare step completed)

891
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:03,039
Can you help me

892
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:05,155
tie these into a bow?

893
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,092
How do I tie?

894
00:46:07,117 --> 00:46:08,483
The ribbons on the shoulder.

895
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:11,077
Ah. You're in a pretty dress.

896
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:13,650
I can't do it myself.

897
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,713
(While everyone energetically
prepares for the day,)

898
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:22,833
(Jinah is nowhere to be seen.)

899
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:25,997
(Where is Jinah?)

900
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:29,268
They're here.

901
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:31,193
The love letters?

902
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,192
Oh, my God.

903
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:38,796
(It's time to read
the love letters written yesterday.)

904
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:44,124
(The person they want to spend the night with
and their love rival who makes them restless)

905
00:46:44,172 --> 00:46:48,156
(Seoyeon has gotten a letter from Minwoo.
Will she get one this time?)

906
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:52,928
I thought so.

907
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,768
Oh, I'm tired.

908
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:01,753
(Seoyeon's mailbox is empty.)

909
00:47:01,874 --> 00:47:03,714
But I figured it would be like this.

910
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:07,512
No one currently shows that they like me.

911
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:11,660
It's like I don't exist.

912
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,426
(What kind of letters will Mirang get?)

913
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:22,236
I got one. Probably a rival.

914
00:47:24,593 --> 00:47:27,025
(One letter to Mirang)

915
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:28,994
Eh?

916
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:35,169
To Mirang, I like you.

917
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:40,528
It was when I decided to give up on Dagyo.

918
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:43,646
Ever since we started living in this house,

919
00:47:43,662 --> 00:47:46,076
I've spent every night with Ms. Mirang.

920
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:49,310
I want to continue being her roommate.

921
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,012
I want someone older as my roommate.

922
00:47:54,153 --> 00:47:56,106
That's why I'm writing to you, Ms. Mirang.

923
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:58,715
I don't want to check.

924
00:48:01,943 --> 00:48:06,028
(Despite not wanting to,
she has to check her mailbox.)

925
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:11,708
(Minwoo finds a place that allows privacy.)

926
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:16,110
(Three letters to Minwoo)

927
00:48:16,547 --> 00:48:17,837
To Minwoo,

928
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:19,555
sweet dreams.

929
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:24,771
Ms. Minwoo seems very close to Mirang

930
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:27,389
that it makes me jealous.

931
00:48:27,414 --> 00:48:30,271
I don't hate Minwoo.

932
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:33,811
I might feel a little intimidated,
but I don't hate her.

933
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:37,135
So I wrote her something amicable too.

934
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,060
That's why I wrote, "Sweet dreams."

935
00:48:41,097 --> 00:48:43,057
Based on the phrase "sweet dreams,"

936
00:48:43,324 --> 00:48:46,449
it's probably someone who knows
I don't sleep well.

937
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:48,253
That's my thinking.

938
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:50,035
The phrase "sweet dreams"

939
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:52,879
probably has many hidden meanings.

940
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,574
So I look at this letter positively.

941
00:48:56,741 --> 00:49:00,537
To Ms. Minwoo,
thank you for saying I'm beautiful.

942
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,248
It was exactly what I wanted to hear.

943
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,236
It's not that I want to
spend the night with Ms. Minwoo,

944
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,314
but she chose me to go on the first date.

945
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:13,994
She complimented my looks a lot then.

946
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:15,511
Ever since I could remember,

947
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,979
I haven't gotten a lot of compliments

948
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:20,628
that I'm attractive.

949
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:24,550
So I want to thank her for that just once.

950
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:28,113
So I wrote her to thank her.

951
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,535
This one must be Ms. Hangyeol.

952
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:32,775
Because I said that to Ms. Hangyeol

953
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,934
in front of everyone.

954
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:38,137
But I feel like she's saying thanks

955
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:39,817
for understand how she felt.

956
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:42,310
So I felt very flattered reading that.

957
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:46,427
Making progress like this isn't bad either.

958
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:48,388
That's how I feel.

959
00:49:53,964 --> 00:49:55,893
I want to read a love rival letter.

960
00:49:55,918 --> 00:49:57,830
I think there are people who like Mirang

961
00:49:57,901 --> 00:49:59,651
and notice she's only interested in me.

962
00:49:59,683 --> 00:50:02,143
They must not like seeing that.

963
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:05,658
I really want to know who likes Mirang.

964
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:08,799
It's cold.

965
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:13,893
(Dagyo receives one letter.)

966
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:17,963
To Dagyo,

967
00:50:18,038 --> 00:50:21,276
I want to talk to you one-on-one more.

968
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:23,144
And I miss you.

969
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:28,488
Eh, why?

970
00:50:28,513 --> 00:50:31,495
Why aren't there any rivals? Why?

971
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,879
Or because she

972
00:50:32,903 --> 00:50:35,543
focuses only on me and it puts off other people?

973
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:38,411
I'm glad but I'm bummed too.

974
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:39,707
I want some rival letters.

975
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:43,340
But not getting any is a good thing.

976
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:50,199
(Heeyoung's finding a place to be alone.)

977
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:55,819
What should I do?

978
00:50:56,448 --> 00:50:57,460
Here is perfect.

979
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:10,169
(Paranoid)

980
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:15,638
(Heeyoung receives five letters.)

981
00:51:20,614 --> 00:51:21,629
To Heeyoung,

982
00:51:21,669 --> 00:51:24,863
I don't want you to say no one likes you

983
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:27,035
because I wanted to know you from the beginning.

984
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:30,012
I wanted to write Heeyoung to let her know

985
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:31,638
because I've barely showed my interest.

986
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:33,365
So that she pays me some attention.

987
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,349
Because if I didn't write her today,
I probably wouldn't get another chance.

988
00:51:37,374 --> 00:51:39,022
We don't know what will happen.

989
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:40,683
So I followed my initial feeling.

990
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:43,514
And I already talked to Mirang yesterday.

991
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:47,357
I thought, "Okay, let's do this."

992
00:51:48,087 --> 00:51:49,666
So I chose to write Heeyoung.

993
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:54,182
It's not about the handwriting.

994
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,768
I just knew it was Dagyo.

995
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:58,949
You could say that I knew by instinct.

996
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:01,625
I don't know about others,
but I'm sure about this one.

997
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,628
It was the first letter I opened.

998
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:05,397
I'm very happy.

999
00:52:05,841 --> 00:52:07,537
And very grateful.

1000
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:12,303
(So what is the second letter like?)

1001
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:16,795
To Heeyoung,

1002
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,423
what makes it feel so dark? I'm sorry

1003
00:52:19,448 --> 00:52:22,710
I always keep to myself. It breaks my heart.

1004
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,526
I made it clear that it's from Kim Jinah.

1005
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,596
I wanted to talk to her with gentle words.

1006
00:52:29,621 --> 00:52:32,195
Wanted to talk as people who know each other

1007
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,448
with peace of mind

1008
00:52:33,854 --> 00:52:37,190
for the remaining days here. So I wrote her.

1009
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:39,580
To Heeyoung,

1010
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,565
I wanna see the bubble bombs that you brought.

1011
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:45,361
The day I arrived, Ms. Heeyoung

1012
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:48,752
said there was a bathtub here,
she'd brought bubble bombs.

1013
00:52:48,777 --> 00:52:50,244
I thought of that word.

1014
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,815
I want to try using them together.

1015
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,800
But I also wanted her to know I wrote this.

1016
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,465
When she made kimchi fried rice,

1017
00:52:57,481 --> 00:52:59,975
I told her she'd cut the ham into very big cubes,

1018
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,277
so I drew a big cube of ham too.

1019
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:07,333
(Peeking)

1020
00:53:07,538 --> 00:53:08,693
Don't come in here.

1021
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:09,849
(Frozen)

1022
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,247
Please go away.

1023
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:14,380
Let me adjust the heat and I'll go.

1024
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:20,930
To Heeyoung,

1025
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,805
please be lovey-dovey with someone else

1026
00:53:23,962 --> 00:53:26,688
who's not the person of my choice.

1027
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:31,217
The other person Dagyo's
interested in who's not me

1028
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:32,373
is Heeyoung.

1029
00:53:39,655 --> 00:53:40,747
What's she talking about?

1030
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,083
I have no idea.

1031
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:49,466
And she phrased it kind of weird.

1032
00:53:51,075 --> 00:53:55,927
(Mirang's suddenly called weird.)

1033
00:53:56,327 --> 00:53:58,763
(And the last letter)

1034
00:54:02,196 --> 00:54:05,955
To Ms. Heeyoung,
I don't know if I've ever told you

1035
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,852
that I've been yearning to be you.

1036
00:54:09,684 --> 00:54:12,995
Not exactly a love rival,
but more like, "I'm actually very envious."

1037
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,395
That was why I wrote her.

1038
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,660
Because I want to possess

1039
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:20,963
the charm that you have.

1040
00:54:20,988 --> 00:54:22,707
Yearning. Envy.

1041
00:54:22,731 --> 00:54:27,488
I think in my own way, that's a love rival.

1042
00:54:29,572 --> 00:54:30,831
Again, what does that mean?

1043
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:33,050
What is she trying to say?

1044
00:54:33,644 --> 00:54:34,917
Who is it?

1045
00:54:36,464 --> 00:54:40,643
(Kim Jinah)

1046
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,201
To Jinah, you make me worried,

1047
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:46,086
but you're a lovely rival.

1048
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:48,086
I talked very deeply with Jinah.

1049
00:54:48,102 --> 00:54:52,677
I already know how I feel about Mirang.

1050
00:54:52,702 --> 00:54:55,211
But she's a very lovely person,

1051
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,039
so I don't feel animosity toward her.

1052
00:54:57,102 --> 00:54:59,000
So I wrote she was a lovely rival instead.

1053
00:55:01,008 --> 00:55:03,312
(Will these confusing letters
make them waver?)

1054
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,953
To create memories.

1055
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:08,312
- Huh?
- To create memories.

1056
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:09,737
They'll look good on your phone later.

1057
00:55:09,762 --> 00:55:11,617
Yes, I like digital cameras.

1058
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,162
(Dagyo brought a digital camera.)
Yes.

1059
00:55:13,187 --> 00:55:15,180
So I bought it.

1060
00:55:15,205 --> 00:55:16,345
Oh, cute.

1061
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:20,579
We should be able to upload them on IG one day.

1062
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,344
- So bright.
- Came out weird, eh?

1063
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:24,641
So pretty without a flash.

1064
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,508
Very strong digital-camera vibe.

1065
00:55:28,197 --> 00:55:29,470
I'll take pics of you too.

1066
00:55:30,587 --> 00:55:31,758
(Making a peace sign)

1067
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,563
Just a sec.

1068
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:35,172
You want this vibe?

1069
00:55:38,237 --> 00:55:40,836
(Memories from the ToGetHer Houses)

1070
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:42,926
That's so cute.

1071
00:55:42,951 --> 00:55:44,786
True. Super cute when I zoom in.

1072
00:55:47,162 --> 00:55:48,271
Oh.

1073
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:53,146
(Two girls capturing memories
to remember for a very long time)

1074
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,662
Whoa, my hair.

1075
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:57,029
Why? It looked good.

1076
00:55:57,384 --> 00:55:59,000
You can fix it digitally.

1077
00:55:59,025 --> 00:56:00,508
These are all memories.

1078
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:02,297
Why was my hair like that?

1079
00:56:02,513 --> 00:56:04,696
"What happens when you're out of it."

1080
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:07,149
Remember it through this.

1081
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:12,923
(How will both of them remember this day?)
