1
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,461
What are you going to wear?

2
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:38,593
- Oh, that's not bad.
- I made this.

3
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:41,499
- Oh, really?
- I made this.

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,405
- Try it on. Try it on.
- Body care brand.

5
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:46,026
It's a bit chubby though.

6
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:48,117
Oh, but...

7
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:49,893
This one is cuter.

8
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:52,025
- When going for grocery shopping.
- Yeah, it's uncomfortable.

9
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:54,993
I wore this and ran yesterday.

10
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,924
Wear this one today.

11
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:00,323
- But this one is a bit...
- Oh, did you hear that?

12
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:07,480
(Jinah and Minwoo please prepared
a snack party at Together House)

13
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:09,088
Unbelievable.

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,934
(Dejected)

15
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:15,708
Do I have to stand like this?
Even though

16
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:16,875
I'm already getting ready to go out.

17
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:20,168
If that's the case, then I'd regret it.

18
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:21,690
Maybe I should wear it tomorrow.

19
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,164
No. In this situation, I should take

20
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,459
a Polaroid of this outfit now.

21
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,836
Try that one on. This way.

22
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,423
Try holding it.

23
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:30,664
(Snap)

24
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:33,233
What a shame.

25
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,654
I like Polaroid too.

26
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:39,419
- So funny.
- What? Why isn't it coming out?

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,479
That's twice as sad.

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,567
Ah, it's all used up.

29
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:45,314
- I lost the lid, too.
- Twice as sad.

30
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:49,664
(Both of them exchanged sadness
as if joking)

31
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:52,946
Why is this so hilarious?

32
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:57,553
(Minwoo and Jinah prepare
snacks at home like that)

33
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:01,170
Should we go cook something?

34
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,889
- What should we eat?
- Something like Mille-Feuille Nabe.

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,648
Like, minimal effort but impressive?

36
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,931
Something simple but fancy-looking?

37
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,409
Mille-Feuille Nabe sounds good.

38
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,940
- I just feel tight because...
- Soup dishes didn't cross my mind.

39
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,150
Mm.

40
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,780
(What are you two going to
make for the snack party?)

41
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:21,583
What do we have? What's this.

42
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,514
(The first step of the snack party starts
with checking the fridge)

43
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:25,936
This?

44
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,551
(They found a ready-to-cook meal kit.)
Bought this and left it there.

45
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:32,329
- You can use it for anything.
- Can I mix this and this?

46
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,135
Because they're already seasoned.

47
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:36,567
This and this, maybe with garlic?

48
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,867
- All closed.
- Spring onion, Spam.

49
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:43,646
Let's make something with
what we have first.

50
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:44,916
If we need more, let's do it.

51
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,079
Or... What?

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,771
Rolled radish like this with paprika.

53
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,945
- Make it into finger food.
- Good idea.

54
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,825
Make it one that's not dry.

55
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,333
Then what do we need to do?

56
00:02:57,334 --> 00:03:00,002
These are pre-seasoned.

57
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:03,440
The rest of spam and chicken breast,

58
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:06,427
- Apple.
- And ingredients for dipping sauce?

59
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:07,607
Mm.

60
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:08,754
This is the main dish

61
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,221
and it's really good.

62
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,384
Gochujang to make sauce with

63
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,259
bulgogi kurobuta tteokbokki.

64
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,216
Minwoo said she was
confident in the sauce

65
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:17,554
so we decided to make

66
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,993
Vietnamese spring rolls.

67
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:21,274
I was craving them too.

68
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:27,920
(Jinah starts boiling tteokbokki)

69
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:33,680
(Next, Minwoo puts in
the vegetables she cut)

70
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:35,853
While cooking, I realized.

71
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:37,867
Jinah is unexpectedly good!

72
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:39,173
We worked really well

73
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,459
together when cooking.

74
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:43,203
(Sniffs)

75
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:46,666
I'm a little nervous...

76
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,740
But I think it'll be fine.

77
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:49,833
No matter what happens,

78
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,016
as long as it tastes good.

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,228
It should be tasty

80
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,446
I borrowed the power from

81
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:54,833
the sauce sold in the market.

82
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,567
(The first dish that the two of them
cooked together is finished!)

83
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,137
(Minwoo & Jinah's
kurobuta bulgogi tteokbokki)

84
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:08,094
If I hadn't roomed with you,

85
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,385
I'd have no idea what's going on.

86
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:11,814
I thought seven days have passed.

87
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:13,319
Actually, I think

88
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:15,492
other people are just...

89
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:17,803
People who were hurt by love.

90
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:19,912
So it's hard to stay together.

91
00:04:19,913 --> 00:04:21,680
But, staying here, for me...

92
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,283
Whoever watches or whatever,

93
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:27,419
overthinking is natural.

94
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,822
If you don't express or

95
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:30,576
don't know the situation,

96
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:32,573
time will just pass.

97
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,551
If the person I like

98
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,847
misunderstands me,

99
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,539
it'll feel terrible, won't it?

100
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:42,037
So with people like that, I...

101
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:43,629
- So with people like that, I...
- It's probably better to just talk.

102
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,422
I think it's okay to
express yourself a lot.

103
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:49,522
- Like what?
- Even if you did that...

104
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,748
I don't think it's like being a fool.

105
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,399
That's not strange at all.

106
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:56,565
It looks cuter.

107
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:00,034
So, today's the halfway point.

108
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:01,445
Yes, today the halfway point.

109
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,382
If I don't do something now,

110
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:06,469
it'll just fade away.

111
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:11,005
You feel like my future self.

112
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,170
You've been through it before.

113
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:15,253
And is starting fresh with a new rhythm.

114
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,267
But I haven't gone through

115
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:18,972
anything clear yet.

116
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,701
- A shame isn't it? Don't you regret it?
- It's a pity.

117
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:23,371
I regret that too. I...

118
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:25,804
At first, I thought

119
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,797
I'll date a lot of people.

120
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,417
Since we could only

121
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:33,104
get to know a few people,

122
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,294
it's a bit of a shame, isn't it?

123
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:38,042
Not out of impulsiveness.

124
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,673
I just fear it might end in regret.

125
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:44,095
Minwoo said something that

126
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,471
made me realize that everyone

127
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:47,256
in this house has their own struggles.

128
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,501
It's painful, exhausting,

129
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:50,728
even maddening.

130
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,498
I thought.

131
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:56,142
'Aren't we so beautiful?'
because we're true to that.

132
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:58,045
I've improved because

133
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,750
of Minwoo's humanity.

134
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,633
Because I've said it clearly.

135
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,614
And kept encouraging her.

136
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:05,654
And that makes her shine brighter.

137
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,438
I think she's changed a lot.

138
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,528
People change depending on
who's beside them.

139
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,687
This is nice.

140
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:13,579
Like art, a cooking therapy.

141
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:16,115
Really? So pretty. The perilla leaves

142
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,929
are pretty than I thought.

143
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,454
The perilla leaves are pretty, right?

144
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:24,584
(The two of them talk to each other,
getting to know each other a little better)

145
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,232
(The dish with Minwoo
and Jinah's chemistry)

146
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:34,453
(The food that the two of them cooked.
(As expected.)

147
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:38,538
(Mirang & Seoyeon return to Together House.)
The others in the room might enjoy it.

148
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:41,158
Oh, that's right.

149
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:46,790
Oh, thank you.

150
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,800
(Tilts)

151
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,025
Oh, no.

152
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,395
- What? It died?
- It's dead.

153
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,710
- It's dead?

154
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,211
Oh no, maybe we can revive. Wait.

155
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,603
It's dead?

156
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:03,859
Why did you kill it?

157
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,312
Wait, it's revived!

158
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,226
- It has revived?
- It has revived.

159
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,513
(The dessert that was revived
with difficulty) Please endure a bit.

160
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,316
Killed it, revived it.

161
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,613
Oh, you two came.

162
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:20,110
- You're here?
- Yes. It was dead.

163
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,909
A piece of tangerine fell,

164
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,872
- so I said it was dead.
- Oh, really?

165
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,986
- You made this?
- Yes.

166
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:29,108
Wow, you guys made this?

167
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,006
Yeah, we made all of them.

168
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:33,319
(Heeyoung & Dagyo arrive at Together House)
So exciting.

169
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,328
- Do you know why?
- Why?

170
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:37,926
Because the food's delicious.

171
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:41,760
We didn't even have to cook.

172
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,662
Is this kind of talk too rational?

173
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:48,810
That's true.

174
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,297
After saying for a while,
I was like 'oh?'

175
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:53,062
Ah, not this kind of mood.

176
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,525
You're really logical.

177
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,838
We've arrived.

178
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,369
- Since there's no blender, so...
- You cooked at home?

179
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:02,047
(What are you guys doing?)
- Yes.

180
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:04,380
Ta-da!

181
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,625
- Look at this.
- What is it?

182
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:07,672
There's no blender,

183
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:08,825
so I use a spoon to press

184
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,893
and make the sauce myself.

185
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,236
Looks so delicious.

186
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:12,467
- What is that?
- I made sauce for

187
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,534
Vietnamese spring rolls.

188
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:16,590
Oh, Vietnamese spring rolls.

189
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,881
Why are you so good at this?

190
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:20,436
What did you buy?

191
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:22,604
- I...
- Noodles?

192
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:25,701
Kalguksu and sujebi.

193
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:26,928
I was going to answer that

194
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:28,126
but I was wrong.

195
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,048
- What's that?
- Pizza.

196
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:31,714
Pizza?

197
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:34,036
- Korean pizza.
- Bindae-tteok?

198
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:35,945
Bindae-tteok?

199
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:39,661
(Fidget)

200
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:47,311
(Heeyoung adjusts herself
and takes a deep breath)

201
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:49,283
- What are you doing?
- Maintaining good posture

202
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:50,747
and a clear mind.

203
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:58,143
- It's not a big deal.
- Huh?

204
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:01,111
- It's not a big deal.
- It's not a big deal?

205
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:08,037
No, just hypnotizing myself.

206
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:12,212
Everything passes eventually...

207
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,727
Dagyo.

208
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,039
Aren't you going to change
into your pajamas?

209
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,092
Are you going to change clothes now?

210
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:20,112
Now I can eat comfortably.

211
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:21,450
But I can't eat.

212
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:24,347
- Then let's change our clothes.
- Mm. Let's change our clothes.

213
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:26,855
- Can we change clothes now?
- Yeah, the four of us are

214
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,556
going to change clothes.

215
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,656
- Go to our house.
- Go to our house?

216
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:36,697
- We have to and change into pajamas.
- Right now?

217
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,900
Yay!

218
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:41,868
Oh, my new jeans.

219
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:46,156
Finally time to put on pajamas.

220
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:48,587
Close the door, it's a secret.

221
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,891
Let me change my clothes first.

222
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:53,782
So cute! Everything's cute!

223
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:56,381
(Together house #1
Done changing pajamas)

224
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:59,448
Let's go, go, go!

225
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,793
Why did you bring that, Dagyo?
Oh, is it a lot?

226
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,311
There isn't much space there?

227
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,658
- Afraid there won't be any slippers.
- Yes, there aren't any.

228
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,336
- I brought a pair.
- Three-stripes slippers?

229
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:14,007
No, this is Adidas padding.

230
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:16,558
Really? Feels like we're back in school!

231
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,671
That's right.

232
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,342
(Together House #2 Seoyeon & Heeyoung
Changed into pajamas)

233
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:20,651
So cute.

234
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,067
We're here.

235
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:27,974
Hey.

236
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,218
Everyone's wearing pink.

237
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,422
- No, no.
- No.

238
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,197
(Eight women gathered in one place)

239
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:37,675
- Hello.
- Oh, oh What's on the menu?

240
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:41,620
Ours? Ours is gonna be so good!

241
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,271
I'm curious.

242
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:45,073
- Oh, what's that?
- Ours is definitely delicious!

243
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:48,541
We have dakjeong and mac and cheese.

244
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,466
Wow, that looks so yummy.

245
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:53,788
Let me change my clothes first.

246
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,444
I have to cut this.

247
00:10:57,445 --> 00:11:02,771
(Mirang prepares the cake
she made with Seoyeon)

248
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,270
Did you buy food for your date today?

249
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:06,817
Did you buy food?

250
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:09,536
- Water?
- Water? Downstairs.

251
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,765
- What are you doing?
- You don't need it?

252
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:14,114
- Water?
- Water? Downstairs.

253
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,801
(Closes mouth)
- What are you doing? - Seriously?

254
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:21,134
(Confused)

255
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:24,191
(Mirang drops the cake)

256
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,178
(Unbelievable)

257
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,640
Killed both of them.

258
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:31,784
(Stiff)
This is a party

259
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,911
(a situation where you can
only laugh hopelessly)

260
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,628
What to do?

261
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,810
(Mirang is confused)
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

262
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:39,076
What to do?

263
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:41,995
Wait a minute.

264
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,347
What to do?

265
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:44,744
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,623
Still, it's a cake we made together.

267
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,013
I feel guilty towards Seoyeon

268
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,327
for dropping it.

269
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,072
But the truth is I'm fine.

270
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:56,581
The cake wasn't important anyway.

271
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,933
‘Oops, the cake dropped.'

272
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,442
And we just cleaned it up together.

273
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,168
No, if you only do this on the top...

274
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,840
(Mirang tries to save the cake
out of guilt)

275
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,355
Just throw it away.

276
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,326
Let's fix it like this.

277
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,186
This is fine. Just this part here.

278
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,582
It's fine.

279
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,442
I'll clean it up.

280
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:16,931
Let's add that to make it pretty.

281
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:18,085
Wait, wait.

282
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:20,299
Let's decorate with strawberries.

283
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,768
- Let's add strawberry jam.
- Yeah, let's do it.

284
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,360
(The fate of the cake depends on
everyone's fingertips) That's so kind.

285
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:30,651
I killed that pie.

286
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:32,846
She said I was going to

287
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,159
perform surgery but I killed it.

288
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:36,754
Geez. What a funny funeral.

289
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:37,866
A bear funeral.

290
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,340
Now even funerals can't be held.

291
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:40,624
It vanished completely.

292
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:48,312
(A chaotic but sincere life-saving
measure for the cake)

293
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,536
Oh.

294
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,088
- Is it alright?
- It's great.

295
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:53,814
It's so cute.

296
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:56,937
Mm. Like this.

297
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,464
Why try?

298
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,040
(Rescuing by decorating
with strawberries)

299
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,096
- So cute, put five per layer.
- Sure.

300
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,778
Okay, okay.

301
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,932
If it drips, whatever.

302
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:11,481
(Looks delicious)

303
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:16,969
(The rescued Mirang & Seoyeon's cake
that was saved with the same heart)

304
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:21,107
Wait, you made this?

305
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:24,302
As expected of someone who cooks.

306
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,736
(Dinner prepared after the chaos)

307
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,223
- I like it very much.
- It looks delicious.

308
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,716
(Food prepared with care)
Absolutely amazing.

309
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:33,185
This looks delicious!

310
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,297
What did you prepare?

311
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,098
Hangyeol, how about some introduction?

312
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:42,007
It's just a simple dakgangjeong.

313
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:44,501
I thought it would be good to eat it.

314
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:48,530
So I bought it and...

315
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,675
- What should I say?
- Mac and cheese.

316
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:53,249
Oh, this is a Mac and cheese potato.

317
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,675
- The two of them go so well together.
- Yeah.

318
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:59,922
(Introduced the menu with the explosion
of the chemistry between the two)

319
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,931
We agreed to talk casually.

320
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,740
(Jinah & Minwoo, who have become
closer, start talking casually)

321
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,097
- Really?
- And we made.

322
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:06,774
Ours is kurobuta bulgogi

323
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,350
gochujang tteokbokki soup.

324
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,408
And Vietnamese spring rolls with

325
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,106
a choice of chicken breast or spam.

326
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,154
As for the sauce, there were no tools,

327
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,433
so Minwoo made the sauce from scratch.

328
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,202
- Wow.
- Amazing.

329
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,748
As for the rest...

330
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:23,173
- Dessert?
- Yes.

331
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:24,953
It looks like it's store-bought.

332
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:27,941
(Delicious food made from Jinah & Minwoo's
chemistry) It's as if you brought it from a store.

333
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:32,918
Heeyoung and I went out together.

334
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,689
- And...
- We watched the sea.

335
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,233
The sea?

336
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,709
- The beach was so pretty!
- The beach. You two went to the beach?

337
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,031
Wait. Weren't we supposed

338
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:41,573
to go with our roommates?

339
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,721
- But Seoyeon...
- -The date right?

340
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:47,501
She invited Mirang on a 1:1 date

341
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,029
- instead of her roommate.
- You invited Mirang on a date?

342
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,398
Mm.

343
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,133
So the two of us went out together.

344
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,108
What did you buy?

345
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:59,331
- I bought a spicy sujebi.
- The spicy one looks delicious.

346
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,396
And kalguksu and that.

347
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,120
This is the squid pancake.

348
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:06,214
They said it's the most famous.

349
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:07,613
(Dagyo & Heeyoung prepared
a variety of Korean food)

350
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:10,626
And bought two so we can share.

351
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:13,251
We also worked hard on

352
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:15,399
a three-layer bear cake.

353
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:16,866
- It used to be 3 layers?
- I...

354
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:20,159
(The cake that used to be 3 layers(?))
But I drove recklessly, and it fell.

355
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,726
I accidentally dropped the cake.

356
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:27,363
So Jinah helped.

357
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:30,419
- She fixed it like this.
- Exactly.

358
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,878
That's how I survived.

359
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,242
(Jinah who devoted herself to
saving the number one cake)

360
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,106
And this tangerine pie?

361
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:38,413
We made it ourselves!

362
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,891
It's pretty!

363
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:49,858
(Food that is full of Jeju's feelings
that come together)

364
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,675
Let's cheers.

365
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:54,158
Cheers.

366
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,314
Thank you.

367
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,238
(Thanks for the trouble)

368
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:06,030
This is wine, we have to swirl it.

369
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,670
- Since it's wine.
- So delicious.

370
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,044
This one's chicken breast,

371
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:11,767
this is spam. Which is which?

372
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,058
This one's chicken breast, this is spam.

373
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,427
(Jinah tries the Vietnamese
spring rolls first) Which one is spam?

374
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:20,828
(Satisfied)

375
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:24,443
(Nom)

376
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,651
(Minwoo dips the Vietnamese spring roll in
homemade sauce and hands it to Heeyoung)

377
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:29,069
Thank you.

378
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,367
(The result of the evaluation
of Vietnamese spring roll is?)

379
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,418
The taste of nature is so good.

380
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:41,482
- You have to dip this in sauce.
- The sauce is really delicious.

381
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,811
You can make a good sauce now.

382
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,553
- How do you make the sauce?
- It's really delicious.

383
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:46,724
It's exactly like the sauce

384
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:48,346
for Vietnamese spring roll.

385
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,518
Jinah and Minwoo's

386
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:52,412
Vietnamese spring rolls...

387
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,394
I think that one is the most delicious.

388
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:55,561
They made really good

389
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:57,248
Vietnamese spring rolls.

390
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,811
It's delicious.

391
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:01,751
It's more delicious than
store-bought food.

392
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:07,796
(Vietnamese spring
rolls that everyone likes)

393
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:11,294
That's great.

394
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,690
Delicious.

395
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,735
(Delighted)

396
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,180
(Jinah tries eating dakgangjeong next)

397
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:27,135
- But why are you chewing tangerine?
- Tangerine?

398
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:28,682
Oh, the tangerine in dakgangjeong.

399
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:31,698
- It probably has tangerine in it.
- Really?

400
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,704
What did you do on your date?

401
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,250
We cooked.

402
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:42,420
Cooking as a date?

403
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:45,809
How did you cook together?

404
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,376
It was great.

405
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,857
We've actually gotten closer.

406
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,694
- We got closer when we cooked.
- Yeah, right.

407
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:54,354
But I want to go outside.

408
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,744
I just really want to go out so bad.

409
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,804
But I like staying here
with Minwoo today.

410
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:00,399
Just feel comfortable.

411
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,142
Minwoo and I... I don't know.

412
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,439
It was great.

413
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:05,840
- Wait, do you like Minwoo?
- I think I do.

414
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:08,871
- So you like Minwoo.
- No, no.

415
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,510
Got cornered.

416
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,813
Should've covered your mouth.

417
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:18,078
Where did Dagyo go today?

418
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,034
As I said earlier, I went to the beach.

419
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:22,687
I want to go to the beach.

420
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,327
The weather is nice today.

421
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:26,708
There are windmills like this.

422
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,050
- The glittering waves were so pretty.
- Yes, yes.

423
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:31,318
What about Mirang and Seoyeon?

424
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:34,978
We made a cake and a pie.

425
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:37,886
Did you make them together?

426
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,411
Yes, we made them together.

427
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,792
But I'm curious.

428
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,891
There's this matter.

429
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,996
Liking someone as a human being,

430
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:48,211
especially among women,

431
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,402
wanting to date rationally,

432
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,078
what's the difference?

433
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,632
I'm curious about it too.

434
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,931
That's why I asked.

435
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,616
I'm very curious about it.

436
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:57,869
My standard is.

437
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,086
‘Do I wanna kiss them or not?'

438
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,519
- Skinship.
- Mm. Exactly.

439
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:05,882
Not on the cheeks, but on the mouth.

440
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,121
Just kissing shouldn't be a criterion
for more than that.

441
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:10,614
Kissing?

442
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:11,919
(Looks)

443
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,449
- Kissing?
- More than that?

444
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,913
- More than that?
- Mouth to mouth.

445
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,982
(Shy)

446
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:18,040
This manly woman.

447
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,117
You said it yourself and blushed.

448
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,233
What? Where did your imagination go?

449
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,001
You must be able to...

450
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,071
After the kiss, where did
your imagination go?

451
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:27,414
- To that step.
- Your face is the same color

452
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,453
as a strawberry.

453
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,096
Can you do it?

454
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,953
- Or can't do it because you're drunk?
- I really think so.

455
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:33,499
Are you blushing because
you're actually embarrassed?

456
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,692
Anyway, I'm curious about
other people's criteria.

457
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,525
It seems similar to mine.

458
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:40,206
For me, it's confusing with women.

459
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,539
The lines blur.

460
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:43,712
Not for me.

461
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:45,360
So what kind of criteria is it?

462
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,971
- Just...
- I can tell.

463
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:50,477
I know if it's someone I like.

464
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:52,444
(Aha)

465
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:53,812
Liking someone as a friend

466
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:55,345
or liking someone because they're

467
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,050
someone I'm interested in.

468
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,971
I think in my criteria, I express a lot.

469
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:04,503
But when I don't know what women like...

470
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,522
So if I'm not sure, I won't like then.

471
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,787
If the other party doesn't
know about that.

472
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,195
That's why I've never
liked hetero before.

473
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:14,173
I only like women who like women.
I'm the same.

474
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:18,088
- Never.
- I've never liked hetero either.

475
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,370
But there aren't many people like that.

476
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:20,717
Age preference?

477
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,618
Older, same age, or younger?

478
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,936
I like older people the most.

479
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,438
Then the same age and then younger.

480
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,172
- What about you, Heeyoung?
- Me?

481
00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:31,125
I don't know much about you.

482
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,470
What's the question?

483
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:34,664
I want to know what kind

484
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:35,990
of people you like.

485
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:37,661
Like, 'this kind of feeling.'

486
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:39,709
Like, some people just know their path

487
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,174
but stand out from the crowd.

488
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:43,052
'Meet naturally.'

489
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,640
But how can we meet naturally

490
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:46,957
without encountering hetero?

491
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:48,571
Right. That's amazing.

492
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,509
Do I express that clearly?

493
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:53,403
Am I obvious? Or am I not?

494
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:55,023
I was amazed just now that you said

495
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,357
you've never encountered hetero.

496
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,107
That's right, and I want to

497
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,788
know your type, Heeyoung.

498
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:04,061
- Do lesbians know and approach you?
- Yes.

499
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,090
You two sound exactly alike.

500
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,791
So vague about your type.

501
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,503
You only said it's someone you like.

502
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,364
But the people I've been with

503
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,066
until now are all different.

504
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,268
Because these two people are so similar.

505
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:16,212
I don't know.

506
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,410
Just meet naturally.

507
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,977
But what's clear is that

508
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:22,563
they all like me.

509
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:25,803
Did I die because of Park Heeyoung?

510
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:27,924
Someone who makes me feel like

511
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,745
they are sincere.

512
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:33,012
What about Minwoo?

513
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:34,992
Did everyone die because of Son Minwoo?

514
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,456
No, I made them die.

515
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:37,811
(Make a fuss)

516
00:21:37,812 --> 00:21:39,740
So fun.

517
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:41,735
How?

518
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:43,913
Me? It's a secret.

519
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,500
- It's a secret?
- It's my own recipe.

520
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:50,080
- Can't you share?
- Absolutely not.

521
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,322
(A night for women to)
A technique

522
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,360
(get to know each other more deeply)
that no one knows.

523
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:58,322
(Continued with the second snack party)

524
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:03,005
(The inner feelings of getting to know
each other a little better jenga)

525
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,729
Let the bravest...

526
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,755
Let the cutest pick first.

527
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:09,643
- The cutest?
- Let the cutest pick first.

528
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:13,244
(Abruptly)
Yourself?

529
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,065
Isn't your butt right in front

530
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,269
of my face?

531
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,081
This is temping.

532
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,763
- Seducing.
- Her butt was right in front of me.

533
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:26,158
My question is...

534
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:28,288
The question I got is,

535
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:30,954
what was my most painful love?

536
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:35,223
The most painful love in my life is

537
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,041
the first love that I had

538
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,454
the longest relationship with.

539
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:44,030
Why did it hurt?

540
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:46,817
Because I loved them the most.

541
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:50,707
- How long was the relationship?
- Three years.

542
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,053
- Is this your longest relationship?
- Yes.

543
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,287
Alright, next. Let the cutest one pick.

544
00:22:57,483 --> 00:23:00,148
- I'll choose it myself.
- I'll pick it myself.

545
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:05,910
I didn't know Heeyoung would pick it.

546
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:08,912
I think it's a contagious disease.

547
00:23:08,913 --> 00:23:11,102
Cuteness disease?

548
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:15,057
10 years older or younger?

549
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,073
I don't care about age,

550
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,860
they're the same.

551
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:23,686
- What if you had to choose?
- What if you had to choose one?

552
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:28,210
Older by 10 years. Wiser, probably.

553
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:30,571
- Younger by 10 years...
- I think so too.

554
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:32,094
Because the possibility is higher,

555
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:33,322
I choose older.

556
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:36,317
Who is the cutest number three?

557
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:37,699
Me.

558
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,788
I knew it would be like this.

559
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:42,377
I'll pick it now.

560
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:48,943
Forgiving a cheating partner

561
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,555
or being forgiven for cheating?

562
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,781
Very difficult.

563
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:54,542
I think forgiving them

564
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:56,083
is slightly better.

565
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:00,166
'I cheated and was forgiven.'

566
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,633
I think I would feel so guilty that

567
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,733
I couldn't be with the other person.

568
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:07,140
As for 'I forgive my lover who cheated.'

569
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:08,908
Even though it's hard for me,

570
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,884
when I think about it,

571
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,125
since it's something I chose

572
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:13,512
and it's good for the other person,

573
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,171
I don't think I'll regret it.

574
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:19,067
I don't care if they cheat.

575
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,842
- Why?
- Really?

576
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,299
Why? Why?

577
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,466
Because if I like someone,

578
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,956
I assume they'll choose me back.

579
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,850
- With that determination.
- I want to throw all

580
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:33,410
my options at them.

581
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:36,505
I don't care who they're dating

582
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:40,870
and it's fine if they'll leave later.

583
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:43,315
- That's just how I am.
- Really?

584
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,796
Hangyeol's answers are always

585
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,976
beyond my wildest imagination.

586
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:48,784
I don't know what she's going to say

587
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:50,169
in that one word.

588
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,196
A world that seems to have

589
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,839
the galaxy is inside.

590
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:57,054
I want to know, ‘What did you say?'

591
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:58,160
'Oh, what does that mean?'

592
00:24:58,161 --> 00:24:59,328
‘What were you thinking

593
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:00,890
when you said that?'

594
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:04,519
That's why I'm amazed.

595
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,893
Next cutie.

596
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:08,709
Me.

597
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:12,128
- Flinch with fear.
- But cute.

598
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:14,858
Choosing with fear.

599
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:15,866
Okay.

600
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,731
When did you realize your sexuality?

601
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,473
I...

602
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:26,317
Went to all-girls school.

603
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,710
Of course, that doesn't matter.

604
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,244
But there are friends around me

605
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:31,704
who are like that.

606
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:35,074
It's just that since I was a kid,

607
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,187
I didn't grow up hearing my parents

608
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:39,700
tell me that things

609
00:25:39,727 --> 00:25:41,248
like that were wrong.

610
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:42,979
In high school, when I received

611
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:45,139
my first love confession from a friend.

612
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,343
It was my first time

613
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:47,633
having a girlfriend.

614
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,204
So then I thought,

615
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:52,376
‘Oh, I can date women.'

616
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:54,082
That was probably my first time.

617
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:56,741
And it was the first time

618
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:57,948
I had a girlfriend.

619
00:25:57,972 --> 00:25:59,523
What about everyone else?

620
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,001
I want to know about this, everyone.

621
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:03,274
I'll ask someone I'm curious about.

622
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,676
Who should I ask?

623
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,326
I want to know about everyone.

624
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,626
Can't you just say it voluntarily?

625
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:13,477
I'll talk then.

626
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:16,163
So cool. Okay.

627
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:21,074
I didn't even realize it.

628
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:22,660
So I didn't have any prejudices.

629
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:25,108
I didn't think about myself at all.

630
00:26:25,147 --> 00:26:26,678
When I was in high school,

631
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,675
I had my first girlfriend too.

632
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:31,998
I realized,
'I can date women too.'

633
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:36,037
Before that, I'd briefly dated guys

634
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:37,309
but always felt something

635
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:38,634
was ‘wrong' with me.

636
00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:41,687
Why friends would swoon over dramas.

637
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:42,848
Why did they fall in love

638
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:44,606
and date with no problems?

639
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:47,079
They all had good relationships.

640
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,786
'Why can't I do it?'

641
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,913
'Why do I break up with
my boyfriend so often?

642
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:52,518
And why I don't feel that way?'

643
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:54,457
'That's my problem.'

644
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,551
Until I dated a woman.

645
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:58,138
'Oh, I'm doing great
with my girlfriend.'

646
00:26:58,162 --> 00:27:02,499
'I missed her but...'
that's when I knew.

647
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,503
Anyone else want to say something?

648
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:08,377
- I...
- I can't break the ties

649
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,474
I've liked women since I was a kid.

650
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:12,915
- How old?
- I think I've liked women

651
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,282
since I was six.

652
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:16,453
I'm really surprised by this.

653
00:27:16,454 --> 00:27:17,702
Even if there were boys and girls,

654
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,963
I wanted to take care of girls.

655
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:22,474
I playfully teased them,

656
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,850
I did something like that too.

657
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,382
In junior high and high school,

658
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,483
I liked both boys and girls

659
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:28,417
at the same time.

660
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:31,732
Then I kept dating men

661
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,259
until I was 22-23.

662
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:35,147
Because I was in denial

663
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:39,137
- that I liked women.
- Yeah, yeah.

664
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:41,476
'Because I've never had skinship
with a man before?'

665
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,113
I've thought about it a lot.

666
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:45,460
And then there was

667
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:47,161
this guy I used to like.

668
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:51,448
But every text from him made me cringe.

669
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:53,235
- I liked him but I didn't like him.
- You liked but didn't like him?

670
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:54,762
I don't like it every morning

671
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,030
if he texts me
‘Did you sleep well?'

672
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,761
- I didn't like it at all.
- Everyday mood…

673
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,280
It's like I had to adjust something.

674
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,010
I felt like this all the time.

675
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:04,370
I get it.

676
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:06,266
I felt like this all the time.

677
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,741
Until a woman confessed to me.

678
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:10,244
So we started dating.

679
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:12,760
I felt good, I was very happy.

680
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,361
That's when I knew, only women for me.

681
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:21,914
(This time it's Jinah's turn to pick)

682
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:23,390
(Oops)

683
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:26,253
A lover who doesn't match in

684
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:27,958
anything except looks

685
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:29,306
or a partner who's perfect

686
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:30,691
except for looks.

687
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:36,971
Very difficult.

688
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,159
So it's are you crazy

689
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,704
about looks or not?

690
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:41,709
I think if they fit together well,

691
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,729
they'll look prettier.

692
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:46,937
- Very pretty.
- Yeah.

693
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:50,129
I have two cats.

694
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,890
The second one I picked it up

695
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:54,982
from the street.

696
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:56,241
It's so ugly.

697
00:28:57,641 --> 00:28:59,049
All cats are cute.

698
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,394
But at one point I saw that

699
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,534
my cat was cute and unique.

700
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:05,406
I love my cat and I can love them.

701
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:08,086
I have a bad side. My lover too.

702
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,188
I think looks don't matter.

703
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,836
But I see my body a lot.

704
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,493
I'll just use this face.

705
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:18,160
- Exactly.
- The first one for me.

706
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:19,951
- What?
- A lover who doesn't match in

707
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,883
anything except looks.

708
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:23,164
A person who matches well in everything

709
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,719
can just be friends.

710
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:29,129
I think that a relationship still needs

711
00:29:29,154 --> 00:29:31,640
to have excitement from looks.

712
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:37,080
So it will be a step

713
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,345
- of accepting feelings.
- That's understandable.

714
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:43,011
I'm wavering. Wavering.

715
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:45,618
(Wavering, wavering)
I'm being persuaded again.

716
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,154
I agree with everything.

717
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:49,327
The latter is too vague.

718
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:51,379
When dopamine is not released,

719
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,419
especially by the same sex,
it will be more severe.

720
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,979
‘Is this a best friend?'
‘Friendship?'

721
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,612
‘Or is it a feeling of love?'

722
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:00,120
I'd like to understand those things.

723
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:03,444
I think I'm the first one.

724
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:06,029
I'm the opposite. Friends

725
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,076
need one common thread.

726
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:10,215
Because I don't have a life where
I have to meet every day,

727
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,124
- even if other things don't match,
- That's correct.

728
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,427
When I need understanding,
when I need this friend,

729
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:15,781
for me, sometimes

730
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:17,541
a lover is my best friend

731
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,003
and sometimes my protector.

732
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,193
So for me,

733
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,467
every part of a lover means a lot.

734
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,745
So we have to get along with every part.

735
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:29,164
Then we can love each other.

736
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:31,772
So I was surprised. But what you said

737
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:32,992
was right, so I was shaken.

738
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:36,160
Seriously.

739
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:39,249
Then if looks aren't your type.

740
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,549
So for Hangyeol, if there's

741
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:43,092
zero physical attraction, it's a no?

742
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:47,062
For me, that'd just be men.

743
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,961
Heart-pounding?

744
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:51,682
Really? That much?

745
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:54,522
I'm really amazed.

746
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:57,164
- Smart answer.
- That's right.

747
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,477
- Wait, I was just wondering.
- I thought you were curious.

748
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:05,266
Who else hasn't picked yet?

749
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,556
Seoyeon is planning to pick.

750
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:08,903
Be careful, it's shaking.

751
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,940
Marriage or cohabitation?

752
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,895
I choose cohabitation.

753
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,155
- What's the reason?
- Marriage...

754
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:24,319
I'm marriage-free by principle.

755
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:27,298
But I don't know what

756
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:28,795
will happen to people.

757
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,262
But I'm not used to saying it.

758
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:33,081
I think it's okay to say it like this.

759
00:31:33,082 --> 00:31:34,635
I think it's okay to say it like this.

760
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:36,707
Then this time, can you point out the

761
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:38,412
person you want to know about?

762
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:41,877
- Dagyo.
- Me?

763
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:46,049
Same-sex marriage isn't legal here yet.

764
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,823
We could do a symbolic ceremony.

765
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,766
But I think legal protections matter.

766
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:54,823
Can I call them that?

767
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,338
Because when looking for a house,

768
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:57,545
you might need a loan
for a newlywed couple.

769
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:59,581
There are legal elements, right?

770
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:01,643
- In that part.
- Become responsible

771
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:04,659
for the part that is required,

772
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,976
I think it should be like that.

773
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,928
Because you can't do that.

774
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:09,887
But I want to have a wedding.

775
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:12,480
I understand that feeling.

776
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:13,921
But isn't it like living together before

777
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,250
marriage and then getting married?

778
00:32:15,274 --> 00:32:16,829
Then get married.

779
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,983
I'll get married.

780
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:19,042
If marriage is legal,

781
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,422
will you get married?

782
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:21,544
I'll get married.

783
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:24,368
I want to get married.

784
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,944
If it's legal, that would be great.

785
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,142
Next, Hangyeol.

786
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,961
Oh, wait.

787
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:38,632
Good job.

788
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:41,090
Partner searches ex's Instagram

789
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,560
or 100 bikini girls?

790
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,256
If we were dating,

791
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:46,523
I'd definitely dislike

792
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,849
the latter option.

793
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:49,147
Because instead of searching

794
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,486
for 100 women in bikinis,

795
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,365
just ask me to wear one.

796
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:55,976
But I don't care about the first one.

797
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,822
Of course, memories pop up.

798
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,510
It's difficult.

799
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:02,025
(Shaken)
I keep changing.

800
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,083
Who do you want

801
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:05,497
to know the answer to? Me?

802
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:07,449
Which is better?

803
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,096
I'd hate the ex search more.

804
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:14,389
- Why?
- Just thinking about it

805
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,354
makes me hate it.

806
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:18,674
- I just don't like it.
- Really dislike it.

807
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:19,965
Really.

808
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,324
Clean breaks only.

809
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:23,729
Why search for an ex's instagram?

810
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,067
I don't like it. If you didn't

811
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:26,966
miss them, why are you curious?

812
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:28,343
But bikini searches could mean

813
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:29,968
they want new women.

814
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:33,547
They can just watch porn.

815
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:35,102
These hot bikini babes

816
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:36,303
have a lower chance

817
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:37,551
of meeting my girlfriend.

818
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:41,750
But my exes had a deeper relationship.

819
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,729
I think I don't like the first one.

820
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,881
- Right.
- I don't like the first one either.

821
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:49,868
I don't mind the first one.

822
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:51,495
And I couldn't care less if they met

823
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:53,371
an ex while we're together.

824
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:56,242
What? Really?

825
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,837
Why is that?

826
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,862
I just have to be confident in myself.

827
00:34:00,863 --> 00:34:03,796
- What confident? Polyamory?
- Wait. Why? Why?

828
00:34:03,797 --> 00:34:06,704
- It's Hangyeol's feelings.
- I think the other party,

829
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:09,544
because we only met when.

830
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:11,740
“I can't not date you”,
I really like you.

831
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:13,147
I think the other party

832
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,761
just came to see me

833
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:16,358
and thought it was better that

834
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:18,199
the other party has all the options.

835
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,950
I don't want to control anything.

836
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:22,897
But now you're comfortable

837
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:24,614
with that, right?

838
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,861
I've always said that

839
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:27,792
I like that kind of relationship.

840
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,825
We're always surprised,

841
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,567
talking about the same thing.

842
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:35,117
Yes, I like this dynamic.

843
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:36,718
That's a self-description

844
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,423
and a persuasion, right?

845
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,290
You could call it persuasion.

846
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,151
When I first heard that answer,

847
00:34:43,171 --> 00:34:45,069
I was like, 'Huh?'

848
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:47,143
But in a way, the way of expression

849
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,528
is rather clumsy.

850
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:52,013
‘Very pure' might be the right word.

851
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:54,379
She's not saying to cheat.

852
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,127
When I saw that positive interpretation,

853
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:01,962
it makes Hangyeol more attractive.

854
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:04,258
Cute people circling again.

855
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:06,009
Cutie, go again.

856
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:08,322
- Look at her face.
- What kind of mouth is that?

857
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,242
Who hit you in the mouth?

858
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,548
Put that mouth inside.

859
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,885
Partner who says ‘I love you' at the end

860
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,604
or partner who ask to say 'I love you.'

861
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:23,838
If I have to choose between these two,

862
00:35:24,384 --> 00:35:25,911
someone who tells me they love me

863
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:28,198
every time they finish speaking.
It's more comfortable.

864
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,860
It's like the freedom of each person.

865
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,031
When I feel that I really love them,

866
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:35,268
I want to say I love you.

867
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:36,535
This one has something

868
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,240
to do with giving back.

869
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:41,679
I don't really feel love from it.

870
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,343
Because I'm like that.

871
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,063
I give without expecting anything.

872
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:48,536
- Well said.
- Good job.

873
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,128
What about you, Hangyeol?

874
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:54,005
I like both.

875
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,833
If I had to choose between the two,

876
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,093
which would I like better?

877
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:05,909
Saying 'I love you.'

878
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:08,532
I like that one more.

879
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,772
I don't really believe in

880
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,473
what I'm asked to do.

881
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,917
Yeah.

882
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:15,407
Very deep.

883
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:18,022
It's like they don't trust me. What?

884
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:21,737
Like I'm doing a little self-reflection.

885
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:26,560
Which one do you like better, Seoyeon?

886
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:30,359
I really want to know.

887
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,723
Asking for love...

888
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:33,876
- Do you like it more?
- Yes.

889
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:37,669
I like people

890
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,220
who want my love.

891
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:44,217
I think so too.

892
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:47,867
If someone says 'I love you' too often,

893
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:51,377
then suddenly stops,

894
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:54,659
I'll wonder, ‘Why not anymore?'

895
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,222
But when I hear it only rarely?

896
00:36:57,223 --> 00:36:58,532
That's when it thrills me.

897
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:00,716
It's really a taste.

898
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:03,928
Asking to say 'I love you, '

899
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,936
is like telling me to try harder

900
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:08,317
because it's an indirect way of

901
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,610
saying that I'm still lacking,

902
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:11,399
so there's an area that I can improve,

903
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,948
- so I like it that way better.
- Me too.

904
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:20,937
- But that's great.
- What is?

905
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,539
After this, I want to assemble again.

906
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,491
Something's coming again.

907
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:26,592
From now on, please reveal

908
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:28,306
your secrets one by one.

909
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:30,764
Ranked by the most curious secret.

910
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,741
(Hangyeol whose age is a secret)

911
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:40,228
(Heeyoung & Minwoo whose
occupations are a secret)

912
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:48,180
(And the women who still don't
know what their secrets are)

913
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:51,099
I'm so excited.

914
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,511
Because everyone wants to
know other people's secrets.

915
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,404
And thinks it will have

916
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:57,218
some influence, right?

917
00:37:57,389 --> 00:37:59,995
I want to know how

918
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,235
that influence will affect me.

919
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:06,101
- Your age is a secret, right?
- My age is a secret.

920
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:07,705
I wonder. Right now, we...

921
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:10,601
- But I want to know the age of both of them.
- We have been together for many days.

922
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:12,753
For me, first of all,

923
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:19,208
We all think,
'She's surely the youngest.'

924
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,294
So we want to know,
‘How young are you?'

925
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:25,626
For me, first of all,

926
00:38:25,627 --> 00:38:26,919
I just turned 20.

927
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,467
(Shocked)
Are you serious?

928
00:38:29,468 --> 00:38:33,502
- What year were you born?
- 06.

929
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:36,510
(Shocked)

930
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:39,228
- The moment I understood everything.
- Suddenly I understood.

931
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:40,680
I guessed that if it was a secret,

932
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:42,219
it'd be in her early 20s.

933
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:45,074
But I didn't think she's 20 years old.

934
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:48,817
If I'd known the cast's ages earlier,

935
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:49,877
If I had known in advance,

936
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:52,248
I wouldn't have hidden it.

937
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,814
- So, actually,
- My heart beats very fast.

938
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:57,324
When I came here, I felt very guilty.

939
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:58,405
I think I'm the one who

940
00:38:58,412 --> 00:38:59,434
feels the most guilty

941
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:02,185
- and very uncomfortable.
- You must feel very uncomfortable.

942
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:05,647
If this is revealed on the last day...

943
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:07,409
'How stressful will it be?'

944
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,836
Because I think this way,

945
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:13,409
I'm relieved that I can now say it.

946
00:39:14,825 --> 00:39:17,013
It must have been very difficult.

947
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:18,244
I've revealed it now.

948
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,614
There's nothing to be afraid of now.

949
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:21,704
I'm just the youngest,

950
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:23,187
just a little kid now.

951
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:26,642
I think it's more comfortable this way.

952
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:29,983
To be honest, I'm relieved.

953
00:39:29,985 --> 00:39:32,399
I didn't care about the response.

954
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,907
But isn't that courage amazing?

955
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:38,215
- To be honest...
- I'd have run away.

956
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:39,559
I'd have run away.

957
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,633
But what I think I'd be really afraid is

958
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:46,659
the decision to

959
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,675
come out in this country.

960
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,639
Because I thought,
'I hope there's no risk.'

961
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,847
Our youngest fought hard.

962
00:39:54,848 --> 00:39:57,981
So proud of you!

963
00:39:57,982 --> 00:39:59,922
That determination was very impressive.

964
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:01,544
I was really shocked.

965
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,072
I think if I were 20,

966
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:05,423
I wouldn't be able to think that way.

967
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,202
If I were to date her,

968
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:09,990
I'd want to guide her

969
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:11,611
to a good direction,

970
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:13,609
That's the mindset I have.

971
00:40:13,898 --> 00:40:16,523
Very young. Very young indeed, but.

972
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,250
But that turned out to be

973
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,294
the charm of being an adult.

974
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,113
At the age of 20,

975
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:25,063
she can endure and do this well.

976
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:26,591
Thinking profoundly,

977
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,932
Will you drown in your own confusion?

978
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:32,200
That maturity, I...

979
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:33,696
I'm just as excited

980
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:35,285
as I am in the house.

981
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,868
Thank you.

982
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:43,378
Drink a bit.

983
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:44,682
When going on a blind date,

984
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:46,349
age is like a profession.

985
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:47,924
I want to hear the secrets of

986
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,070
people who hide their

987
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:50,718
basic information first.

988
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,105
Heeyoung's occupation.

989
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:54,189
- You go first.
- Heeyoung, Heeyoung.

990
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,325
Ah, ahem.

991
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,520
What?

992
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,891
(Curious)

993
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:05,616
(Interested)

994
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:09,078
My occupation is a tattoo artist.

995
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,338
Oh, I got it right.

996
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:12,535
I got it right.

997
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,190
But you guessed almost 100 of them.

998
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:17,284
- 100...
- One of them is right.

999
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:18,714
I asked if there was any in the list.

1000
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:20,522
But she said she couldn't tell.

1001
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:23,162
- I couldn't say because I'm in a show.
- Because it was there,

1002
00:41:23,163 --> 00:41:24,189
if there were none,

1003
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,596
I would've said there was none.

1004
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:38,235
I am currently working
as a tattoo artist.

1005
00:41:38,236 --> 00:41:40,616
7 years in.

1006
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:45,556
On my first trip abroad,

1007
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:47,176
my friend's mother

1008
00:41:47,177 --> 00:41:49,457
had a tattoo of letters on her arm.

1009
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,358
I heard it was the name

1010
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,197
of a child she had miscarried.

1011
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:54,919
I was deeply moved,

1012
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,810
and after that, I chose tattoo.

1013

(Secret of Heeyoung, the tattoo artist)

1014
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:06,054
Because there's a lot of bias

1015
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:07,755
and misunderstanding

1016
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,107
about tattoos and tattoo artists,

1017
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:12,843
after getting to know Park Hee-young

1018
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:15,356
simply as a person

1019
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:16,955
without that bias involved

1020
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,605
I then wanted to talk about my job.

1021
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,183
The truth is, I have a tattoo on my arm.

1022
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,433
No wonder. I wanted to know

1023
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,544
about this so much.

1024
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,503
You can see until here.

1025
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,789
What's up there.

1026
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,902
That you can't roll it up?

1027
00:42:31,903 --> 00:42:33,320
But I really want to know.

1028
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,186
- Sexy, sexy.
- So cool. So cool.

1029
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:36,929
- I travel often for work.
- Oh, tattoo work from overseas.

1030
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,866
I also take jobs in Korea.

1031
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:40,944
That's so cool.

1032
00:42:40,963 --> 00:42:42,364
Is the reason you went overseas

1033
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:44,292
because people were looking for you,
Heeyoung?

1034
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:45,774
Yes.

1035
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:47,118
But sometimes not.

1036
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,907
So I can go where I want.

1037
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:51,184
I have the freedom to travel.

1038
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,540
So if I have a girlfriend,

1039
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,806
when I go to work abroad,

1040
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,859
I will spend time traveling together

1041
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,773
and working like this.

1042
00:42:59,774 --> 00:43:03,142
- That's great.
- I really hope I can do it.

1043
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,770
Yes.

1044
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,098
Thank you.

1045
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:08,561
I'm relieved. Now I can open my arms.

1046
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:09,911
I think it's an opportunity

1047
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,216
to show who I am again.

1048
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:13,857
It feels great.

1049
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,419
No matter how you accept it,

1050
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,210
that's really me.

1051
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,706
When I saw that part,

1052
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,920
I was a bit surprised

1053
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:22,619
because I'm the type of person

1054
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,873
who doesn't really like
people with a lot of tattoos.

1055
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:27,587
Even though I was a little shocked,
my feelings didn't change.

1056
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,383
She travels abroad often

1057
00:43:29,404 --> 00:43:31,084
and lives very freely

1058
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:34,438
in that sense,

1059
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:36,423
I found myself liking her even more.

1060
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,504
I want to be that kind of person too,

1061
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:40,218
and I thought maybe we could talk

1062
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,444
about the future together.

1063
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,922
It's really cool.

1064
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,491
The cutest one.

1065
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,553
What does the cutest person

1066
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:52,655
- do for a living?
- My melody.

1067
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,583

Normally, TikTok creators tend

1072
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,441
to be a bit gloomy,

1073
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:18,934
and seems like they
live a luxurious life

1074
00:44:18,935 --> 00:44:20,421
but are also stuck in the mindset of

1075
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:23,646
‘this is the only thing
I can do with my life.'

1076
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,804
But now, it's not just a choice,

1077
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:31,131
it has become a necessity

00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,792
Majored in aviation,

1081
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:42,438
worked corporate, then entrepreneurship

1082
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:45,633
I'm working as a live creator now.

1083
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:48,870
I crave experience and adventure.

1084
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:51,815
Even though I want stability in love,

1085
00:44:51,816 --> 00:44:54,555
I'm quite determined about it.

1086
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,279
I feel like I want to

1087
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:57,984
experience everything.

1088
00:44:58,313 --> 00:45:02,011
So I'm also very independent.

1089
00:45:02,012 --> 00:45:03,478
And if someone wants to

1090
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:04,892
go abroad with me,

1091
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,761
we can enjoy traveling together.

1092
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:11,715
- That's a plus.
- I want to have many experiences.

1093
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:13,242
While dating someone

1094
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:14,947
who will grow together.

1095
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,568
Why did you change to TikTok?

1096
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:19,268
I think it's a social networking service

1097
00:45:19,293 --> 00:45:20,333
of the future

1098
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:21,975
because the era of social networking

1099
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,199
services has changed.

1100
00:45:23,238 --> 00:45:24,756
The sooner you start,

1101
00:45:24,777 --> 00:45:26,536
the sooner you can grab it.

1102
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,965
Because I wanted to experience quickly,

1103
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:32,914
I've learned a lot from this.

1104
00:45:32,915 --> 00:45:34,851
The news spreads incredibly fast,

1105
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:36,921
since we receive feedback
from all over the world.

1106
00:45:36,922 --> 00:45:40,128
It's not just about gaining benefits
from broadcasting,

1107
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:42,311
but I feel like I can experience
anything through it.

1108
00:45:42,312 --> 00:45:44,272
I think it's a profession full

1109
00:45:44,297 --> 00:45:46,052
of valuable experiences.

1110
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:48,587
I believe TikTok is

1111
00:45:48,614 --> 00:45:50,845
the center of global trends,

1112
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,869
so I'm currently dedicating
myself to studying it.

1113
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,402
- Me too.
- And I think it's a great career.

1114
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:58,221
Thank you.

1115
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,927
I was a bit surprised.

1116
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:05,595
I didn't expect her to think that deeply

1117
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,439
because she's only 20.

1118
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,692
That's the MZ generation for you,
they grasp things quickly.

1119
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:12,774
Interested in the same thing as me?

1120
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:14,314
That's what I'm curious about.

1121
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:17,021
Revealing a secret.

1122
00:46:17,022 --> 00:46:18,389
Dagyo again.

1123
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,224
Not interested.

1124
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:22,053
Riwon stares so intently.

1125
00:46:22,054 --> 00:46:25,234
Heeyoung wasn't there yesterday either,

1126
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:27,215
but guessed correctly today.

1127
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,293
Answered correctly in one go.

1128
00:46:31,294 --> 00:46:33,875
- Tell me the secret.
- What secret?

1129
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,451
My secret is...

1130
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:37,159
(Interested)

1131
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,760
(Concentrate)

1132
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,707
(Attentive)

1133
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:42,121
My secret is

1134
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:43,683
my type.

1135
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:46,467
I wonder why it's a secret?

1136
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:49,052
It's a secret because it's so obvious.

1137
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:50,379
Just in terms of appearance,

1138
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,620
the people I've dated in the past

1139
00:46:52,628 --> 00:46:56,115
have all had double eyelids, high noses,

1140
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:57,569
and well-defined facial features

1141
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:59,029
eyes, nose, mouth.

1142
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,988
And they were all slim.

1143
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:02,318
I've never dated anyone

1144
00:47:02,343 --> 00:47:03,890
who didn't fit that type.

1145
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,658
- What about the length of my hair?
- I've been with all lengths.

1146
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,099
Because I'm determined to date

1147
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,485
people with that kind of appearance.

1148
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:13,521
Coming here, I drop my type,

1149
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:14,731
I want to try to date

1150
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:16,173
without those things.

1151
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:18,288
This is a natural meeting.

1152
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:19,617
Even if someone is interested in me,

1153
00:47:19,618 --> 00:47:21,033
if I say ‘this is my type, '

1154
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:22,240
it might make it hard for

1155
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:23,510
that person to approach me

1156
00:47:23,534 --> 00:47:24,900
if they don't fit that type.

1157
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:27,428
That's why I kept it a secret.

1158
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:30,073
Because you're firm.

1159
00:47:30,128 --> 00:47:31,781
To open up both myself

1160
00:47:31,788 --> 00:47:33,619
and the other person

1161
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:35,971
so we can get to know each other.

1162
00:47:35,972 --> 00:47:37,078
I started to wonder if

1163
00:47:37,092 --> 00:47:38,299
that didn't actually fit me

1164
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:39,834
and it felt good,

1165
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:42,914
because it gave me more opportunities.

1166
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:45,048
I also found myself liking her more.

1167
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,644
Because I'm not that serious.

1168
00:47:48,758 --> 00:47:50,421
That's good.

1169
00:47:50,422 --> 00:47:51,778
My secret is...

1170
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:54,492
(Nervous)

1171
00:47:54,493 --> 00:47:56,563
(Interested)

1172
00:47:56,564 --> 00:47:58,561
(Anticipating)

1173
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,021
I have ADHD.

1174
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:03,659
Really?

1175
00:48:03,696 --> 00:48:06,066
So, when it comes to talking about ADHD,

1176
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,168
it might be because

1177
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:08,396
I have trouble focusing.

1178
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,164
Or another way to put it is

1179
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:11,931
once I become obsessed with something,

1180
00:48:11,938 --> 00:48:13,340
I tend to neglect other things.

1181
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:15,447
In my daily life,

1182
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:16,757
I take a lot of notes,

1183
00:48:16,784 --> 00:48:18,135
so it's manageable,

1184
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:20,930
but still, because of that side of me,

1185
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:22,469
someone I'm in a relationship with

1186
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:23,774
might end up getting hurt.

1187
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:26,349
I suddenly understood that.

1188
00:48:26,374 --> 00:48:28,109
- Well...
- Did something happen?

1189
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:29,355
No. You spilled so much,

1190
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:31,402
and I had to nag you constantly.

1191
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:34,345
You kept forgetting stuff.

1192
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:35,398
Didn't you spill it

1193
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:36,662
on purpose to be cute?

1194
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:39,298
- Did that happen?
- Cute?

1195
00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:42,792
Someone I dated a long time ago

1196
00:48:42,793 --> 00:48:44,053
used to share their worries

1197
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,176
with their friends,

1198
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,494
but not with me.

1199
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:48,389
When I asked them

1200
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:50,083
why they didn't tell me,

1201
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,672
they said, ‘Even if I told you,
you wouldn't remember.'

1202
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:55,803
When he said that, it's not that

1203
00:48:55,817 --> 00:48:57,617
I didn't listen on purpose.

1204
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,204
I just didn't realize it

1205
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:00,422
until that moment.

1206
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:02,480
- That could be a wound in your heart.
- That's right.

1207
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,027
- I think so.
- It could be an opportunity

1208
00:49:05,052 --> 00:49:06,614
to blame yourself.

1209
00:49:06,897 --> 00:49:09,284
I realized it later on,

1210
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:11,351
and I started reading

1211
00:49:11,378 --> 00:49:13,138
a lot of books to fix that issue.

1212
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:14,484
I also developed a habit

1213
00:49:14,505 --> 00:49:16,057
of taking lots of notes.

1214
00:49:16,082 --> 00:49:17,333
I've worked really hard on it,

1215
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,662
and now it has improved a lot.

1216
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:22,177
Doing your best is enough.

1217
00:49:22,178 --> 00:49:25,711
But it's still cool.

1218
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,845
- Thank you.
- I thought she was trying to act cute.

1219
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:31,755
It doesn't feel like a major flaw.

1220
00:49:31,756 --> 00:49:33,698
For some people,
it might be a big issue,

1221
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:35,287
but to me, it's not a big deal.

1222
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,738
It's something that can
happen to anyone.

1223
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:39,217
Next person...

1224
00:49:39,218 --> 00:49:40,980
It's Jinah and Seoyeon left.

1225
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:42,916
Who will speak first?

1226
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:45,766
I want to know Seoyeon's secret.

1227
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:47,821
I don't really know anything about her.

1228
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:49,169
I can't figure it out.

1229
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,326
I really don't know what.

1230
00:49:50,347 --> 00:49:51,853
Seoyeon is thinking.

1231
00:49:51,877 --> 00:49:53,385
No one knows, right?

1232
00:49:53,386 --> 00:49:54,593
Such a strange person.

1233
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:57,445
My secret is...

1234
00:49:57,446 --> 00:50:00,408
I can't put my words together.

1235
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:01,988
If I cry, it's just because I'm sad.

1236
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:03,549
Are you crying?

1237
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,585
- Sorry.
- No need to apologize.

1238
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:11,459
(Tears pour out as if
emotions are raging)

1239
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:17,714
(Worried)

1240
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:23,228
I didn't even know Mirang

1241
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:24,845
had that kind of secret.

1242
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:26,960
I was confused and

1243
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:28,613
assumed things on my own.

1244
00:50:28,637 --> 00:50:30,915
I felt really guilty.

1245
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,555
That's why I got revenge on you.

1246
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:35,151
- That's why I got revenge on you.
- Saying that you're going to get revenge,

1247
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,667
saying that you like me.

1248
00:50:36,691 --> 00:50:40,461
I'm really confused.

1249
00:50:40,462 --> 00:50:43,343
Confusion is revenge.

1250
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:45,841
I want to confuse you.

1251
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,321
Ah, dammit.

1252
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,068
You have to be confused

1253
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:53,477
so it's called revenge.

1254
00:50:53,502 --> 00:50:54,861
If you're feeling comfortable,

1255
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,682
how can you call it revenge?

1256
00:50:56,706 --> 00:50:57,868
Are you acting?

1257
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:00,867
(Seoyeon is angry because she feels
frustrated) Are you an actress? What?

1258
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:03,668
I'm going to make you uncomfortable.

1259
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:12,090
Why today, of all days...

1260
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:13,739
did we have to talk about that?

1261
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,732
If I had just waited a few more hours...

1262
00:51:15,759 --> 00:51:17,099
if I had just held back

1263
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:20,019
for a few more hours...

1264
00:51:20,149 --> 00:51:24,206
I wouldn't have felt this guilty.

1265
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:31,407
(Regret and guilt came
crashing down later)

1266
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:35,313
If I had held it in

1267
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:36,703
just a few more hours,

1268
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:40,050
I wouldn't be feeling so guilty now.

1269
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:45,365
I'm really sad.

1270
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:48,540
Mirang.

1271
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,574
I can't even imagine how

1272
00:51:50,581 --> 00:51:52,811
confused she must've been.

1273
00:51:52,836 --> 00:51:55,161
How confused...

1274
00:51:55,162 --> 00:51:58,095
She told me she was sorry,

1275
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,716
but I didn't know anything.

1276
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:03,583
And I liked it not knowing.

1277
00:52:05,887 --> 00:52:07,879
How confused must she have been...

1278
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,702
when she knew absolutely nothing?

1279
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:16,621
I feel so guilty I'm going crazy.

1280
00:52:18,237 --> 00:52:20,187
Slowly, slowly.

1281
00:52:20,188 --> 00:52:22,417
It's fine.
Can you speak now?

1282
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:23,485
Good, good.

1283
00:52:23,486 --> 00:52:25,693
- Jinah, speak first.
- Me?

1284
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:26,910
This is really funny

1285
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:28,238
but I think this is quite.

1286
00:52:28,262 --> 00:52:29,514
Funny?

1287
00:52:29,515 --> 00:52:31,218
It's actually a very real secret.

1288
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:32,565
It's a real secret that I've been

1289
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:34,087
worried about when I'm dating someone.

1290
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:35,469
I'm the first person in Korea to

1291
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,143
ever appear on a Hetero dating show

1292
00:52:37,168 --> 00:52:39,824
and a lesbian dating show.

1293
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:42,811
The first?

1294
00:52:43,672 --> 00:52:46,142
That hetero, right? The general one.

1295
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:48,046
I've been on both a regular dating show

1296
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:50,320
- and a lesbian dating show.
- Women who aren't lesbians.

1297
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:52,108
When I was an announcer at the airport,

1298
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:53,242
filming a male-female

1299
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:54,769
dating show at 24 years old,

1300
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:55,837
and then 6 years later,

1301
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:57,431
suddenly I'm filming
a lesbian dating show.

1302
00:52:57,455 --> 00:53:00,104
At that time... Then you...

1303
00:53:00,105 --> 00:53:01,579
You?

1304
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,844
And...

1305
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:06,439
I thought it was trot lyrics
or something.

1306
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,149
Dagyo kept looking at me

1307
00:53:08,176 --> 00:53:09,751
with sparkling eyes.

1308
00:53:09,775 --> 00:53:12,617
I've dated both men and women.

1309
00:53:12,618 --> 00:53:15,415
'When did you meet your first lover?'

1310
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:16,476
She was really curious

1311
00:53:16,483 --> 00:53:17,944
but I couldn't answer.

1312
00:53:17,968 --> 00:53:19,442
I came out as heterosexual

1313
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,568
on that previous show,

1314
00:53:21,592 --> 00:53:23,215
and one of my fans,

1315
00:53:23,216 --> 00:53:24,815
when I was dating my boyfriend,

1316
00:53:24,816 --> 00:53:26,892
She was by my side,

1317
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:29,809
a friend and a fan for three years,

1318
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:33,031
but suddenly I...

1319
00:53:33,032 --> 00:53:35,155
feel in love with him.

1320
00:53:35,156 --> 00:53:36,905
So I confessed my feelings

1321
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,610
to my first girlfriend.

1322
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:40,168
So I...

1323
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,554
Even after drinking three bottles

1324
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:42,772
of soju, I wasn't drunk,

1325
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:44,555
and I told her
I like you being like this.

1326
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:46,679
If I get sick, I want to tell you.

1327
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,933
If I see a place worth visiting

1328
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:49,962
on Instagram, I want to share it
with you and go together.

1329
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:51,962
Your job is really cool.

1330
00:53:51,963 --> 00:53:54,219
There are like eight reasons why

1331
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,508
I love and respect you.

1332
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:56,555
And if the only reason

1333
00:53:56,589 --> 00:53:57,969
we can't be together is gender

1334
00:53:57,993 --> 00:53:59,629
then I don't think gender matters to me.

1335
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:00,480
Let's date.

1336
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:01,950
So that's how I ended up confessing

1337
00:54:01,977 --> 00:54:03,444
and dating my first girlfriend.

1338
00:54:04,294 --> 00:54:08,096
Did you know she liked women too?

1339
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:09,410
I was like a fool who

1340
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,783
didn't think about that.

1341
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:12,824
I had a lot of gay male friends,

1342
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:14,138
but no lesbian friends around me.

1343
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:16,017
And I was always just
working at an airport.

1344
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:18,450
So embarrassingly,

1345
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:20,771
to me, being a lesbian was like...

1346
00:54:20,772 --> 00:54:24,308
'Try speaking a language that
doesn't exist in the world.'

1347
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:25,855
So I really like

1348
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,296
the description of love.

1349
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,488
I'm working on a pansexual YouTube.

1350
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:32,048
Because I want to get married someday.

1351
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:33,515
And I've realized that the sense of

1352
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,895
lifelong stability I want

1353
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:36,565
I find that more in women.

1354
00:54:37,163 --> 00:54:40,443
So in the past, I dated men,

1355
00:54:40,468 --> 00:54:42,144
and I met my first girlfriend

1356
00:54:42,164 --> 00:54:43,507
in my late twenties.

1357
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,348
The prejudice I faced for
that was harsh.

1358
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,515
Everyone...

1359
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,978
- You know what I mean, right?
- Throwing tissues is so much fun.

1360
00:54:48,979 --> 00:54:50,640
I endure and endure.

1361
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:52,271
Now I only date shortcuts,

1362
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:54,139
but there were so many prejudices.

1363
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,576
'Aren't you just projecting
a man onto her?'

1364
00:54:57,577 --> 00:54:58,730
- That's what they say.
- “When we break up,

1365
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,988
you'll just go back to dating men,

1366
00:55:00,012 --> 00:55:03,305
'You're not really a lesbian, right?'
I was told these.

1367
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:04,892
It hurt.

1368
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:06,575
But that...

1369
00:55:06,576 --> 00:55:07,838
because I once came out as

1370
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:08,967
hetero on a previous show,

1371
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:10,704
to me, that feels like

1372
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:12,711
such a distant past.

1373
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:13,797
But women I'm seeing

1374
00:55:13,817 --> 00:55:15,178
whether dating or interested,

1375
00:55:15,202 --> 00:55:16,808
they keep pulling that

1376
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:18,502
past into the present.

1377
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,243
And that makes me really sad.

1378
00:55:20,244 --> 00:55:22,954
So being on this show, whether I end up

1379
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:25,174
with someone or not

1380
00:55:25,175 --> 00:55:27,087
I want it to feel like I'm closing
the chapter on that past.

1381
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:28,614
I want to move forward cleanly.

1382
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:32,086
- That's good.
- I don't want to leave any insecurity

1383
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:33,632
in the heart of the person

1384
00:55:33,646 --> 00:55:35,887
I'll marry someday.

1385
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:38,912
- That's how I feel.
- Good, that's good.

1386
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,230
(Applause)

1387
00:55:42,368 --> 00:55:45,602
I thought that story was so beautiful.

1388
00:55:45,603 --> 00:55:48,256
If it were to be made into a novel,

1389
00:55:48,257 --> 00:55:49,389
I would even think,

1390
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:51,094
'I'm very impressed.'

1391
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,142
So I genuinely thought it was beautiful.

1392
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:58,042
Our king.

1393
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,400
My secret is...

1394
00:56:02,348 --> 00:56:03,711
What is it?

1395
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:06,136
- What is it?
- I'm so curious.

1396
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:08,926
With Seoyeon, it feels like

1397
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,356
there's a big story behind her…

1398
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,546
It is a matter that cannot be

1399
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,680
predicted and asked casually.

1400
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:16,280
So I couldn't predict anything at all.

1401
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:23,015
I...

1402
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:26,921
(The winning team returns to
their accommodation after the ceramic date)

1403
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:29,448
I asked others about
the first impression.

1404
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:30,861
No one's ever told me.

1405
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:32,499
I didn't hear it.

1406
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:36,402
What was the first impression of me?

1407
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:37,889
What was the first impression of me?

1408
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,021
I really want to steal that face.

1409
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:44,988
Don't steal faces.

1410
00:56:45,013 --> 00:56:47,296
How about you try stealing that woman?

1411
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:51,425
(Shy)
No, like...

1412
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:54,100
There's this word people use lately,

1413
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:55,452
'chugumi' a person's desired aesthetic.

1414
00:56:55,456 --> 00:56:56,956
There are people who are like the

1415
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,738
standard of appearance that one seek.

1416
00:56:58,777 --> 00:57:00,531
I want to throw away all

1417
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:02,596
the clothes that I brought.

1418
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:04,375
To be really honest,

1419
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:07,837
if Heeyoung were a girl group member,

1420
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,810
I would've collected her photo cards.

1421
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:11,076
(Impressed)

1422
00:57:11,077 --> 00:57:13,276
I have to make a photo card for you.

1423
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:14,869
What to do...

1424
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,801
Why all of a sudden...

1425
00:57:18,057 --> 00:57:20,608
What do you want?

1426
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,891
- I just don't want to talk about it.
- Today is a team like this.

1427
00:57:22,892 --> 00:57:25,450
(Today's date is like fate in many ways)
It must be fate too.
