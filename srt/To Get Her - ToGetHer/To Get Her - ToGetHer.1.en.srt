1
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,409
I want love

2
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,878
that's cute and romantic.

3
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,834
I want love

4
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:04,256
that's organic and cute
that I can be upfront about.

5
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,952
I want love that

6
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:09,684
sometimes feels like family,

7
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,653
sometimes feels like friendship,

8
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:14,075
that comes with sweetness and cuteness.

9
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:19,443
I want to date someone serious

10
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:21,311
who can look to the future.

11
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,052
If there's someone I really like,

12
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:27,217
I want to create good memories there.

13
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:32,349
I was worried I might miss my soulmate

14
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:34,874
and I didn't want to have
any regrets, so I came.

15
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:39,694
I wanted to give myself some confidence

16
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:44,116
and find honest love,
so I came on this show.

17
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:52,014
(Seven women are gathering
to find love.)

18
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:57,452
(Will the romance they've been
dreaming of happen here?)

19
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,470
I'm adamant about things
that will make her truly happy.

20
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:15,800
I want love that doesn't come
with a question mark.

21
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,814
I've been told the smile in my eyes
is beautiful when I smile.

22
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,066
I want love that's romantic on the Jeju Island.

23
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,220
I will always make her happy.
I won't make her regret dating me.

24
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,329
I will do my best until the very end

25
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,220
in order to get her.

26
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:41,767
I won't back down.

27
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:46,820
The looks in their eyes.
I'm usually attracted by these things.

28
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,447
If she smells nice,
I will have a good feeling about her.

29
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,306
She'll definitely date me.

30
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:02,650
(They meet for the first time
through voices.)

31
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,556
(Will these voices result in
the fate I've imagined?)

"ToGetHer"
(Episode 1)

33
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:35,510
(The starting place of their special love)

34
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,868
(ToGetHer House 1)

35
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:41,305
(ToGetHer House 2)

36

(ToGetHer House)

37
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:57,136
(I've been told
I smile with excitement.)

38
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:19,839
All right.

39
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:30,384
(The area for the first meeting
in ToGetHer houses)

40
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:35,557
(Living room, ToGetHer House 1)

41
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:47,357
(Looking around)

42
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,174
(Excited)

43
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,494
I'm someone who
falls in love at first sight.

44
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,469
I will never confuse her.

45
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,454
I'm someone who will do everything

46
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,698
to try to get her.

47
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,657
People may view me as a confident

48
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,938
and feminine woman,

49
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:14,448
but I'm actually very chill.

50
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:18,384
People say I'm different
from their first impression of me.

51
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:22,524
I like someone I find
petite and cute at first glance.

52
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,932
Like a fairy.

53
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:27,674
Someone who just sinks
into my chest when I hug her.

54
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:31,721
It'll be even more fun
with competitions.

55
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,555
To see the person I like smile

56
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,629
is probably my reason for wanting to date.

57
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:40,073
(Riwon)

58
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:49,926
(Peeking)

59
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:54,893
(ToGetHer House Rules)

60
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,309
(During your stay,
the rules must be followed.)

61
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:06,673
The house is very beautiful.

62
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,841
I'm excited.

63
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:22,726
(Pawing)

64
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:26,836
(Clicking)

65
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,660
I'm adamant about things

66
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:30,285
that will make her truly happy.

67
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,915
I've been told the smile in my eyes
is beautiful when I smile.

68
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:36,841
I will do my best until the very end.

69
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,505
The looks in their eyes.

70
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,791
I'm usually attracted by these things.

71
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:44,625
They sound slightly different.

72
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,145
And I can feel
the personality of the speakers.

73
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:53,244
So I'm even more curious
how they'll be like.

74
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:57,395
I'm parched.

75
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:07,117
(Opening gently)

76
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:09,328
(Looking)

77
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,664
(Unreasonably suspicious back)

78
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,390
(Paddling)

79
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,491
(Knocking)

80
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,343
(Knocking)

81
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:31,623
(Surprised)

82
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:39,494
(ToGetHer House's second guest)

83
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:43,315
(Getting up abruptly)

84
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,463
Uh, hello.

85
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,055
Pleased to meet you.

86
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,260
You probably should reading this first.

87
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,741
I can't tell you my name?

88
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,421
- Are you alone?
- Uh, name...

89
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,540
Yes, I came alone.

90
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:06,632
(Smiling)

91
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:14,853
(Nervous)

92
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:19,040
(The aura of shyness between the two)

93
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:22,890
She's a lot prettier than I expected,

94
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:25,212
so I just froze.

95
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,657
Uh...

96
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,773
Yes.

97
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,382
Maybe we have to wait
until everyone's here.

98
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,209
But we can introduce ourselves.

99
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,294
Yes, you're...

100
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:43,959
I'm Park Heeyoung.

101
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,078
I'm Riwon. Kim Riwon.

102
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,918
Heewon?

103
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,640
- Young.
- Heeyoung.

104
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,913
Nice to meet you, Ms. Heeyoung.

105
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,060
People say when they I first saw me,

106
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:02,351
I looked cold and aggressive,

107
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:05,412
but after we met in person,
they said I was more cheerful

108
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,805
and gentle than they'd thought.

109
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,874
My charm is in my bright smiles.

110
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,325
What kind of love?

111
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,515
I used to want to
get to know that person

112
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,734
or feel good when we first meet,

113
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,374
but I never experienced
love at first sight.

114
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,358
I'm someone who the more I observe,

115
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:26,123
the more I become smitten
with that person.

116
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,671
I like someone who's mature

117
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,734
and has inner strength.

118
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,281
If I date someone,

119
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:36,656
I want her to be someone
I can discuss the future with.

120
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:40,906
I want love that feels
fun and comfortable.

121
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,320
(Heeyoung)

122
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,211
(Anxious)

123
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:52,296
(Peeking)

124
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:56,417
Today's not so cold, right?

125
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:58,131
No, it's very nice out.

126
00:10:58,156 --> 00:10:59,156
(Turning)
Yes.

127
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,367
We're not allowed to reveal anything
except our names.

128
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:06,765
So what can we talk about?

129
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,631
Can't share any information.

130
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:12,691
Allowed to reveal only our names.

131
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:14,616
Discuss the Chinese letters in them?

132
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:19,155
What those letters mean...

133
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,981
"Ri" means a village
and "Won" means a rickshaw.

134
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,348
So my friends jokes I'm a village chief.

135
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:28,067
- A village chief.
- Yes.

136
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,535
And your name, Ms. Heeyoung...

137
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,621
"Hee" means...

138
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:37,859
light, and "Young" means fame.

139
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,711
Oh, very good meaning.

140
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,335
My grandfather named me.

141
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,426
Can we really reveal only our names?

142
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,410
So we can only make small talks.

143
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,988
The view of the island is beautiful.

144
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,943
And the accommodation...

145
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:55,699
There's a swimming pool.

146
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:57,113
Very nice.

147
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,596
There's a swimming pool?

148
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,081
Here, a swimming pool.

149
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:05,651
(ToGetHer House 1,
heated swimming pool)

150
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:06,981
Did you bring a swimsuit?

151
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,434
Yes.

152
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,098
A bikini?

153
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,137
Yes.

154
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:14,747
(Pleased)

155
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,059
But I'm shy.

156
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:20,164
Don't like to reveal.

157
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,168
So I'll cover my top.

158
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,568
(Shy)

159
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,754
This is fun.

160
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,229
She's chatty in a very casual way.

161
00:12:31,254 --> 00:12:34,817
I had fun and felt excited.

162
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,135
So it's promising
with nice people here.

163
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,588
(So it's promising
with nice people here.)

164
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:47,721
For me,

165
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,917
as soon as I see that person's charms,

166
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,088
the light in my heart will be turned on

167
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,253
and I'll fall head over heels in love.

168
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,960
As soon as I see the charms

169
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,025
that are unique to that person,

170
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,901
I'll have a good feeling about her.

171
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,315
I like someone with beautiful hands.

172
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,176
I find that sexy.

173
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:15,245
I like someone who's cheerful

174
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,879
with long hair

175
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:19,746
and seems to possess cuteness.

176
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,360
As for age difference, I don't mind
as long as it's not too big.

177
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,515
Not like 12 years apart.

178
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,917
My charm is

179
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,512
attentiveness.

180
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,659
I can take care someone

181
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:34,613
with attention and gentleness.

182
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:38,199
(Seoyeon)

183
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,231
If love triangle happens,

184
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,130
I will fight with everything I've got.

185
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,175
I'll go all out.

186
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,880
Oh, someone's here.

187
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,515
(Excited)

188
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:03,468
What should we do when she comes in?

189
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,523
How should we greet her?

190
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,991
(Worried)

191
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:11,896
(Flinching)

192
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,302
Should we bring her in?

193
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:15,256
Yes.

194
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:20,575
Hello.

195
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,175
Hello.

196
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:23,841
First things first.

197
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,587
Uh, your name is...

198
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,146
For now we can only reveal our names.

199
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:35,798
- Really?
- This...

200
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:38,390
says we can only reveal our names.

201
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:40,738
I'm Seoyeon.

202
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,407
Oh, this is...

203
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:45,705
Your last name's Seo...

204
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,401
No, Kim Seoyeon.

205
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:52,463
I'm Kim Riwon.

206
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:54,556
Kim Riwon.

207
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:55,745
I'm Park Heeyoung.

208
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,542
Heeyeon. Park Heeyeon.

209
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,870
- Heeyoung.
- Young.

210
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,783
Nice to meet you.

211
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:03,206
Nice to meet you.

212
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:04,673
(Speechless)

213
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:07,510
When Ms. Seoyeon came in, it was like...

214
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,869
Her smile was so beautiful.

215
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,924
Oh, wonderful.

216
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:14,824
I made the right decision to come here.

217
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,368
Both of them are very beautiful.

218
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,141
When I made eye contact with them,

219
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,580
at the time, I thought, "Okay."
Just like that.

220
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,307
It was something new and exciting.

221
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:30,893
I suddenly was in a great mood
and my heart raced.

222
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,148
The house is very beautiful.

223
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,706
Really beautiful.

224
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:42,285
Without revealing anything else,
it's hard to start a conversation.

225
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,674
But with you here, it's a lot better.

226
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,868
It's like the pressure dissipated.

227
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:50,165
We had to rack our brains
to start a conversation.

228
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,228
We didn't know what to do.

229
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:55,734
So she asked about the meaning
of the Chinese letters in my name.

230
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,026
Well, we can only reveal our names.

231
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,393
So we can't reveal our MBTIs.

232
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,469
Oh, probably not.

233
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:06,846
Because only our names are allowed.

234
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,993
Have you read that?

235
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,096
No.

236
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,902
Randomly pick two people
to make breakfast tomorrow.

237
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,559
Probably a random rotation
for making breakfast.

238
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,582
But does the...

239
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,365
random selection mean secretly flirting?

240
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,052
Like two people cooking together.

241
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:33,481
But with the random selection,
if one of them can't cook,

242
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,527
it may cause rifts between them.

243
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:38,731
Like me who cooks like once a year.

244
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,706
Well, I'd...

245
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:44,385
look up recipes online
and help each other.

246
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,950
I'm not good at it either,
but we can do it.

247
00:16:47,536 --> 00:16:48,549
Yes.

248
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,514
As long as it's edible.

249
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,956
True.

250
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,832
Oh, well.

251
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,505
Did you bring a swimsuit?

252
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,765
Of course.

253
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,766
But with swimming, I'm like clams.

254
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:01,993
- You like them?
- Clams?

255
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:04,102
I like to soak at the edge of the pool.

256
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,890
I prefer clinging there
to actual swimming.

257
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:09,430
- Just clinging.
- Soaking my feet.

258
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,305
Uh, where were we?

259
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:13,618
A bikini?

260
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,032
No, I'm very shy.

261
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,980
One-piece swimsuit?

262
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:20,840
- Yes.
- It should suit you.

263
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,995
A bikini?

264
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,260
Yes, I brought a bikini.

265
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,435
Wow. Really?

266
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,723
She brought a bikini too.

267
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,406
Seems like you like bikinis.

268
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,431
No.

269
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:33,290
You just gave me a thumbs-up.

270
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,931
(Shy)

271
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,810
The fourth one should hurry.

272
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:49,412
(Followed by
the arrival of the fourth guest)

273
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:52,248
Goodness.

274
00:17:58,701 --> 00:17:59,868
No.

275
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:01,131
So heavy.

276
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,255
All right.

277
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:21,178
Finally.

278
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:23,224
Oh.

279
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,958
- She's here.
- The fourth.

280
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,990
Should we bring her in?

281
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,661
(Looking forward)

282
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:30,761
(Excited)

283
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,388
- Hello.
- Hello.

284
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:44,245
- Are we sit here?
- Yes.

285
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:45,560
I guess.

286
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:51,357
(Paying attention)

287
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,953
We can only reveal our names.

288
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,008
I see.

289
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,353
And the house rules are over there.

290
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,906
I think I'm a coaxer.

291
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:06,398
If I want to be close to someone,

292
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:09,172
I'll open up to them
more than I do anyone else.

293
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:11,001
So my friends say

294
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,798
they feel like being matchmade.

295
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,181
I'm probably someone like that.

296
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,420
When I'm in love, I'm straightforward

297
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:20,545
and I go all in.

298
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:25,680
I want my sweetheart
to make me feel comforted

299
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:28,355
and at ease.

300
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,794
That will make me happy.

301
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,875
I like someone who seems nice.

302
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,595
And physically is strong.

303
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:40,172
If I meet someone I like,

304
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:43,101
I want the kind of love I dream about.

305
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,869
I want love that allows us

306
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:47,753
to look to the future together.

307
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:52,507
(Jinah)

308
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,050
What's your name?

309
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:59,093
I'm Jinah. Kim Jinah.

310
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,304
It's her voice.

311
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,190
- Whose voice?
- The voice that sounds sweet.

312
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:07,713
- Me? No.
- Sweet voice like a newscaster.

313
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:09,939
- You remember all the voices?
- Yes.

314
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:12,909
There was one voice that stuck with me.

315
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,310
Can you say your name again?

316
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,865
Kim Jinah.

317
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,603
The name really suits you.

318
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:19,985
Suits the short hair too.

319
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,758
This is the first time ever

320
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:23,970
that I keep my hair this short.

321
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:25,940
In the past, I always had long hair.

322
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,978
Short hair really suits you.

323
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,110
But it looks very round.

324
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,555
It can be charming.

325
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:35,709
Do you know the pea pod plushies in Daiso?

326
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,105
- The round ones.
- I don't actually.

327
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,645
- That's it.
- But it's cute.

328
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,525
I got a lot of them as gifts.

329
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,870
- I see.
- Because I'm round all over.

330
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,343
(Staring)
I see.

331
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,590
You look like them?

332
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:51,848
Her voice is very pleasant.

333
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:54,190
It's calming, so...

334
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:57,668
I felt excited from that moment on.

335
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:00,915
You're like a newscaster.

336
00:21:00,947 --> 00:21:03,074
- No way.
- Your voice too.

337
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:11,786
(Does the voice they like belong to Jinah?)

338
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:17,351
Wait a minute, you smile like this.

339
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,361
- Perpetual smiley face.
- Right?

340
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:20,530
Like a smiley dog.

341
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:23,561
- A dog's face?
- No, there's that smiley dog.

342
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25,008
(Laughing)

343
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:32,200
Ms. Seoyeon has a face perfect for smiling.

344
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,660
She gives sweet smiles.

345
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:38,731
Heeyoung pretends to not smile a lot,
but when she smiles

346
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,738
with her eyes closed, she's very beautiful.

347
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:43,735
So that moment is very memorable to me.

348
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,802
I started to think
she had a very nice smile.

349
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:50,273
There were a lot of cats on the street.
I mean I have cats.

350
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:51,415
Me too.

351
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,656
- Two.
- Same.

352
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,266
(Cat tattoo)
Here too.

353
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,046
- Oh.
- Very cute.

354
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:57,275
That's it.

355
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:58,734
Do you have a cat?

356
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,614
My mother has a dog.

357
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,515
- Your face is dog-like.
- True.

358
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,051
True, a dog-like face.

359
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,051
(Cat-like face)
Cat-like face.

360
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,488
(Dog-like face)
Dog-like face.

361
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,903
Do you have a cat-like face?

362
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,103
Pea-like face.

363
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,071
- I dug my own grave.
- Rabbit-shaped face?

364
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,195
People say it's a combo.

365
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,455
- Like 50/50.
- Yes. Both dog-like and cat-like.

366
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,894
Like yours is clearly dog-like.

367
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:27,445
(Surely a dog-like face)

368
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:29,760
Ms. Riwon has a rabbit-like face.

369
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:31,180
I've been told that a lot.

370
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,935
People say a rabbit or a cat.

371
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,199
A cat and a rabbit.

372
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:35,874
You look like...

373
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:37,595
Pocahontas.

374
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,862
Pocahontas?

375
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,200
What is it?

376
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,343
Oh, Disney.

377
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:44,088
Disney characters with sharp features.

378
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,150
I like that.

379
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:52,772
And she's dressed fashionably.

380
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,115
And her personality.

381
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,561
So I wonder if she works in fashion.

382
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,686
Well-dressed people
usually prefer dark tones.

383
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:03,133
It's the style I've dreamed for myself.

384
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,084
- I'm never dressed in that style.
- Really?

385
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,757
It's not the style that suits everyone.

386
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:10,150
I don't think it'll suit me.

387
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,500
I'm never dressed like you guys either.

388
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,773
(ToGetHer House's
fifth guest has arrived)

389
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:28,282
(Indelicately)

390
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,836
- Yes, dresses and I...
- Oh, did someone arrive?

391
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:33,204
Someone's here.

392
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:34,595
(Flinching)

393
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:36,291
What should I do?

394
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,331
(Curious)

395
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,158
Is mine too big?

396
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,720
Standing like this feels awkward.

397
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:57,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

398
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:01,809
Hello.

399
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,295
Should I wear the house flip-flops?

400
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:05,527
(Unsure how to act)
Yes.

401
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,584
- Hello.
- Hello.

402
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,344
Hello.

403
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:21,930
Pleased to meet you.

404
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:28,505
Uh, the chairs.

405
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,746
Are they comfortable?

406
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:31,312
Very comfortable to me.

407
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:33,198
I was worried they weren't.

408
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,135
If I have to define myself in one phrase,
it's "a serious bulldozer."

409
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,230
I don't think it matters
how long we've known each other.

410
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,040
I want romantic love.

411
00:24:58,135 --> 00:25:01,335
When I want to get close to someone
or want to approach someone,

412
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
I will become coaxing.

413
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:10,323
If someone feels good about me,
that should be good, right?

414
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,495
Women with childlike qualities.

415
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,043
I'm easily attracted to that kind of women.

416
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:19,648
I will go after someone I like.

417
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:23,035
I want to be completely
honest with my own feelings.

418
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,934
If I like them,
I'll tell them that until the very end.

419
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:32,194
Someday there must be someone
I can call "sister," right?

420
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:39,257
(Hangyeol)

421
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:42,490
(Hangyeol's arrival causes anxiety
in the ToGetHer House)

422
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:44,355
What's your name?

423
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,120
I'm Jeong Hangyeol.

424
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,616
Ms. Hangyeol.

425
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,424
Hangyeol.

426
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,416
Ms. Hangyeol.

427
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:55,294
My heart raced.

428
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:58,719
I knew right away that
it was Ms. Hangyeol's voice.

429
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:01,755
She's attractive.

430
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,778
You can say that.

431
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:06,012
You know the feeling
when we hear someone's voice?

432
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:08,760
She seems to be my type,

433
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,660
which is reserved and quiet.

434
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,183
I'm Kim Seoyeon.

435
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,431
Seoyeon.

436
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,491
I'm Park Heeyoung.

437
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:21,186
I'm Kim Riwon.

438
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:22,687
- Riwon.
- Will you remember?

439
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,859
Will you remember?

440
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,348
I'm good with names.

441
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:28,596
- Really?
- Yes.

442
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:33,992
The most attractive one
is probably Ms. Heeyoung.

443
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:36,093
She has a good body.

444
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:40,312
She looks unique.

445
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:41,788
So I'm charmed by her.

446
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,757
(So I am charmed by her.)

447
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:53,167
I want to hear Ms. Hangyeol's voice.

448
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:55,843
Oh, I...

449
00:26:55,868 --> 00:27:00,368
When I meet someone for the first time,
I tend to stammer.

450
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:04,440
In the beginning, I don't talk much.

451
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:09,493
In the beginning, I didn't want to talk

452
00:27:09,518 --> 00:27:12,110
about myself much.

453
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:16,336
I wanted to feel out the vibes
from other people first.

454
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:21,086
I find that in a big group,
it's best to speaking less.

455
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:26,665
Ms. Hangyeol, you look like a writer.

456
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,150
I can't say just yet.

457
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,493
Wow. So decisive. You must be a T.

458
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,283
You must be a T based on MBTI.

459
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,477
I like to guess.

460
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:38,350
Your MBTI must be I and T.

461
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:40,423
You must be a T based on MBTI.

462
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:00,790
I've been told
I make good first impressions.

463
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:02,735
They say I'm beautiful.

464
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,744
For me,

465
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:09,947
before getting close, I will chat them up
and try to create an atmosphere.

466
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:13,515
I want to meet new people.

467
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,195
I want a lasting relationship,
so I applied to this show.

468
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:21,445
I'll try to express myself
in front of someone I like.

469
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,668
If someone say they like me

470
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:27,030
and I don't reciprocate, I won't be persuaded.

471
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:30,818
If they're ten years older,

472
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,545
I'm fine with that.

473
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,765
I want to date someone serious

474
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,410
who can look to the future.

475
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:44,591
(Dagyo)

476
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:06,627
Oh, looks like someone's here.

477
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,549
(Flinching)

478
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:11,838
(Curious)

479
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:16,495
Or not?

480
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,277
Should I go check?

481
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,684
Oh, she's here.

482
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:25,817
(Shy)

483
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:28,660
She's here?

484
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,871
Is she here?

485
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:31,877
(Surprised)
What the heck?

486
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:34,340
She must be startled.

487
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,503
She was shocked.

488
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:38,214
Her eyes are already big.
They must be bigger now.

489
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:44,172
- Hello.
- Hello.

490
00:29:44,197 --> 00:29:46,231
- Hello.
- Hello.

491
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:48,043
- Hello.
- Hello.

492
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:49,068
Please.

493
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:51,241
- Hello.
- Hello.

494
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:55,389
- Hello.
- Hello.

495
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:56,675
Pleased to meet you.

496
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,400
We can only reveal our names.

497
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:01,880
I see. Let me take off my coat.

498
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,637
Smells so nice.

499
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:09,808
Can you manage?

500
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,113
I'm hot.

501
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Yes.

502
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,175
Did you all introduce yourselves?

503
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,653
Yes, we did.

504
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:30,622
I'm Park Dagyo.

505
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,120
- Da...
- Dagyo.

506
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:34,912
- Gyo. Dagyo.
- Yes.

507
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:42,096
(Still)

508
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,480
Hangyeol was sitting still across from me

509
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,725
so we made a lot of eye contact.

510
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,688
We had just met,

511
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,820
but it felt like I was being courted.

512
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,830
(Hangyeol's suspicious smile)

513
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:02,986
- Can I have some water?
- Oh, this one.

514
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,415
Do you want soda? I haven't opened it.

515
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,775
Thank you.

516
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:16,744
(ToGetHer House's last guest)

517
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:19,835
The confident voice of the person who says

518
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,352
she wants love that doesn't
come with a question mark.

519
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:24,517
That struck with me the most.

520
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:27,307
I wanted to meet that person.

521
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:43,182
Sounds like she's here.

522
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:44,572
Or not?

523
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:54,541
Oh, no.

524
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:57,283
(Interested)

525
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,493
- Hello.
- Hello.

526
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,024
I guess this is the last one.

527
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:04,479
(Nodding)

528
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,924
Hello.

529
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:17,540
People's first impression of me
is that I look chic,

530
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:20,219
speaking coldly,
but once you've got to know me,

531
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:21,704
I'm a coaxer

532
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:24,860
and I'm playful.

533
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:27,266
I tend to be feel good toward people who

534
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,540
take good care of me.

535
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,415
In the past, I dated people

536
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,502
I fell in love with at first sight.

537
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,649
My type is someone gentle

538
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:38,682
who takes care of herself
and has a beautiful smile.

539
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:41,126
Beautiful women are my type.

540
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,844
If I truly love someone,

541
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,236
I also want to marry her.

542
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,244
I think I show more feelings
with someone I like.

543
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:55,055
I want to date someone who can

544
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:57,104
create the future with me.

545
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:03,924
(Mirang)

546
00:33:05,254 --> 00:33:07,260
What's your name?

547
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,893
I'm Kim Mirang.

548
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:10,765
Huh?

549
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:12,444
Kim Mirang.

550
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:13,924
- Mirang.
- Yes.

551
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:16,315
- Rang? I see.
- Yes.

552
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:18,963
Ms. Dagyo.

553
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:21,299
Because she's beautiful and elegant.

554
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:26,141
I think she's the closest to my type.

555
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,125
The ones with the most striking appearance

556
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,955
are Ms. Heeyoung and Ms. Mirang.

557
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:33,890
They're the most eye-catching.

558
00:33:34,775 --> 00:33:37,050
No one knows each other, right?

559
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:38,135
That's right.

560
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,805
This is my first time meeting you guys.

561
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,353
Same.

562
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,310
I know you.

563
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,955
- Huh?
- Huh?

564
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,003
Really?

565
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:48,925
I thought so, that's why I asked.

566
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,505
- YouTube?
- Yes.

567
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,858
I follow your IG too.

568
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:54,165
Really?

569
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,650
My goodness.

570
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,702
I feel like my ears are going red.

571
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:04,847
You're red everywhere.

572
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:08,602
So you don't know each other.

573
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:10,329
- You know her.
- Know who she is.

574
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:11,571
It's one-way.

575
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:12,876
She doesn't know me.

576
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:15,354
- So you must know what I do for a living.
- Yes.

577
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:17,555
- Aha.
- A newscaster.

578
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,494
Probably something like that.

579
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,058
- Something like that.
- Is that correct?

580
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:25,755
(Everyone's notification sound goes off
at the same time in the ToGetHer House)

581
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:27,339
What's that?

582
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,729
(The first message sent to
ToGetHer House's guests)

583
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:30,754
What?

584
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:35,003
(Choose a roommate for your stay)

585
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,590
Oh, a roommate.

586
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:42,605
A roommate?

587
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:47,420
Actually I want to stay
with someone I like.

588
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,096
When we're alone,

589
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:52,019
she can see more of my charms.

590
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,121
Actually I prefer a single room,

591
00:34:57,324 --> 00:34:58,604
but staying with someone I like

592
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,629
or someone I can easily talk to
should be good too.

593
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:03,957
(Thinking hard)

594
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,464
I prefer more people

595
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:11,369
so I don't want to stay in a single room.

596
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:14,121
I want to stay with one or two roommates.

597
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,698
What do I do?

598
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,847
(Who will be each other's roommate?)

599
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:21,496
Can we check it out now?

600
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:25,821
I really want to go.

601
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:27,625
This is house number one.

602
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:30,057
Let's see the rooms, then make a decision.

603
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,441
- Good.
- Good.

604
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:33,996
Let's go.

605
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:44,706
(ToGetHer House 1, ToGetHer)

606
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:51,197
(ToGetHer House 1,
three-people bedroom, first floor)

607
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:53,487
Divided into one and one like this?

608
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:56,660
Very beautiful.

609
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:05,699
(ToGetHer House 1, living room)

610
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:16,457
(ToGetHer House 1, garden)

611
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:18,542
I like this very much.

612
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,066
There's something outside.

613
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:23,941
It should be close.

614
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:27,816
Good shoes are required.

615
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:29,121
It's dangerous.

616
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,842
- Where?
- You don't know?

617
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,816
- It's very famous.
- Of course I know.

618
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,222
You seem to be on TikTok a lot.

619
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:40,879
No, I don't have TikTok.

620
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:42,844
But that one is famous.

621
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,669
- Oh.
- Oh, right next door.

622
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:55,144
Very close.

623
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,181
Number two.

624
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:05,435
The kitchen is so beautiful.

625
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:07,463
That house has it too.

626
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:09,980
But this house is more spacious.

627
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:12,636
Oh!

628
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:16,013
(ToGetHer House 2,
two-person bedroom, first floor)

629
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,878
I like it here.

630
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:20,050
I want to sleep here.

631
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:30,933
(ToGetHer House 2,
two-person bedroom, second floor)

632
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:34,471
Cute.

633
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:35,496
Goodness.

634
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,089
It looks cozy.

635
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:39,471
If you stay with someone you like,

636
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:40,820
this room is perfect.

637
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:42,777
I'd like to call dibs on this one.

638
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,041
I think it will be awkward.

639
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:46,956
I like it.

640
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,167
The kitchen is so beautiful.

641
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,410
But this house is more spacious.

642
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:57,628
Shall we go back?

643
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:05,534
Should we arrange the selection order first?

644
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:09,377
Does anyone have a preference of where to stay?

645
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:12,908
Does anyone have someone
they want to stay with in mind?

646
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:16,315
But we all just met each other.

647
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,572
So what should we do?

648
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:21,183
So can I choose first if no one else can?

649
00:38:21,562 --> 00:38:23,261
Yes, please.

650
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:24,988
That's a good idea.

651
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,002
If I choose first,

652
00:38:28,027 --> 00:38:31,175
then someone choose my room,
that would feel...

653
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:32,775
a lot more comfortable.

654
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,581
So I chose first.

655
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:39,410
- Followed by...
- I want to sleep on the first floor.

656
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,503
- First class - Yes.

657

(Mirang, Seoyeon)

658
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:47,706
I'd like house number one.

659
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,553
- Right here?
- Yes.

660
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,760
(Jinah)

661
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:54,736
- Who else?
- Then I stay there too.

662
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:55,816
Here?

663
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:04,715
Actually I'm very fascinated
with the upstairs bedroom.

664
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,540
- Here?
- Yes, I'll stay there.

665
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
(Riwon)

666
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,543
- Where do you want to stay?
- You go first.

667
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:14,748
I'll take what's left.

668
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:18,433
Then I'll take the second floor.

669
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:20,796
Ah, no, here.

(#2, Two-person bedroom,
first floor, Mirang & Seoyeon)

Which bed would you like?

683
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:06,035
I'd take this one.

684
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,301
I think this room is the best.

685
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,760
It is.

- Ms. Riwon, right?

I'll know them roughly.

729
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:55,328
- An expert.
- Yes.

730
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:57,146
I can just feel it.

731
00:41:57,171 --> 00:41:58,298
So,

732
00:41:58,923 --> 00:42:00,183
why don't you try this?

733
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:02,015
Change your career.

734
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,220
Change my career?

735
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:05,236
Work in something to do with MBTI.

736
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,478
What worries me is...

737
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,187
an important aspect of my type is

738
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:13,555
that have to be an I.

739
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,363
Can I ask why?

740
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,653
I don't know, but I like introverts.

741
00:42:18,678 --> 00:42:20,853
- They're cute.
- Are you an extrovert?

742
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:23,744
Yes, I'm clearly an extrovert.

743
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,814
Do you know that meme?

744
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:29,104
The faces of introverts and extroverts.

745
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,306
- Uh...
- Their eyes are like...

746
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,675
I can kill you but...

747
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:36,127
in a good way.

748
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,369
She's very cute.

749
00:42:38,884 --> 00:42:40,255
If I say this to her,

750
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,633
it might upset her.

751
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:44,916
But she's like a brave kitten.

752
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:48,467
She's someone who should be
able to get along with me.

753
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,119
If that's the case, it'd be nice.

754
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:56,947
(Even though they just met,
both of them get along.)

755
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:01,775
(What will their one-week stay be like?)

756
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:04,195
(#1, three-person bedroom, first floor,
Jinah & Heeyoung & Dagyo)

757
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,190
I feel like I don't have to hang my clothes.

758
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:08,642
Me too. I'll just take out
what I'm wearing the next day.

759
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:11,667
Just take it out whenever you need it.

760
00:43:11,827 --> 00:43:14,679
If I hang my clothes, it will be messy.

761
00:43:14,704 --> 00:43:16,095
So messy I can't clean up.

762
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,706
So have you planned out

763
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:20,931
what you would wear tomorrow
and the day after?

764
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:22,030
- No.
- No, right?

765
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,889
You can figure it out as you go.
You already have an idea anyway.

766
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:29,272
It's different from what I thought.

767
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:31,436
The participants?

768
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:34,785
Everyone is different
from what I had in my head.

769
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:36,498
Ever since hearing their voices.

770
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:37,951
Aha.

771
00:43:38,538 --> 00:43:40,022
- Really?
- What does that mean?

772
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:42,436
- Are you disappointed?
- It's like, "Aha."

773
00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:44,569
I'm gonna change.

774
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,217
Can I sit on the bed?

775
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:47,505
Sure.

776
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,989
But I want to sleep here.

777
00:43:50,014 --> 00:43:51,690
Sometimes if I change sides,

778
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,270
I can't sleep. To get out easily.

779
00:43:53,295 --> 00:43:54,985
I like morning walks too.

780
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,365
- Like grandmas.
- Easy access. Okay.

781
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:01,194
But the houses are so nice I was shocked.

782
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,919
I didn't know each house
would have its own pool.

783
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:06,600
- True.
- I love the water.

784
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,139
Same, I'm like a seal.

785
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:09,579
Are seals good swimmers?

786
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:11,244
- Yes, I like diving.
- Really?

787
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,535
- I open my eyes in the water.
- Really.

788
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,058
But I can't wear contact lenses.

789
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,245
If I knew about the pools,

790
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,790
I would've brought swimming armbands.

791
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:21,086
- I'm not a good swimmer.
- You're not?

792
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:23,598
I'd better take out tomorrow's outfit.

793
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,284
- What will you wear?
- This is

794
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:28,950
the darkest coat I brought.

795
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,475
- Really?
- For real?

796
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,682
Wanna see it? I'll show you.

797
00:44:32,707 --> 00:44:34,066
Completely opposite to mine.

798
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:35,371
Right? A shame.

799
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,165
Your styles are the complete opposite.

800
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,760
But I like the cool-girl style.

801
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,720
You know people dress in the opposite way

802
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,165
of what they want, right?

803
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:48,134
I always say I want cool and sexy women.

804
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,954
If I ask, "I'm sexy and cool, right?,"

805
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,548
my followers will say

806
00:44:52,573 --> 00:44:55,909
she's been insisting that
she's sexy and cool for ten years.

807
00:44:57,063 --> 00:44:59,204
Everyone is very friendly.

808
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,268
Everyone gets along.

809
00:45:00,293 --> 00:45:03,266
We've talked about something serious too.

810
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,790
We three got to stay

811
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:06,259
together by chance,

812
00:45:06,284 --> 00:45:09,345
so conversations come naturally.

813
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:11,501
We're very friendly

814
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:14,640
so it allows us to open up a lot
from the first day.

815
00:45:21,315 --> 00:45:23,405
I thought Jeju Island would be cold,

816
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:25,852
so I brought padding.

817
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:27,401
But if I wear padding

818
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:30,030
on a date, it doesn't look as nice.

819
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:31,284
Really?

820
00:45:31,784 --> 00:45:33,730
I have two options.

821
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,634
One is dress well, two is

822
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:37,539
dress freely.

823
00:45:37,564 --> 00:45:39,534
It shouldn't be so bad.

824
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:43,838
(Awkward)

825
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:48,354
Unpacking with someone I just met is...

826
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:52,737
strange.

827
00:45:56,851 --> 00:46:02,335
To be honest, I don't know how to act
when I'm around someone I like.

828
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,501
We don't know each other well yet.

829
00:46:04,526 --> 00:46:08,490
So I want someone
who I can be comfortable with.

830
00:46:12,462 --> 00:46:14,662
Take a break. You must be tired.

831
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,604
Oi, I feel like dying.

832
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:21,465
Have you met someone you like, Ms. Mirang?

833
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,885
Me?

834
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:24,487
I think so.

835
00:46:24,512 --> 00:46:26,018
- Really?
- Yes.

836
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:29,870
- So cool.
- But we...

837
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:32,089
just met each other.

838
00:46:32,114 --> 00:46:34,401
That's true. We all just met.

839
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,878
It may not be

840
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,650
the feeling of love.

841
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:40,525
- Good feeling?
- Yes, maybe

842
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,940
having a good feeling
toward someone is good enough.

843
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:44,694
Do you feel it?

844
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:45,901
Yes, I do.

845
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:48,129
Everyone has good news.

846
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,886
What is this?

847
00:46:50,378 --> 00:46:51,829
I was most worried about that.

848
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:52,890
That I wouldn't feel it.

849
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,930
- Me too.
- Is your type rare?

850
00:46:55,117 --> 00:46:58,339
No, my type isn't that rare.

851
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,150
But people around me,

852
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:02,408
there aren't... Well...

853
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:04,790
You mean opportunities to meet someone.

854
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:07,401
- Yes, something like that.
- The frequency?

855
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,683
Yes, that's why.

856
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,030
I was worried they wouldn't be here.

857
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:14,739
Worried they wouldn't be here.

858
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:16,464
- Worried they wouldn't be my type.
- Yeah?

859
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,620
Because we don't know
each other's preference yet.

860
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,070
I'm curious about that.

861
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,190
Most curious about that.

862
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,440
Do preferences matter to you?

863
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,815
I think they do.

864
00:47:31,107 --> 00:47:34,347
Because some people like long hair.

865
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:38,447
You like older or younger women?

866
00:47:39,003 --> 00:47:41,190
I used to like older women.

867
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:43,988
But now there aren't many of them,

868
00:47:44,013 --> 00:47:46,173
so I've only dated younger women.

869
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,596
But younger women have their charms.

870
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:55,044
(What about you?)
It's a secret.

871
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:57,228
Damn, you're messing with me.

872
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:59,479
I'm the only one divulging again.

873
00:48:04,636 --> 00:48:05,878
That's funny.

874
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,636
I think other people are probably

875
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:11,597
putting on makeup.

876
00:48:12,453 --> 00:48:14,154
Do I have to? I don't wanna bother.

877
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:15,548
How...

878
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:18,417
They won't be interested
in each other anymore I guess.

879
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:20,707
Are you a realistic person?

880
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:22,167
Yes, I'm realistic.

881
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,979
What is that pink thing?

882
00:48:31,004 --> 00:48:32,323
- Huh?
- What is that pink thing?

883
00:48:32,348 --> 00:48:34,300
Neck massager.

884
00:48:35,698 --> 00:48:36,807
Cool.

885
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,472
This room is good
for changing activities because...

886
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:43,229
It may be a disadvantage,
but also an advantage.

887
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,542
I like it.

888
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:46,862
I like that it's warm.

889
00:48:48,964 --> 00:48:50,690
If my roommate likes it,

890
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:52,393
I like it too.

891
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:55,091
I like it too.

892
00:48:58,439 --> 00:48:59,485
Ms. Hangyeol.

893
00:48:59,517 --> 00:49:01,244
- Yes.
- Come down, please.

894
00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:04,672
You guys are so light-skinned.

895
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:05,757
Both of you.

896
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,690
But our styles are very different.

897
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:09,148
You have a dog-like face.

898
00:49:09,173 --> 00:49:11,167
Clearly a dog person.

899
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,055
But on this side,

900
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,945
I can smell strawberry-flavored milk.

901
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,545
Strawberry?

902
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,284
- A pink top.
- Strawberry-flavored milk.

903
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:22,030
Strawberry-flavored milk.

904
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:26,347
The two of you are like cream cakes.

905
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:30,916
Ms. Hangyeol, you're like espresso.

906
00:49:31,604 --> 00:49:33,220
Thank you.

907
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,620
This is your style, right?

908
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:36,225
Yes, something like that.

909
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,765
But actually,

910
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,310
I prefer decaf.

911
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:44,289
Does caffeine make you feel bad?

912
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,972
I don't like anything that stimulates me.

913
00:49:48,252 --> 00:49:50,283
You like things that are calming, don't you?

914
00:49:50,308 --> 00:49:51,494
Caffeine...

915
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,447
I like the taste of coffee,

916
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:55,986
but afterward I'll feel...

917
00:49:56,018 --> 00:49:57,385
kind of hyper.

918
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,479
- Yes.
- I will speak super fast.

919
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:02,704
I'd love to see you when you're drunk.

920
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:05,144
If I'm drunk,

921
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:07,604
I think it would be funny.

922
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:09,978
Yes, I'd love to see when she's drunk.

923
00:50:10,018 --> 00:50:12,414
People who don't like losing focus.

924
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:14,331
- What are they like when drunk?
- Yeah.

925
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:18,620
I don't like anything that makes me lose focus.

926
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:21,812
You are beautiful.

927
00:50:21,837 --> 00:50:22,937
You are beautiful.

928
00:50:26,636 --> 00:50:29,589
You praise people's beauty very casually.

929
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:32,394
I don't say that to just anyone.

930
00:50:33,054 --> 00:50:35,087
You two have a habit of praising people, right?

931
00:50:35,112 --> 00:50:36,822
Praising machine.

932
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:39,954
I like praising people,
but I don't do it if I don't feel it.

933
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:42,933
I can't tell people
they're beautiful if they aren't.

934
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,213
I believe that.

935
00:50:46,283 --> 00:50:48,269
I think you two are really beautiful.

936
00:50:49,753 --> 00:50:51,473
I speak from my heart too.

937
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:53,831
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.

938
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,042
Everyone is better-looking than I expected.

939
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:06,556
- True.
- I arrived first, so I saw everyone.

940
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:09,088
I kept thinking, "Oh, oh, oh."

941
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:11,823
What did you think before you came on?

942
00:51:11,941 --> 00:51:13,961
I didn't expect much.

943
00:51:14,173 --> 00:51:15,973
Why not?

944
00:51:16,975 --> 00:51:18,480
Uh...

945
00:51:18,752 --> 00:51:21,059
Because I knew it wasn't easy

946
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:24,262
to get a sexual minority on this show.

947
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:26,926
Everyone has a career, limitations.

948
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,276
In other people's eyes,
I look feminine no matter what

949
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:35,387
because I wear very bright colors.

950
00:51:35,942 --> 00:51:38,582
I want those stereotypes to disappear.

951
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:40,496
Regardless of the appearances,

952
00:51:40,785 --> 00:51:44,020
sexual orientations can differ.

953
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,415
I understand that very well.

954
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,215
And I think your idea is very cool.

955
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,200
So I try to dress like this
even though it can be uncomfortable.

956
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:56,335
- That touches me.
- No, no.

957
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,402
I came to find a girlfriend.

958
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,637
We all came to find a girlfriend.

959
00:52:01,464 --> 00:52:05,124
That's true, but it takes
courage to find a girlfriend.

960
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:07,748
- Actually...
- What?

961
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:08,992
(Love Letters)
We got something.

962
00:52:09,017 --> 00:52:10,030
Love letters.

963
00:52:10,055 --> 00:52:11,202
Eh?

964
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,621
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

965
00:52:18,509 --> 00:52:20,169
Heart chambers.

966
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:29,137
(Love letters are used to express
feelings in the ToGetHer houses.)

967
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:32,066
(Write a letter to the person you like the most)

968
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:34,068
(from the first meeting anonymously.)

969
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:40,340
"Write a letter to the person..."

970
00:52:40,747 --> 00:52:42,918
Oh. I see.

971
00:52:43,424 --> 00:52:44,848
Just one person?

972
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,791
Letters are more ambiguous than telephone.

973
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:56,324
I think it's fun.

974
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:01,391
"Write a letter to the person you like the most"

975
00:53:02,488 --> 00:53:05,520
"from the first meeting anonymously."

976
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,668
Anonymously.

977
00:53:08,036 --> 00:53:09,855
Pink is too obvious.

978
00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:11,754
Let's go with dark pink.

979
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,150
I haven't confessed my feelings
to anyone in a long time

980
00:53:23,175 --> 00:53:24,675
I'm very excited.

981
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,523
That I wrote...

982
00:53:27,548 --> 00:53:31,695
It feels like I conveyed
both my desires and envy.

983
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,789
I think in itself, writing letters

984
00:53:33,814 --> 00:53:37,658
are for talking to someone we're close to.

985
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,429
But we're asked to write a letter

986
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:42,468
to confess our feelings to someone

987
00:53:42,493 --> 00:53:43,922
we don't know that well.

988
00:53:43,947 --> 00:53:46,861
It's a feeling I've never felt before.

989
00:53:47,675 --> 00:53:51,055
I didn't write to the first person
I felt something with.

990
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:53,233
I wrote to the person I think

991
00:53:53,258 --> 00:53:56,243
should approach me first with enthusiasm.

992
00:53:57,283 --> 00:53:59,226
When I write a letter to someone,

993
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:01,454
I think very hard

994
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:04,034
before writing.

995
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:06,931
But in this case, we just met,

996
00:54:06,956 --> 00:54:11,153
so I wrote a short message
to confess my feelings.

997
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:13,978
It didn't come from my heart completely.

998
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:27,298
(Who will receive these first impressions?)

999
00:54:27,323 --> 00:54:31,126
(ToGetHer House 1)

1000
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:35,820
(Love letters have arrived.
Please check your mailbox.)

1001
00:54:35,845 --> 00:54:37,317
Eh?

1002
00:54:37,342 --> 00:54:38,542
When?

1003
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:42,139
(Love letters have arrived.
Please check your mailbox.)

1004
00:54:42,164 --> 00:54:43,626
Eh?

1005
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:46,171
Oh!

1006
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:50,321
What if I didn't get any?

1007
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,740
It's possible.

1008
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:55,087
But do we have to open it
in front of other people?

1009
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,759
I didn't get any.

1010
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:02,532
I don't think I got one.

1011
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,720
Maybe it's just a drill.

1012
00:55:15,622 --> 00:55:20,478
(Mirang goes back sit down immediately.)

1013
00:55:20,697 --> 00:55:21,759
(Glancing)

1014
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:31,156
What the heck? This is driving me crazy.

1015
00:55:31,181 --> 00:55:32,525
(Mirang rechecks the box.)

1016
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:41,072
(No letters to Mirang.)

1017
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,678
(Kim Seoyeon)

1018
00:56:01,188 --> 00:56:04,146
(One love letter to Seoyeon)

1019
00:56:08,888 --> 00:56:11,599
Actually, I didn't expect to get any

1020
00:56:11,624 --> 00:56:12,857
because

1021
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,475
from the first meeting until now,

1022
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,160
no one has sent me any signal.

1023
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:27,325
(To Seoyeon, you have a very beautiful smile.)

1024
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:53,275
Potential suspects are

1025
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,635
Ms. Riwon or Ms. Jinah.

1026
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,807
I deducted from the drawing of a heart.

1027
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,566
That's why they're my guesses.

1028
00:57:03,351 --> 00:57:04,832
(Riwon)

1029
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:11,910
(Surprised)

1030
00:57:17,253 --> 00:57:21,292
(One love letter to Riwon)

1031
00:57:31,624 --> 00:57:35,343
"To Riwon, thank you for asking me
today what perfume I used."

1032
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,796
"I'm glad I chose that one."

1033
00:57:39,752 --> 00:57:41,472
What perfume do you use?

1034
00:57:41,616 --> 00:57:42,867
Perfume?

1035
00:57:43,569 --> 00:57:45,254
What perfume?

1036
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:46,586
You like it?

1037
00:57:46,611 --> 00:57:48,351
Yes, when I was shocked when you walked in.

1038
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:52,345
"As soon as I opened the door,
you were there to welcome me."

1039
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,450
"I didn't change the room out of malice.
Please don't misunderstand."

1040
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:58,130
Ms. Dagyo.

1041
00:57:58,155 --> 00:57:59,241
But I...

1042
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:03,905
didn't want to be chosen by many people.

1043
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:07,569
I wanted to get one from the person
I sent my letter to. Just one is enough.

1044
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:10,108
I'm gonna check my box.

1045
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:14,132
(Park Dagyo)

1046
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,157
(One love letter to Dagyo)

1047
00:58:15,182 --> 00:58:18,758
I was shocked because
I thought I wouldn't get any.

1048
00:58:18,783 --> 00:58:21,108
I think I was quiet.

1049
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,429
"To Ms. Dagyo,"

1050
00:58:28,728 --> 00:58:33,075
"you look quiet and different from others,
so I want to get to know you better."

1051
00:58:33,162 --> 00:58:34,522
"You're very beautiful."

1052
00:58:37,034 --> 00:58:38,857
I knew immediately who it was.

1053
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,208
As soon as I read it, my senses told me.

1054
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:43,987
I could just picture Hangyeol.

1055
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:45,972
I felt that way immediately.

1056
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:50,154
(Jeong Hangyeol)

1057
00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:01,915
(No letters)

1058
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,904
When I opened my mailbox,

1059
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:05,709
there was nothing,

1060
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:10,100
so I acted indifferent

1061
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:12,265
and let it go because

1062
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:16,012
someone must play the role of unchosen ones.

1063
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:17,585
I expect things to be like this

1064
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,685
and me to feel like this

1065
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:21,416
until I leave.

1066
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:23,161
That's what I think.

1067
00:59:24,024 --> 00:59:25,625
(Kim Jinah)
Where should I go?

1068
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:27,641
So I'll just check it here.

1069
00:59:38,346 --> 00:59:40,665
When I saw the handwriting,

1070
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,310
it was an adult handwriting.

1071
00:59:42,335 --> 00:59:43,975
That I wanted was

1072
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,535
a mature-looking handwriting.
Either Hangyeol or Heeyoung.

1073
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,815
So...

1074
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,102
I thought about

1075
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,347
the two of them.

1076
01:00:05,275 --> 01:00:08,680
(Three love letters to Heeyoung)

1077
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:10,521
I was extremely shocked.

1078
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:12,593
I don't get it at all.

1079
01:00:12,618 --> 01:00:14,524
Nothing has happened.

1080
01:00:14,602 --> 01:00:16,993
"Me?" Something like that.

1081
01:00:18,509 --> 01:00:23,071
(Heeyoung receives the most love letters.)

1082
01:00:23,221 --> 01:00:25,065
I can't tell who they are.

1083
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,843
I have no idea.

1084
01:00:26,868 --> 01:00:29,104
"Your eyes are very beautiful."

1085
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:31,766
"I want to be closer to you."

1086
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,101
"Pleased to meet you."

1087
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,510
I wrote a letter to Ms. Park Heeyoung.

1088
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,290
"To Ms. Heeyoung,"

1089
01:00:40,315 --> 01:00:42,776
"The first time we were all together,"

1090
01:00:42,801 --> 01:00:45,182
"I saw only you almost the entire time."

1091
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:47,547
"About 99.9 percent."

1092
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,799
"Dear Heeyoung,"

1093
01:00:51,165 --> 01:00:53,180
"I'm quite shy"

1094
01:00:53,205 --> 01:00:55,965
"so I don't usually make eye contact."

1095
01:00:56,135 --> 01:00:58,810
"But I fell in love with your bright eyes"

1096
01:00:59,442 --> 01:01:01,202
and they're still in my mind's eye."

1097
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,815
(Park Heeyoung)

1098
01:01:13,344 --> 01:01:14,526
What should I do?

1099
01:01:16,394 --> 01:01:20,779
(The person who got three letters)

1100
01:01:20,804 --> 01:01:26,330
(And the people who didn't get any)

1101
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,679
It's quite thrilling.

1102
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:54,531
But it didn't surprise me.

1103
01:01:55,106 --> 01:01:57,106
I'll can go after them myself.

1104
01:02:03,234 --> 01:02:04,476
We made a mistake.

1105
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:05,734
(A date with Heeyoung
who got the most letters)

1106
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:07,617
- What the heck?
- We made a mistake.

1107
01:02:08,109 --> 01:02:09,448
(You can ask her out right now.)

1108
01:02:09,473 --> 01:02:10,507
Eh?

1109
01:02:10,914 --> 01:02:13,748
- I'm curious.
- I'm really curious.

1110
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:15,615
Why? You're the hottest.

1111
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:17,195
What?

1112
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,629
What do they want me to do?

1113
01:02:18,654 --> 01:02:19,765
What?

1114
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,868
It's fun, but even so.

1115
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:23,303
- What do I do?
- But what does that mean?

1116
01:02:23,328 --> 01:02:24,422
I know.

1117
01:02:25,672 --> 01:02:27,600
- Goodness.
- Now I'm

1118
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,061
like my audience.

1119
01:02:29,086 --> 01:02:31,086
Because you see Heeyoung's reaction
and look at Dagyo,

1120
01:02:31,104 --> 01:02:33,779
it's like watching from a VCR.

1121
01:02:33,804 --> 01:02:36,101
And the audience is Dagyo who's looking at me,

1122
01:02:36,398 --> 01:02:38,913
doing this at me.

1123
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:39,945
What should I do?

1124
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,644
You were doing that while watching me?

1125
01:02:41,669 --> 01:02:42,669
When you said, "What?"

1126
01:02:42,684 --> 01:02:45,746
Ms. Dagyo was doing that.

1127
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,387
So fun.

1128
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,905
Well, do you wanna go on a date?

1129
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,883
Well, do you wanna go on a date?

1130
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:56,453
(Do you wanna go on a date?)

1131
01:02:56,478 --> 01:02:57,883
Well, do you wanna go on a date?

1132
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:01,094
(Do you wanna go on a date?)

1133
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:06,335
I'm adamant about things

1134
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,031
that will make her truly happy.

1135
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:10,945
I want love that doesn't come
with a question mark.

1136
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:14,616
I've been told the smile in my eyes
is beautiful when I smile.

1137
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:16,272
I want love

1138
01:03:16,297 --> 01:03:18,811
that's romantic on Jeju Island.

1139
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,475
I'm someone who
falls in love at first sight.

1140
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,280
I will never confuse her.

1141
01:03:22,305 --> 01:03:24,531
I will always make her happy.

1142
01:03:24,556 --> 01:03:27,117
I won't make her regret dating me.

1143
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,103
I will do my best until the very end

1144
01:03:31,128 --> 01:03:33,031
in order to get her.

1145
01:03:34,259 --> 01:03:35,867
I won't back down.

1146
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,444
The looks in their eyes.

1147
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:40,639
I'm usually attracted by these things.

1148
01:03:40,664 --> 01:03:43,100
I'm someone who will go all out

1149
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:45,053
for someone I'm really sure about.

1150
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:46,467
My charm is

1151
01:03:46,492 --> 01:03:48,936
my eyes that can draw in the other person.

1152
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:52,631
If she smells nice,
I will have a good feeling about her.

1153
01:03:52,656 --> 01:03:55,217
If I like someone, it doesn't matter

1154
01:03:55,242 --> 01:03:57,310
if it takes one or two years,

1155
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:59,415
She'll definitely date me.
