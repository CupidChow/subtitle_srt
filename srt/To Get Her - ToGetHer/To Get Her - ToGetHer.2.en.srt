1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,160
We messed up.
(1:1 date right)

2
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
(With Park Hee Young who got the most letters)
What? - We messed up.

3
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,129
(Choose the person you want to date.
Huh? - Why?

4
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,539
- I want to know now.
- I really want to know.

5
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,493
You're super popular.

6
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:51,974
What?

7
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:54,053
What should I do?

8
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:57,245
- It's fun. Even if it's fun
- What should I do?

9
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:59,106
- but what does it mean to do something?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,780
- Oh no.
- Now I feel like a viewer.

11
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,294
Because when I saw Heeyoung's behavior,
and when I look at Dagyo

12
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:08,724
it’s like watching a VCR.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,206
And the person in the studio is

14
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:11,500
Dagyo who is looking at me.

15
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,936
Doing this for me.

16
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:14,784
What should I do?

17
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:15,918
So you're doing this while

18
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:16,855
you're watching me?

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,725
Whenever Heeyoung says something,

20
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:20,478
Dagyo does this.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,384
That's so much fun.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,240
So shall we go on a date?

23
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,907
- So fun.
- So shall we go on a date?

24
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:33,293
Huh?

25
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:35,711
- So fun.
- So shall we go on a date?

26
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,201
Huh?

27
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:39,835
Me?

28
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,858
Oh, is that what this is about?

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,731
- I'll step out for a moment.
- No, no.

30
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:53,182
Let the ladies talk.

31
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:54,750
Excuse me.

32
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,739
I'm shocked, happy, excited,

33
00:01:58,767 --> 00:01:59,807
and grateful.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,860
What to do? The situation is like this.

35
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,980
If it's not an order,

36
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:08,377
I would've taken it slowly.

37
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,447
Well...

38
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,973
It's like I was in a hurry

39
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,056
and it turned out like that.

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,659
But even so, I can't date

41
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:18,900
someone I'm not interested in.

42
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,965
- Oh no.
- What viewer?

43
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:25,019
I’m not a viewer.

44
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,025
I was watching.

45
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,332
- Shall we go now?
- Let's go.

46
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,439
Being a loser...

47
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,673
But it's too early to feel sad about it.

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,241
It's only the first day.

49
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,966
Is the first day normally

50
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:55,093
this uncomfortable?

51
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,894
It's really uncomfortable.

52
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,350
It's so uncomfortable.

53
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:06,187
It feels a little weird.

54
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,486
Wow, this is...

55
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,945
(1:1 date partners are chosen.
The chosen one, prepare for a date)

56
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,595
- Wow.
- Oh.

57
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,856
- I'm jealous.
- We just sleep in the room.

58
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:34,343
Then who? Who do they mean?

59
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:35,657
First of all,

60
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:39,008
- It's not us.
- That is...

61
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,157
Let's leave.

62
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:46,936
Let's leave.

63
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,466
What should I do?

64
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:56,792
- Tell me later after you go out.
- Sure.

65
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,074
(An exciting first date.
What will they talk about?)

66
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,603
(Hyubjaeri Restaurant)
Oh, there are three of them.

67
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,400
- What? There are three of them?
- Yes.

68
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:14,088
Do you like dogs or cats more?

69
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:16,893
I like all animals.

70
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,674
Awesome.

71
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,717
- Awesome?
- Great.

72
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,707
That's not what I meant.

73
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,263
- I mean you're great.
- Let's go in.

74
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,225
Anyone here?

75
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:38,316
(Private dinner prepared)
They've already placed it.

76
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,719
First meal on Jeju Island.

77
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,908
Wow, seriously.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm so hungry.

79
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,695
(Jinah, Heeyoung's date)
Bon appétit.

80
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:47,857
(With a Jeju Island feel)

81
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,932
Mackerel and swordfish for sure.

82
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,100
I really want to take a picture.

83
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:52,568
I'll take a picture too.

84
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,856
(Keeping first date memories)

85
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:57,840
Open location tags.

86
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,569
(Unable to do it)

87
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,820
But the photos aren't pretty.

88
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,336
Just keep it.

89
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:14,766
But this looks like it was caught by me.

90
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,338
Just like that.

91
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:19,266
That's okay.

92
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,272
(Regret)

93
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,134
Should I use this?

94
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:26,662
Bon appétit.

95
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,736
(Heeyoung brought a film camera)

96
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:34,506
Want me to take a picture?

97
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,299
Here? Let's I take a picture later?

98
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:45,962
Whenever I go on a date,

99
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:49,214
I like to keep the memories together.

100
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:50,877
I also think I want to

101
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,644
try taking pictures when I go on a date.

102
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:57,980
It's time to start eating.

103
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:01,363
(Quickly check the menu)

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,769
Mackerel, swordfish,

105
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,383
and stir-fried pork?

106
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,770
I don't know what to eat first.

107
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,701
- The gosari is delicious.
- Is it delicious?

108
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,588
(Smiles)

109
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:32,621
The mackerel is delicious.

110
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:41,016
Do you cook?

111
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,913
Since I have to work, I often eat out.

112
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:46,310
- That's true.
- But...

113
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,686
- I often do.
- Really?

114
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,580
I like to cook for myself.

115
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,370
What do you usually cook?

116
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:58,586
To be frank,

117
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,292
I make snacks for wine at home.

118
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,106
Or Korean food, mostly.

119
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,081
(I see)

120
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,949
Like ginseng chicken, eel soup,

121
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,556
something like that.

122
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,321
Nourishing food.

123
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:15,017
(Surprised)

124
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,246
I don't often eat

125
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,153
in bright places after sunset.

126
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,510
I usually go to wine bars,

127
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:22,803
so I feel weird about

128
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,023
the brightness right now.

129
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,570
I like dark places too.

130
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,485
I don't really turn on

131
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:30,552
the lights at home.

132
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,207
I only turn on small lamps.

133
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,352
I don't turn on the lights much except

134
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,005
for cleaning and putting on makeup.

135
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,782
Yes, but I put on makeup in the dark.

136
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:41,900
But like that,

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,254
the powder will stick all over.

138
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,399
(Embarrassed)
That's right.

139
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,120
Do you usually like to travel?

140
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,048
I like to travel.

141
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,273
Huh?

142
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,503
I like to travel.

143
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:03,885
Tokyo. Okinawa.

144
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,495
Canada. Hong Kong. Places where I went

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,777
in the last year.

146
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,332
- I also went to Canada and Okinawa.
- Really?

147
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:14,303
- I should go to Okinawa in March.
- I went in June.

148
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,084
Canada in September.

149
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,020
(Could it be?)

150
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,067
Canada in August.

151
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:25,360
It was my first time in Canada, Toronto.

152
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:26,576
Me too.

153
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,910
Really?

154
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,391
It was my birthday,

155
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,216
so I went to Niagara Falls.

156
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,350
Me too.

157
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:40,589
- It was really good.
- It was good.

158
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,291
It was really beautiful.

159
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,537
(They gradually find
something in common)

160
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,640
Do you wake up late?

161
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:47,996
Do you stay up late?

162
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,438
Do you sleep when the sun rise?

163
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:52,246
It depends.

164
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,840
What do you think of people

165
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,593
who live an upright life?

166
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:57,618
Not fun?

167
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,249
Someone who lives an upright life?

168
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:04,557
I actually call myself a boring person.

169
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,376
- Mm.
- I sleep early.

170
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:09,931
(Worried)

171
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:11,911
People who aren't fun

172
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:13,085
still won't be fun even if

173
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,385
they stay up until dawn.

174
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,405
(Smiles)

175
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,252
I don't go out much.

176
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:22,352
I just stay at home.

177
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,279
But it's not like

178
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:25,760
I only like dating at home,

179
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:28,811
I like being at home together.

180
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,423
It's not that it has to be all the time.

181
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:41,459
So what do you normally do

182
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:42,706
when you date at home?

183
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,026
(Curious)

184
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,952
I just like being together.

185
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,578
If we're at home together,

186
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,198
I probably like it.

187
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,124
If I'm dating someone,

188
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,724
I wouldn't have many friends.

189
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,233
My partner is my friend.

190
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,670
We're partner in every way.

191
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,183
So I think I like to date at home too.

192
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,840
But I think that if I date a guy,

193
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:17,950
we won't be compatible in every way.

194
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,172
What I think is, besides gender,

195
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:27,589
I look at the person.

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,418
- Yes.
- We already have friends.

197
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,846
Whether it's a man or a woman,

198
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:33,366
they have that kind of thing.

199
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,593
But with men, as you said, it's hard

200
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,696
to take the next step.

201
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:44,540
So the people I like are usually

202
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,351
the perfect person

203
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:48,056
that I want to be.

204
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,529
People who have a fairly strong mind

205
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,185
or kind-hearted...

206
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:58,481
But...
(I, I, I!)

207
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:00,620
But...

208
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:02,859
My mind is quite strong.

209
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:06,913
My mind is strong.

210
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,307
I tend to like people like that

211
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:12,213
because of the future.

212
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,439
So I can live with them.

213
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:15,726
That's what I think.

214
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,106
(Heeyoung who dreams of spending the future
with the person she wants to be)

215
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:23,333
She's a person who tells stories

216
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:25,438
about herself very well.

217
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,564
And other various topics.

218
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:29,995
I feel like she's a person

219
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,380
who thinks a lot.

220
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:35,513
Her most charming point is talking.

221
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:39,071
We didn't feel uncomfortable

222
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,518
talking about them.

223
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,131
I can reply to her easily.

224
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:45,873
I really like this kind of conversation.

225
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:52,554
(Two people who got to know each other
better through their first date)

226
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,424
I don't know who sent it.

227
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,856
- I don't know.
- You don't know, do you?

228
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,670
Do you want to know?

229
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:04,566
(Nods)

230
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,381
I want to know.

231
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:09,218
I don't know any of them.

232
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,786
Really.

233
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,920
I wrote a very long one.

234
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,539
Why do you want to write to that person?

235
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:19,695
That's why I wrote a very long one.

236
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:21,132
But the other party,

237
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,749
when there was only one word,

238
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,111
I felt a little sad.

239
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,634
I wrote a lot.

240
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,496
(Embarrassed)

241
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,746
Then who did you write to?

242
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,630
Isn't there anything?

243
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:40,656
The flower picture.

244
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,266
(The flower picture?)

245
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,395
Oh!

246
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,842
(The letter earlier)

247
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,266
(To Heeyoung, I'm shy so
I don't dare to look in the eye)

248
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,427
(but I intentionally gave you
a strong look once)

249
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,226
(Jinah sends a first impression
letter to Heeyoung)

250
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:12,746
I chose you Jinah

251
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,451
as my first impression.

252
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,786
The reason is that I was attracted.

253
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,857
(The two of them liked each other from the beginning)
So she wrote to me.

254
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,461
It's a new feeling of my heart

255
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,366
that I've never felt before,

256
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,819
so I wrote it for her.

257
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,864
So small and cute.

258
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:37,599
But she's someone who makes

259
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:40,024
my heart beat and I want to rely on.

260
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,463
(Jinah's inner feelings revealed shyly)

261
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,192
Did I write too long?

262
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:49,806
Because I felt very sad.

263
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,409
I saw it and felt like

264
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,456
we could write like this?

265
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,623
Then who did you think it was?

266
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:03,739
I don't know either.

267
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,861
I didn't think you'd write to me.

268
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,313
I don't have a sense, I guess.

269
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,366
I guess I'm stupid.

270
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,536
Of course I feel good.

271
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:23,739
It's me, after all, like that.

272
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,603
Of all the letters,

273
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,430
this is the most memorable.

274
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:35,502
(Hesitates)

275
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,052
If we went out to eat,

276
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,859
I had something to ask you.

277
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:42,358
But it's so bright that

278
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:43,358
I don't dare ask.

279
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:51,156
- It's so bright that I don't dare ask.
- What is it?

280
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:55,490
(Hesitates)
It's...

281
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,876
Well... But...

282
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,787
- Do you know what I'm going to ask?
- I don't know.

283
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,018
- Why did you ask me out on a date?
- What?

284
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:21,500
- Why did you ask me out on a date?
- What?

285
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,432
What?

286
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,416
(Embarrassed)

287
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:29,338
What?

288
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,873
Why did you ask me out on a date?

289
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,927
I'm curious.

290
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:36,928
I heard that.

291
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,261
Why did you ask me on a date?

292
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,468
(The question Jinah wants to ask
the most is why did you choose her?)

293
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:07,480
I want to know about you the most.

294
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:09,547
I'm curious.

295
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:15,716
Your method, the accent,

296
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:17,403
your language, Jinah,

297
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,380
they make me feel curious the most.

298
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,318
And I want to know

299
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:27,345
why you wrote it in pink.

300
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:32,460
Because you said you like pink.

301
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:38,510
I just think too much.

302
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,443
(Will two people who were interested in
each other from the beginning continue?)

303
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:51,923
(While they're on a date,
at the Together House)

304
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:54,920
How's my face?

305
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,011
- So pretty.
- Really?

306
00:16:58,152 --> 00:17:01,595
It looks like my makeup is smudged.

307
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:02,851
It's been hours.

308
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,806
We were far apart just now.

309
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,221
So far away.

310
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:10,205
- So I can't see your face clearly.
- At first?

311
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:14,081
I didn't see that smile clearly.

312
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,778
A peach face.

313
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,487
I've never heard anyone say that before.

314
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:20,792
(Thank you)

315
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:25,420
I'm sure Hangyeol wrote me the letter.

316
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,806
Even when she complimented me,

317
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:28,442
there was a certain look in her eyes.

318
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,659
Oh, it's really Hangyeol.

319
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:31,964
That's how I felt.

320
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,896
- Do you have cotton swabs?
- I'll go get them for you.

321
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,251
- Alright.
- How many do you want?

322
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,292
Just one.

323
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:38,782
Oh yeah.

324
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,075
On the first vote,

325
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,102
I wrote a letter to Heeyoung.

326
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,524
Certain people shine brighter

327
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:50,465
when viewed up close than from afar.

328
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,405
Just like Dagyo.

329
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,449
Her brightness.

330
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:58,720
Or the way she smiles.

331
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,553
Something like this,

332
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:02,393
when you see them up close,

333
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,373
it's more impressive than I thought.

334
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,258
It's like confirming what

335
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:08,945
kind of image she has.

336
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,079
She'll always be on my mind.

337
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,989
It's a strange kind of confidence.

338
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:15,383
Will your face turn red

339
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:16,947
- if you drink alcohol?
- No, I won't.

340
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,587
- You said your face would turn red.
- Yes.

341
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,860
I'm so jealous.

342
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:24,331
I used to do this too.

343
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,474
- If you asked about my type,
- Yes?

344
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,983
I used to say women whose faces

345
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,688
turn red when they drink.

346
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,186
Hey, you.

347
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,370
- No, no.
- No?

348
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,188
Don't misunderstand, huh?

349
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:38,625
There are many people who like

350
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,645
people who turn red when they drink.

351
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,544
Dagyo,

352
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,569
the way she smiles is so cute.

353
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:48,822
Even though it seems like

354
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,841
she says everything,

355
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:52,081
she seems to be careful with her words.

356
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,155
She looks mysterious,

357
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:56,095
so I want to get to know her.

358
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,195
And I like people who wear blue.

359
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:02,390
She was wearing a blue shirt.

360
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:05,487
That's why I kept looking at her.

361
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:09,282
- I...
- Thank you.

362
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,945
I'll be sure to use it well.

363
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,333
Okay.

364
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,671
- Does she have to come?
- Riwon.

365
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,060
She's asleep.

366
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:19,481
Oh, Riwon is sleeping?

367
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,020
I heard she's not feeling well,

368
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,143
she has a fever.

369
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,144
So she's sleeping.

370
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:26,315
(Riwon isn't feeling well
because she has a fever)

371
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:30,099
(Recharging energy during rest)

372
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,473
Do you exercise?

373
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,591
- It's a secret.
- Should we start tomorrow morning?

374
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:36,585
- Sure.
- Great.

375
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,567
Really?

376
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,264
- Do you go to the gym?
- Not really.

377
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:41,461
But they said they had a gym,

378
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:42,812
so I'll go to reduce the swelling

379
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:43,722
in the morning.

380
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:44,861
The thing I hate the most

381
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,160
in the world is exercising.

382
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:48,149
- Really?
- Well, I can go.

383
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,799
- But the journey is...
- Yes, the journey.

384
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,642
So I made a fitness center at home.

385
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:02,630
The rest of us can cook dinner.

386
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,751
Then we'll cook dinner.

387
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,562
- Want to look at the fridge?
- Or should we do it together?

388
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,284
- Let's cook together.
- Let's open the fridge and take a look

389
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,897
and see what we can cook.

390
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:12,986
Let's try opening it

391
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,010
first.

392
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:16,831
Spaghetti.

393
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,833
- Spaghetti.
- Does anyone know how to make it?

394
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,458
We'll stir-fry the sauce

395
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:21,804
and prepare it first.

396
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:23,393
We'll boil the noodles and

397
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:24,526
then add them later.

398
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:26,890
- Budae jjigae.
- I really want to eat raw fish.

399
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,423
This should be tteokbokki.

400
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,551
- Tteokbokki and...
- Yellowtail fish.

401
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:31,920
Yellowtail and mackerel.

402
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,190
Then what should we do?

403
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,410
There are four of us.

404
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,884
Tteokbokki seems delicious.

405
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,013
Then make both raw fish.

406
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,636
- And some soup.
- Yes, some soup.

407
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:43,604
And if the others come back,

408
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,061
in case someone else wants

409
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:46,208
to eat it then.

410
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:48,823
Then tteokbokki. - They've having a good meal.
- They're on a date.

411
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,190
Come back.

412
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,379
(Refuses)

413
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:53,408
Please divide the tasks.

414
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:55,550
- Is that so?
- Then what are we going to do?

415
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:57,585
- Budae jjigae.
- What else?

416
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:58,743
Nothing much.

417
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,235
- Sit down, I'll make it.
- Soup with raw fish?

418
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:03,978
- How can that be?
- Then...

419
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,528
- Then...
- I...

420
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:08,990
I'll help people not to stick together.

421
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:10,645
We probably didn't drink much alcohol.
I'll help clean up later.

422
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,801
- We'll clean up later.
- Is that okay?

423
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,362
- That's great.
- Good.

424
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,764
I'll help.

425
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:17,389
(Mirang is the first person to cook dinner)

426
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,242
There's no reason.

427
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:23,711
I like cooking anyway.

428
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:26,554
I just think I have to do it.

429
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,623
Should I wash it?

430
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:33,387
I'm already dirty anyway.

431
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:36,851
Can you help me unwrap it? Budae jjigae

432
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:43,892
Mirang is the one taking the lead

433
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:45,820
and doing everything first,

434
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,239
but actually, I also want

435
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:48,719
to do things like that.

436
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:50,529
However, it feels like

437
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:52,381
I’d just be getting in the way

438
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,722
when I see someone so skilled

439
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,281
it makes me feel insecure,

440
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:57,581
like I might be overshadowed

441
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:58,610
by their charm.

442
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:00,034
But on the other hand,

443
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,590
I’m jealous and want to be like them.

444
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:04,463
I wish I was born that way.

445
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,037
It makes me feel that way too.

446
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:09,171
- Can you eat spicy food?
- Yes.

447
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:11,942
Can you eat spicy food, Dagyo?

448
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:13,664
You mentioned earlier that you can't.

449
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,196
- Not at all.
- Not at all?

450
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:18,443
- If so...
- Just ours has chili peppers.

451
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,410
You two can eat spicy food, huh?

452
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:22,403
- Can't eat spicy food?
- I can't eat it at all.

453
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:25,050
- We're the same. No alcohol for me too.
- Yes.

454
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,618
(Seoyeon and Dagyo who eat similar food)

455
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:28,910
How tall are you?

456
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:30,879
I'm 174 cm.

457
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,090
I thought so.

458
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,855
Why is everyone so tall?

459
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,623
I was just standing there,

460
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:37,808
and I was only this tall.

461
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,273
I had to look up at everyone.

462
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:41,816
- Do you like tall or short women?
- I like tall people.

463
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:43,818
Because I'm short.

464
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,851
I like people who are taller.

465
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:46,907
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:51,309
I got to talk a lot with Dagyo

467
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:54,075
while waiting for dinner.

468
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:56,251
We actually have so much in common.

469
00:22:56,284 --> 00:22:58,799
She also smiles so easily.

470
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,632
Just because of little things like that,

471
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,045
I ended up feeling much better.

472
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,572
What should I do? Should I just move?

473
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,950
(Riwon who has already come down)
Huh?

474
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,489
Are you okay, Riwon?

475
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:09,891
- I want to help.
- Yes.

476
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:11,145
I want to help.

477
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:14,836
- Please sit down, you're sick.
- I'm not that sick.

478
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:17,552
Really? But please sit down and rest.

479
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,500
Please let me help with something.

480
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,820
- I'll sit down soon.
- I didn't do anything.

481
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,538
Want to clean up after
we're done eating?

482
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:26,661
- That's great.
- I didn't do anything either.

483
00:23:26,683 --> 00:23:28,042
- I have to do it.
- Now...

484
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:29,384
Seoyeon and I will take

485
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:31,078
- care of cleaning up.
- Yes.

486
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,247
- Really?
- No.

487
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:33,761
Please don't steal my work.

488
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:37,396
"At first,

489
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:39,144
I was deciding between

490
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,849
Hangyeol and Seoyeon.

491
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:43,791
But Seoyeon has such a beautiful smile,

492
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:45,672
so I ended up choosing her.

493
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,176
(Sneaking a peek)

494
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:50,388
It must be really hot.

495
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:52,986
- Is there anything else?
- Right now...

496
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,097
It's really hot. Aren't you hot?

497
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:57,293
So cool.

498
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,247
- It's hot, it's hot.
- It's not hot.

499
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:04,574
(The first dinner at Together House,
prepared with care by Mirang)

500
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:10,780
(and fresh raw fish
that you must try from Jeju Island)

501
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,327
Looks delicious.

502
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:14,531
Thank you.

503
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,440
It's definitely delicious.

504
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:18,652
Try it.

505
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,073
- Try it?
- Yes.

506
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,930
(Starting with Soyeon)

507
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:25,686
- It's really delicious.
- Is it okay?

508
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,216
It tastes like oden soup.

509
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:29,259
A soup that goes down

510
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,143
your throat easily.

511
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,373
It must be refreshing.

512
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:33,274
It's really delicious.

513
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:34,401
- Is it delicious?
- Yes.

514
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:37,218
It tastes like oden soup.

515
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,786
Yes, take the meat out too.

516
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:42,926
The mackerel is so delicious.

517
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,354
Mackerel or yellowtail fish?

518
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,627
- Mackerel.
- Mackerel, I see.

519
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:49,577
- I like mackerel better.
- Me too.

520
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,206
I don't like it, but it's delicious.

521
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:52,981
- It's delicious.
- You don't like mackerel?

522
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:54,039
(Nods)

523
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,033
How can you not like mackerel?

524
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:57,610
I don't like white meat.

525
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,403
I like raw fish that's a bit fatty.

526
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,199
Is it too big? Yellowtail fish.

527
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:03,691
- If it's big, I'll cut it for you.
- It's okay.

528
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,680
People who like to eat yellowtail fish

529
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:08,700
like to eat the thick slices.

530
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,763
Have you ever been with someone

531
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:12,746
who doesn't eat the same things as you?

532
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:13,761
Eat spicy food.

533
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:16,257
Will you also eat spicy food?

534
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,067
- The other party eats spicy food.
- It's clearly self-harm.

535
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,279
This is torture. Normally,

536
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:24,061
if someone doesn’t eat, you respect that

537
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:25,219
- you don’t force them to eat it.
- That's right.

538
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,808
- It's torture.
- Yes, it's torture. - That's right.

539
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:28,882
(Pepper)
We're just completely different

540
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,792
when it comes to food.

541
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:33,106
She said she can't handle

542
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,959
even a little spice,

543
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,730
and as for sushi.

544
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:38,925
I don't like the fatty cuts at all,

545
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,451
but that's exactly what she loves.

546
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:44,626
We don't have a single thing in common.

547
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:46,748
(Looks)

548
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,577
Chopsticks come in pairs.

549
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,733
- I thought they were the same.
- Really?

550
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:53,898
- It's different.
- Mine is different.

551
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,768
Mine too.

552
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,330
It seems like something bad

553
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,758
is going to happen.

554
00:25:57,782 --> 00:25:58,651
I'm not like this at all.

555
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:00,875
- I usually care about this.
- Mine is a match.

556
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,190
(Feels bad)

557
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:05,139
Maybe that's why I'm not on a date.

558
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,081
- Right.
- Look at that.

559
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,404
I wonder what they're eating.

560
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:10,079
Will they eat something delicious?

561
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,907
They'll probably eat something delicious
and go somewhere nice.

562
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:12,999
Look at what they wrote

563
00:26:13,027 --> 00:26:14,066
before they left.

564
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,786
(Previous break)

565
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:18,352
It's a gamble. Write it down first.

566
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,817
(Two people write their names
according to the duties for dinner)

567
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,184
That's a cute way to write.

568
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,500
But what was that?

569
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:27,745
- I'm curious.
- Yeah.

570
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:29,891
Everyone had that situation just now.

571
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:33,468
- Geez.
- But we don't know yet.

572
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:36,864
- Yes. - That's right.
- Tomorrow, they might be separated.

573
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,801
- Like...
- Isn't it?

574
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:41,936
- It's possible.
- That might be more fun.

575
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,919
But I think...

576
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:48,629
- The more the merrier.
- It's like you're angry.

577
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:51,580
But the more people there are...

578
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,402
The more airtime

579
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:55,227
we have to steal from them.

580
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,139
(Cute)

581
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,407
I really want to know everyone's age.

582
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,260
- Me too.
- I really want to know.

583
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:02,470
It's what I wonder the most.

584
00:27:02,603 --> 00:27:06,481
But everyone doesn't look that young.

585
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:08,616
That's how I feel.
(Keep my mouth shut)

586
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,055
- Just a guess.
- What if I was young?

587
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:15,770
You must be young then.

588
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:17,945
(Embarrassed)

589
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,252
Don't you like younger people?

590
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,149
If you can obviously tell they're young,

591
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,006
I don't think anyone will like them.

592
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,741
- Age doesn't matter.
- But people like us

593
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:28,953
probably like someone who's mature.

594
00:27:29,144 --> 00:27:30,424
Someone who looks calm.

595
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:32,666
Someone who's sweet and mature.

596
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:33,779
Everyone always says this.

597
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:34,765
The older sister type.

598
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:36,759
I'm the opposite.

599
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,919
I also like someone who's calm.

600
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,500
Do you like cheerful people?

601
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,103
The kind where I just sit around and

602
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:43,996
they come and approach me.

603
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,401
How old are you guys? I wonder.

604
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:47,601
Want to take a guess?

605
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,190
- Take a guess.
- Starting with Hangyeol.

606
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:50,298
Hangyeol...

607
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,880
24 years old.

608
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,779
- 24 years old?
- I think 23 years old.

609
00:27:54,981 --> 00:27:57,877
- Mm.
- I think she's 24 years old.

610
00:27:58,472 --> 00:27:59,480
25 years old.

611
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:03,444
I don't like revealing answers later.

612
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:05,886
Age...

613
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:07,699
It'd be better to reveal

614
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:08,806
everyone's age first.

615
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,127
Dagyo.

616
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:13,059
Me?

617
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,996
- 26 years old.
- I think so too.

618
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,426
I also think you're 26 years old.

619
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,753
- I also think she's 26 years old.
- Me too.

620
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:25,633
(Embarrassed)
Why are you looking at me?

621
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:28,688
I think around 23 years old
would be nice.

622
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:31,706
23 years old?

623
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:33,901
Hangyeol must be 24 years old.

624
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,270
What's so important about this?

625
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:38,506
Do you like younger or older people?

626
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,894
(Interested)

627
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:41,095
- Me?
- Yes.

628
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:43,484
Wait a minute, if you say it like that,

629
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:46,447
I don't want to lead like that.

630
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:50,662
Still naive. Even Now still naive.

631
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,397
- Naive.
- But honestly,

632
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:53,550
age isn't someone's

633
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:54,522
defining characteristic.

634
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:55,674
What matters more is

635
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,306
- the situation.
- That's right.

636
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:59,480
Who they're currently dating,

637
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,222
whether that person is

638
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:04,372
older, younger, or the same age.

639
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:06,566
Beyond that, I don't think

640
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:08,791
people's opinions really matter.

641
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,679
The real problem is if they can't

642
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:12,708
take care of themselves

643
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,309
that's when it becomes an issue.

644
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,855
They'll end up constantly looking

645
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:16,966
for people to depend on.

646
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:18,899
- That's not acceptable.
- But I like it that way.

647
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,968
I want them to rely on me.

648
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,044
- Really? - Yes.
- What?

649
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:25,659
- Do you like helping others?
- Yes.

650
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:28,525
(Shocked)

651
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:31,305
I don't think that's it.

652
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,648
And this matter doesn't really fit me.

653
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,631
Hangyeol's answer...

654
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,739
Even if you seems to genuinely like me,

655
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:40,794
but when it comes to actually dating,

656
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,191
I'm not sure our conversations

657
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:44,206
could sustain that kind of relationship.

658
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,383
This whole experience has

659
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,990
made me think about these things.

660
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,133
- Seoyeon.
- It's now. - Yes.

661
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,284
I think she's 28 years old,

662
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:52,509
but looks young.

663
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:53,902
(Smiles)

664
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:56,003
- I think so.
- I think she's 26 years old.

665
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,333
For me, we were talking about something,

666
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:01,943
32 years old.

667
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:03,125
What are you talking about?

668
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,499
- Why did her age increase that much.
- Yeah.

669
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:07,034
She said that here,

670
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,170
- she is the second oldest.
- Really?

671
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,429
But why do I feel like

672
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:14,668
she's a kindergarten teacher.

673
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,351
An elementary school teacher or a nanny.

674
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:21,048
- I feel that way from her smile.
- That's right.

675
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,644
- Occupations that require smiling.
- So, how old?

676
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:24,982
Huh?

677
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,996
Speechless.

678
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:30,060
27 years old.

679
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:32,570
I'm not good at guessing age.

680
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:33,694
I'm the only weird one.

681
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:36,483
- Sorry.
- I'm weird.

682
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,821
I'm not good at guessing age.

683
00:30:37,846 --> 00:30:38,921
And I think her age

684
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:40,361
shouldn't be that old.

685
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:42,743
I don't think it matters.

686
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,505
Because ultimately, this place is

687
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:46,285
about getting to know someone

688
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,632
for who they truly are.

689
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:50,221
(Laughs)

690
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:52,630
Hangyeol must be having a hard time

691
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:54,388
because she's getting old.

692
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,160
When you like someone, it must be

693
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,474
hard because of your age.

694
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:01,295
(Feeling uneasy)

695
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:05,840
That was honestly

696
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:08,603
my most stressful moment.

697
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:12,747
If they saw me as just a kid,

698
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:14,633
then the whole thing

699
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:16,386
would have been pointless.

700
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,046
Alright.
(Time to guess Riwon's age)

701
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,467
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

702
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:22,870
25 years old.

703
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:24,635
27 years old.

704
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:27,063
I also think she's 27 years old.

705
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,436
You can give me money,

706
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:30,932
I guess she's 24 years old.

707
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,176
How much do you want?

708
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:37,551
You just said you like younger people.

709
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:38,790
Very clever.

710
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:40,055
I don't know. From appearance,

711
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,278
it looks like you're in your mid-20s.

712
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:42,402
But your thinking is like

713
00:31:42,427 --> 00:31:43,676
you're in your late 20s.

714
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,773
But she doesn’t look 30 yeas old.

715
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:47,366
- Just like a professor.
- Analyzing.

716
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,471
Talking about someone's thinking

717
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:54,041
and you're wearing a glasses now.

718
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,800
I actually think my age could be

719
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:58,621
my secret weapon.

720
00:31:58,646 --> 00:32:00,434
Today, everyone seems to think Hangyeol

721
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,928
and I are around the same age.

722
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:05,032
This is going to make things

723
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,790
even more fun from now on.

724
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,956
Do we really have to guess?

725
00:32:10,216 --> 00:32:12,346
I think I can guess everyone's age.

726
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,301
- Try it.
- Maybe she's younger than expected.

727
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:16,470
- No.
- I think early 30s.

728
00:32:16,524 --> 00:32:17,910
- Huh?
- 30 years old but looks young.

729
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,433
- 30 years old but looks young.
- Yes.

730
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,750
- I don't think so.
- But she looks very young.

731
00:32:22,803 --> 00:32:24,728
She looks young but...

732
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:28,482
I can feel her age from her speech.

733
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,238
- Or are you a kid?
- I think she's a sweet person.

734
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,238
She's always caring, observant,

735
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:34,932
and does thoughtful things

736
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:37,425
- that most 20-year-olds wouldn't do.
- Really?

737
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:39,920
I think...

738
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:43,818
I want to be exactly like this.

739
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,674
I'm so impressed. Can I cry?

740
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:49,510
- Seriously, I'm jealous.
- She's probably like that.

741
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,849
Of course, when it comes to vibes,

742
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:53,481
height and all that,

743
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,236
I just can’t copy.

744
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:56,802
Why, Hangyeol has a melancholy aura

745
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:57,724
and that's good.

746
00:32:57,748 --> 00:32:58,812
It's cute.

747
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,241
- What’s so good about that?
- Well...

748
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,575
Looks like someone who reads a lot.

749
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:03,723
Like a smart kid.

750
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,276
Like the genius kid in the neighborhood.

751
00:33:05,303 --> 00:33:06,303
Know what I mean, right?

752
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:07,633
A kid, but kind of mature

753
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:08,986
and talks to adults.

754
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,185
That kind of vibe.

755
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:13,707
- Someone who talks about health.
- Sorry.

756
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,570
Even though you seem like
an espresso type.

757
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:18,052
Not really the dating type.

758
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:20,596
People do have that

759
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:22,249
- kind of person as their type.
- Yes.

760
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,477
I don’t know. I’m not going to listen.

761
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,502
I'll...

762
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:27,768
go straight for it.

763
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:30,991
(Peeking)

764
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:37,865
Try guessing.

765
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,330
Me?

766
00:33:39,903 --> 00:33:41,408
- It's really hard.
- 29 years old.

767
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,951
29 years old? Really?
(Thinking hard)

768
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:48,023
I thought she was young,

769
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:49,704
but hearing everyone else talk,

770
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:50,836
guess she's not that young.

771
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,068
Suddenly changed.
(Sad)

772
00:33:56,324 --> 00:33:57,283
28 years old.

773
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:00,507
- Seem younger than that?
- Yes.

774
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:03,924
She's in a good mood.

775
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:06,808
I'm right, she's glad, see?

776
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,516
- Monet, please.
- You're in a good mood.

777
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:10,844
Behaving so obvious.

778
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,242
Everyone is so innocent.

779
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:17,830
I think the one who looks

780
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,855
the most innocent is Hangyeol.

781
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,816
And the kindest one is Mirang.

782
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,247
How funny. It's fun.

783
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,103
- If we ever found out, it’d be fun!
- It'll be fun to know everyone's age.

784
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:30,018
It seems fun.

785
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:32,012
I'd like to know what kind
of work you do.

786
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,790
I want to know everyone’s occupation.

787
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,450
I really want to know
everyone’s occupation.

788
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,630
Let's try to guess from

789
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:37,814
everyone’s image again.

790
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:39,513
That sounds fun.

791
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,189
- Guess from the image you see.
- Alright.

792
00:34:43,203 --> 00:34:46,252
- Guess in one minute.
- Guess mine.

793
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:47,361
I think...

794
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,699
It's probably a food-related career.

795
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,325
- That's right.
- Like a restaurant.

796
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:52,905
Around a residential area

797
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,198
with a good vibe.

798
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,357
Running a warm and cozy restaurant in

799
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,241
the with a good vibe in
the neighborhood.

800
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,307
It becomes super popular through

801
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,648
word of mouth because she's so kind.

802
00:35:02,681 --> 00:35:06,726
Been doing it for like 15 years.

803
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,430
That kind of image.

804
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:10,376
She's really building out

805
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:11,629
a character here.

806
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:14,690
It's fun. I get really into it.

807
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,212
- Sports.
- A personal trainer?

808
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:23,317
She could be a PT or maybe an athlete.

809
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:25,701
I also thought it might be

810
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:26,724
food industry-related.

811
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:28,054
Do we have the correct answer?

812
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,211
- No.
- No?

813
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:31,352
There isn’t one?

814
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,662
That's surprising.

815
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:34,815
- It's fun.
- What's her occupation?

816
00:35:35,923 --> 00:35:37,578
This is so fun.
(Mirang's mysterious occupation)

817
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,828
Try guessing mine.

818
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,516
- She might be in beauty industry.
- I think...

819
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:44,026
A cheerleader.

820
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:45,779
- A cheerleader?
- Someone said earlier.

821
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,214
It totally suits you.

822
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,787
I kind of look like a hairdresser,

823
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:50,092
or a manicurist.

824
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:52,433
- Seems so.
- A beauty specialist.

825
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,442
A surgeon.

826
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,409
I'm confident about that.

827
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,322
I'm confident about that.

828
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:01,188
- That's right, a nurse.
- Want to try?

829
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:04,625
- You suit being a nurse.
- A dental nurse.

830
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:05,793
A dental Hygienist.

831
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,443
Oh, that’s sexy.

832
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:10,391
- No, right?
- No again?

833
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:11,615
(This time it's Dagyo's occupation)

834
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:13,269
Beautician.

835
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,330
- Pilates.
- I also think pilates.

836
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:19,560
I think she's a cheerleader.

837
00:36:20,363 --> 00:36:24,471
- In the beauty industry.
- How many cheerleaders are there here?

838
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,396
But my height...

839
00:36:26,522 --> 00:36:28,660
But I think you have

840
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,285
that kind of energy.

841
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:34,015
- None.
- Really?

842
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,116
I really want to know

843
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,957
everyone's occupation.

844
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:37,324
Probably a musician.

845
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,703
I think she's a teacher.

846
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,712
She has a smile that seems to

847
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:43,337
work with children.

848
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,007
Probably something to do with beauty.

849
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:47,434
- Beauty?
- Beauty.

850
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,477
Or maybe a model.

851
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,002
Not at all.

852
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:55,450
- Really?
- Geez, I really want to know.

853
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,346
When everyone says there's none,

854
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,465
I want to know even more.

855
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,500
I often hear people say this.

856
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:02,843
I'm not surprised.

857
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:06,410
The person I'm most curious about is...

858
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,424
I want to know what

859
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:08,705
Hangyeol's occupation is.

860
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,464
She seems like the type of person who...

861
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:11,770
But when she talks,

862
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:13,475
she seems very emotional.

863
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:14,963
I think she's a writer.

864
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:16,577
She looks like a writer.

865
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:18,409
Yeah, a writer.

866
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:21,068
Or music.

867
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:22,853
- Music?
- Yes.

868
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,767
You seem like a very logical person.

869
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:28,989
A PhD student.

870
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,736
(An occupation that seems possible)

871
00:37:32,261 --> 00:37:34,230
Do I have to answer?

872
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:35,983
- There's a correct one, right?
- There's a correct answer?

873
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:36,990
Then you don't have to.

874
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,027
- Your expression...
- If there is, you don't have to answer.

875
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:43,657
We've got one.

876
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:46,647
It will be revealed soon.

877
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,649
- Revealing it...
- There's nothing if you don't say it.

878
00:37:51,596 --> 00:37:53,353
That surprised us.

879
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:55,703
Right now I am

880
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:57,128
heading towards my goal.

881
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:59,654
So it's fun. It's okay.

882
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:03,056
This is where you can't guess anything.

883
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,452
The two of them might have separated.

884
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,127
- That's right.
- No one knows.

885
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:08,448
To be honest,

886
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:10,657
I didn't choose either of them.

887
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,789
Among us here

888
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,210
chose one of those two

889
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:16,240
so the situation turned out like this,

890
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:17,413
doesn't that mean out of

891
00:38:17,438 --> 00:38:18,833
the four people besides me,

892
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,076
they must like one of those two?

893
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:23,150
Separate them.

894
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,713
- Why? For what?
- For fun.

895
00:38:27,216 --> 00:38:28,982
- Hey, it's fun.
- For fun.

896
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,585
Aren't those who like fun

897
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,533
not irritated?

898
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:35,409
The person we chose went on a date.

899
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:37,630
So I, to be honest,

900
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:39,356
when I saw it, mmm...

901
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:41,376
And I can sleep well.

902
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,183
Because the person I like is still here.

903
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:47,407
Yes.
(Smiles)

904
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,629
That's it.

905
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:50,557
I'm curious about something too.

906
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,899
We wrote letters, right?

907
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:54,291
What was the standard?

908
00:38:54,363 --> 00:38:55,829
Just physical attraction.

909
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,150
Yeah,

910
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:58,653
I think it was like that for me too.

911
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:02,216
The vibe they gave off was my style.

912
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:06,687
But that’s just the first impression.

913
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:09,162
I don't know how she'll change.

914
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:12,273
- Yes.
- So I want to get to know her better.

915
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:14,995
But it was too sudden.

916
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,186
If we had written at night,

917
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:17,538
I would’ve chosen someone else.

918
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,246
- Me too.
- Right?

919
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,565
I definitely would’ve

920
00:39:20,572 --> 00:39:21,865
picked someone else.

921
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:25,666
- If it was written at night.
- Mm.

922
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,251
Raise your hand if you would've picked

923
00:39:29,331 --> 00:39:31,438
- someone else at night.
- Me.

924
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,039
I would have chosen differently.

925
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,216
If I had to write

926
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:36,592
my first feeling at night,

927
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:37,889
I'd probably choose Dagyo

928
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,469
from the start.

929
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:44,876
(Where are their hearts going?)

930
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:52,459
- Let's clean up if we're done eating?
- Good idea.

931
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:54,741
- Good idea.
- Let's help each other.

932
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:56,793
Three people, go ahead.

933
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:58,679
Go in a group. All together.

934
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:00,341
I didn't do anything.

935
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:01,923
Go ahead.

936
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,245
I'll wash the dishes myself.

937
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:07,067
Why did you roll up your sleeves?

938
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,770
Seoyeon and I have agreed to do it.

939
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:11,406
Leave already.

940
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,794
- Leave it.
- Geez.

941
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,956
Seoyeon and I have agreed to do it.

942
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,440
I like that it's casual.

943
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:21,942
It doesn't feel like we're being filmed.

944
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,678
Mirang made a delicious soup.

945
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:26,725
And I also got a chance

946
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,518
to talk to Dagyo.

947
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:30,998
We got to sit together and eat together.

948
00:40:31,036 --> 00:40:32,330
So I think it looked like

949
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:33,801
we had a good time.

950
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:35,949
I think that was nice in its own way.

951
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,386
I ended up staying with five people,

952
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:40,303
and I think I really enjoyed it.

953
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,377
On the first day,

954
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,080
since there was no certainty,

955
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:45,636
I thought it was definitely good to

956
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:47,289
spend time with the majority.

957
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,726
It creates new opportunities.

958
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,643
So I was able to discover the charm

959
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:53,268
of those who stayed.

960
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,596
That’s why I liked it.

961
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,780
It's so cold.

962
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:01,922
Don't you think so?

963
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:03,269
Do you have a sweater?

964
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,439
A sweater? It's in the other room.

965
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:07,441
- Wait a minute.
- But just a moment.

966
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:09,883
Hangyeol.

967
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,830
- Put this on first.
- Thank you.

968
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:12,863
(Mirang gave a sweater to Dagyo)

969
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,314
- Hangyeol.
- Yes?

970
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:15,442
Put this on first.

971
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:16,937
Wait a minute.

972
00:41:18,105 --> 00:41:20,580
(Hangyeol who's unaware
is picking a sweater for Dagyo)

973
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:23,101
Yay!

974
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,164
(Satisfied)

975
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:29,215
Then I'll wear this one..

976
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:30,889
You got it, huh?

977
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:34,175
(Hangyeol suddenly changed seats)
I want to brush my teeth.

978
00:41:34,223 --> 00:41:35,843
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Go ahead and brush.

979
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:41,601
(Thud)

980
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:47,326
Spending a whole week together

981
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:48,964
makes me feel kind of fluttery.

982
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,211
Me too. It doesn't seem real.

983
00:41:51,294 --> 00:41:53,826
- Yeah.
- I realized it when I was writing.

984
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:57,771
- They suddenly told us to write.
- Yeah.

985
00:41:57,798 --> 00:41:59,780
- I'm going crazy.
- But...

986
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,108
(Two people who are closer after dinner)
I'm totally confused.

987
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:04,163
It feels weird.

988
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:07,968
Do I have to be alone?

989
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:10,522
Then I'll stay until

990
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,222
everyone else arrives.

991
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,283
- Alright.
- When they come,

992
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,943
then I'll leave.

993
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:20,095
(Mirang taking care of
Dagyo who's alone)

994
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:23,617
It's quite warm here.

995
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:26,892
I just took a photo

996
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,452
and made it into wallpaper.

997
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:29,810
- Wow!
- A wallpaper.

998
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:32,819
So I can remember the names.

999
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:33,875
(Cute)

1000
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:36,675
- Name.
- So I can remember the names.

1001
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:39,092
It's impressive. Like this.

1002
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:41,589
Can you remember all of them?

1003
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,976
Of course.

1004
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:45,120
But I'm afraid of getting it wrong,

1005
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,493
so I'm afraid.

1006
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:52,379
(Dagyo who disappeared for a while)

1007
00:42:57,086 --> 00:42:58,331
Hello.

1008
00:42:58,393 --> 00:42:59,900
I'm done brushing my teeth.

1009
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,704
It's like the first time we met.

1010
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:05,965
- Right.
- Hello.

1011
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,420
Hello.

1012
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:10,597
But you really look like a writer.

1013
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:12,746
I won't say anything.

1014
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,681
Seems fun.

1015
00:43:15,419 --> 00:43:16,523
How so?

1016
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,103
I'm curious

1017
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,960
about what kind of work do you do?

1018
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:22,582
Have a chat with me then.

1019
00:43:22,689 --> 00:43:24,357
I want to get to know you

1020
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:26,062
a little as a person.

1021
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:30,027
(Me?)
Huh?

1022
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,579
(Weird eye contact)

1023
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:40,554
Why am I so embarrassed?

1024
00:43:42,726 --> 00:43:44,336
It's like being confessed.

1025
00:43:46,747 --> 00:43:50,070
(A strange silence between
the two of them)

1026
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,136
Have you thought about

1027
00:43:54,157 --> 00:43:55,063
what to wear tomorrow?

1028
00:43:55,088 --> 00:43:56,049
I'm just planning to wear

1029
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:57,156
whatever I grab first.

1030
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:59,925
They brought a lot of stuff to my room.

1031
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,869
What to do about that?

1032
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:05,416
How are the two going to sleep tonight?

1033
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,780
It's weird for two people
to sleep together.

1034
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:08,359
Sleeping in the same bed would be weird.

1035
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,166
Right.

1036
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,964
Just sleep on the same bed.

1037
00:44:11,006 --> 00:44:12,006
Is that so?

1038
00:44:12,118 --> 00:44:14,368
It's not like sleeping with someone.

1039
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:16,187
Dagyo, a room for

1040
00:44:16,194 --> 00:44:18,073
three people isn't good.

1041
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:20,300
- I didn't think it would be like this.
- That's right.

1042
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,470
But wouldn't it be strange

1043
00:44:22,697 --> 00:44:24,377
if both of them stay together?

1044
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,896
Wouldn't it be better if I was

1045
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:27,242
the one who chose?

1046
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:28,486
Choose to sleep first.

1047
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:30,000
Go ahead and sleep.

1048
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:31,283
Who will sleep next to me?

1049
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:33,059
I think that would be better.

1050
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,576
If there's nothing, sleep together.

1051
00:44:34,596 --> 00:44:35,958
Something along that line.

1052
00:44:35,982 --> 00:44:37,772
(Worried)
Just choose.

1053
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:38,993
Seriously...

1054
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,249
Should we go?

1055
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,457
- Building number one.
- Yes.

1056
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:45,203
Good job.

1057
00:44:45,622 --> 00:44:47,160
Good job.

1058
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:53,412
- We're here.
- You guys are here.

1059
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,928
- Both of you are back?
- Yes.

1060
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:56,443
We'll have to take care of this.

1061
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:58,051
Let's pretend to be shocked. Oh!

1062
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,962
(Heeyoung and Jinah are back
to Together house)

1063
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:02,957
I want to try washing it.

1064
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:05,512
- Hello.
- Hello.

1065
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,713
What did you two do?

1066
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:08,543
They were still talking.

1067
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:12,405
Hurry up and come.

1068
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:16,570
- What were you talking about?
- Must be cold.

1069
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:19,599
I'm back.

1070
00:45:21,189 --> 00:45:23,001
What are you eating? I want to know.

1071
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:27,334
Grilled fish set meal?

1072
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:29,723
It's definitely delicious.

1073
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:33,580
Stir-fried pork, mackerel, swordfish.

1074
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:36,249
- And rice, seaweed soup.
- I love them the most.

1075
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:39,472
- Seaweed soup.
- Really.

1076
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:40,903
So after eating...

1077
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:43,957
Dagkyo, what to do?

1078
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:46,419
We took good care of her.

1079
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,487
Right? Are you happy, Dagyo?

1080
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:50,235
It must be fun.

1081
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,635
I'm curious what you did today,

1082
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,700
I should ask.

1083
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:56,790
Seoyeon, you're suddenly so quiet.

1084
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:58,695
Should I switch your seat?

1085
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,701
- Your seat’s kind of...
- It's fine.

1086
00:46:02,256 --> 00:46:04,050
- Stuck way out at the end.
- Are you feeling sick?

1087
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:05,636
No. It's okay.

1088
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:09,103
So this is what it feels like.

1089
00:46:10,176 --> 00:46:13,266
(Soyeon who looked bad when she saw Heeyoung return)
So this is what it feels like.

1090
00:46:13,734 --> 00:46:14,882
This is what it feels like.

1091
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:16,735
I think I just kept thinking about it.

1092
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,289
That shock from earlier,

1093
00:46:19,723 --> 00:46:20,772
when I first heard it,

1094
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:21,825
I can't forget it.

1095
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:24,513
But now I’m kind of getting used to it.

1096
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,128
I’m even comfortable now.

1097
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:27,233
- Right?
- Yes.

1098
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:28,955
It’s not awkward anymore now. Just...

1099
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:32,258
- I laughed too much.
- Something’s coming.

1100
00:46:33,596 --> 00:46:35,174
This sound feels like an ad, seriously.

1101
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:40,270
(Use the cards in the living room
to get to know each other better)

1102
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:45,779
(Cards that makes us
know each other better)

1103
00:46:47,428 --> 00:46:49,196
- Let's begin.
- Let’s take turns.

1104
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:50,595
- Should I go first?
- Sure.

1105
00:46:52,665 --> 00:46:54,020
There’s no pink one.

1106
00:46:54,902 --> 00:46:57,130
- At a time like this...
- You love pink.

1107
00:46:57,895 --> 00:46:59,091
This one then.

1108
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:05,271
What’s your definition of cheating?

1109
00:47:05,552 --> 00:47:06,692
There are a small letters.

1110
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:07,852
If the other party cheats,

1111
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:09,546
will you be able to forgive them?

1112
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,672
But is this possible?

1113
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:13,873
(Already angry from just thinking)

1114
00:47:14,028 --> 00:47:16,837
What’s your definition of cheating?

1115
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:18,072
Definition of cheating?

1116
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,140
When I get stressed by the other person

1117
00:47:20,165 --> 00:47:22,298
is already considered cheating.

1118
00:47:23,117 --> 00:47:26,119
When I start loving someone,

1119
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:27,403
it takes me a long time.

1120
00:47:27,436 --> 00:47:28,836
There needs to be a reason why

1121
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:30,146
this person has to be the one for me.

1122
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,699
Like, I want to be the one for them too.

1123
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:34,093
But when I realize that

1124
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,986
they’d be okay without me...

1125
00:47:36,384 --> 00:47:37,423
You consider it cheating?

1126
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,103
Making me pay attention

1127
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,418
to these things.

1128
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,485
(Nods)

1129
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:45,569
- Ah.
- Okay.

1130
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:47,711
And the person you went on a date with,

1131
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,568
what’s your definition of cheating?

1132
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:50,911
Cheating...

1133
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,162
(Curious)

1134
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,950
Something that made the other person

1135
00:47:55,975 --> 00:47:57,655
really upset or hurt?

1136
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,580
For me, it’s just cheating.

1137
00:47:59,906 --> 00:48:02,227
For me, secretly contacting someone

1138
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:04,640
behind my back clearly.

1139
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,320
- Clearly.
- Clearly. Something like that.

1140
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,822
- Can clearly tell.
- Or secretly meeting.

1141
00:48:08,882 --> 00:48:10,031
Something that anyone see as cheating.

1142
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:12,062
Physically, or something like that.

1143
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,181
If it’s that obvious,

1144
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:15,881
then I think that’s cheating.

1145
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,136
Me?

1146
00:48:18,138 --> 00:48:20,013
Why are you looking at me like that?

1147
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,143
Someone I was suspicious of.

1148
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:26,345
- I told them I didn’t like it.
- Right.

1149
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:28,602
- That's right.
- But they still chose that person.

1150
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:30,643
- Right.
- They went to meet them.

1151
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,026
Saying they’ve been friends

1152
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:33,086
for a really long time,

1153
00:48:33,107 --> 00:48:34,652
don't you understand?

1154
00:48:34,676 --> 00:48:36,256
That’s so infuriating.

1155
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,327
After listening,

1156
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:39,246
I felt it and got angry too.

1157
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,855
- You've been through it.
- I’ll talk about that later.

1158
00:48:41,857 --> 00:48:43,229
I’ll talk about that later.

1159
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:48,141
For me, if you’re in a relationship,

1160
00:48:48,147 --> 00:48:49,776
and they meet someone else

1161
00:48:49,816 --> 00:48:52,630
and they didn't dare to meet openly.

1162
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,051
That means they have feelings

1163
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:55,152
for that person,

1164
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:56,666
they chose to change their mind.

1165
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,513
Cheating is when two people have already

1166
00:48:58,538 --> 00:49:00,122
given their hearts to each other,

1167
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,093
yet one still makes the other jealous,

1168
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,876
wanting to claim this person's heart

1169
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:07,840
while refusing to let the other one go.

1170
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,056
That kind of behavior is just cheating.

1171
00:49:10,431 --> 00:49:11,524
What about Seoyeon?

1172
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,934
Mine is the same as you, Dagyo.

1173
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,220
I believe people can

1174
00:49:16,228 --> 00:49:18,561
experience emotional fluctuations,

1175
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:19,982
but what truly matters is

1176
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:21,536
how they act on them.

1177
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:23,179
That's where standards come in.

1178
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:25,465
If you’ve been cheated on,

1179
00:49:25,735 --> 00:49:28,750
has anyone ever forgiven their partner?

1180
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,210
For me, no way.

1181
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:34,027
- What about Mirang?
- No.

1182
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:35,148
No?

1183
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:36,989
- Never?
- You have?

1184
00:49:37,253 --> 00:49:40,148
- Yes, I did.
- But this this count as forgiving?

1185
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:41,578
They broke up with that person

1186
00:49:41,618 --> 00:49:43,298
and came back to me. Does this count?

1187
00:49:43,515 --> 00:49:45,211
- You forgave them.
- You forgave them.

1188
00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:46,410
- Exactly.
- I knew it.

1189
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,108
Forgave and got the role of a fool.

1190
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:51,571
- I’ve seen for that before.
- Really?

1191
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:53,127
I'd be unable to.

1192
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:54,217
No feelings left for them.

1193
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,589
But they never came back.

1194
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:58,811
Even if they wanted to forgive,

1195
00:49:58,836 --> 00:49:59,836
- they couldn’t.
- Me too.

1196
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:02,529
Do you still feel the same now?

1197
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:03,656
For me, no.

1198
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:05,926
- Cheating and forgiving.
- For me...

1199
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,638
If I still have feelings for them,

1200
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,236
not for the other person’s sake,

1201
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,319
but for my own,

1202
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:11,763
I might actually consider saying,

1203
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:12,790
‘Come back.’

1204
00:50:13,137 --> 00:50:14,637
After all, everyone sees
things differently.

1205
00:50:14,661 --> 00:50:16,510
Everyone does see things differently.

1206
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:18,231
Turns out Hangyeol

1207
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,282
isn’t as old-fashioned as I thought.

1208
00:50:22,468 --> 00:50:24,114
I’m the more conservative one here.

1209
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:26,704
This is kind of thing...

1210
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:28,648
How about alcohol?

1211
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:31,157
How about drinking while playing?

1212
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,246
- Then I'll...
- How about bringing some wine?

1213
00:50:34,436 --> 00:50:35,842
I'll go get it.

1214
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:38,076
Everyone likes to drink alcohol.

1215
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:40,420
It seems alcohol is necessary.

1216
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:43,267
- These shoes?
- Yes.

1217
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:46,265
- I really want these shoes.
- Really?

1218
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:49,182
I saw them in the other room.

1219
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:51,297
Did they secretly put the

1220
00:50:51,304 --> 00:50:54,187
pretty pink shoes for me to wear?

1221
00:50:54,474 --> 00:50:56,676
Since I like pink, so it's Jin-jin pink.

1222
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:59,016
About YouTube...

1223
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,720
I was going to tell you later.

1224
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:02,010
I watch your videos while showering

1225
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:02,892
- every morning.
- Really?

1226
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:04,662
But because I’m in the shower

1227
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:06,062
it’s loud,

1228
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:07,840
- so I can’t hear well.
- Word.

1229
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,909
I just ended up watching your face.

1230
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:13,036
Not much different from YouTube?

1231
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:14,287
Actually,

1232
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,376
you’re way better in real life.

1233
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:18,004
Really? That’s so nice to hear.

1234
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:21,476
What do you want to drink?

1235
00:51:21,627 --> 00:51:24,190
This drink, right? Okay.
(Jinah and Mirang quickly become close)

1236
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:26,039
- Okay.
- There's mackerel.

1237
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:27,708
Gonna eat it too?

1238
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,983
For me, looks are important,

1239
00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:32,800
But I like people who are passionate,

1240
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,923
people who are dedicated to their work.

1241
00:51:34,947 --> 00:51:37,130
When I watch Jinah's YouTube videos,

1242
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,018
she speaks really well.

1243
00:51:39,118 --> 00:51:41,707
She's dedicated to her work.

1244
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:42,972
She's a passionate person,

1245
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,786
someone who does things with confidence.

1246
00:51:44,816 --> 00:51:46,709
I find it very attractive.

1247
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,990
When Mirang said she knew me,

1248
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,623
two thoughts crossed my mind.

1249
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:54,485
First, she does understand me

1250
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:55,944
better than others,

1251
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,736
so we could probably have

1252
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:59,519
deeper conversations faster.

1253
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:01,554
And the other thought was...

1254
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:03,042
Since she already knows me,

1255
00:52:03,116 --> 00:52:05,485
would she start questioning me?

1256
00:52:05,617 --> 00:52:06,683
Those two ideas kept

1257
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,304
swirling in my head.

1258
00:52:09,297 --> 00:52:11,230
- Wow.
- Look at that.

1259
00:52:11,557 --> 00:52:13,272
- I brought glasses.
- That's great.

1260
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:14,833
We're so serious about this.

1261
00:52:16,152 --> 00:52:19,955
(Wine and beer that help create the atmosphere)

1262
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:22,638
The first glass.

1263
00:52:22,663 --> 00:52:25,084
- Nice to meet you.
- Good job.

1264
00:52:25,105 --> 00:52:26,450
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

1265
00:52:27,886 --> 00:52:29,516
(Gulp)

1266
00:52:31,158 --> 00:52:33,024
(Empty glass)

1267
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,653
(Continues playing the cards)

1268
00:52:38,306 --> 00:52:40,052
Is there something that

1269
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,877
makes you fall for someone?

1270
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,616
I’m curious about that.

1271
00:52:43,673 --> 00:52:45,426
This is the most important question.

1272
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,460
Geez.

1273
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:49,301
This is so fun to watch.

1274
00:52:49,322 --> 00:52:51,434
Things that make you fall for someone.

1275
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:53,022
What kind of person do you like?

1276
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:54,042
That would be easier.

1277
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:55,802
Someone who does their work well.

1278
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,224
- But how would you know that?
- There hundreds of thousands of them.

1279
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:02,621
- Someone who does their job well
- I don't like lazy people.

1280
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,250
- must be determined.
- Yes.

1281
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:05,996
I think I’m really drawn to

1282
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,701
people with ambition.

1283
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,870
The thing that makes me

1284
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,415
fall for someone...

1285
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:13,412
Unexpectedly charming.
(Shy)

1286
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:15,927
- Unexpectedly charming.
- I think I understand.

1287
00:53:15,953 --> 00:53:18,578
- You said you know what it is.
- I have no idea though?

1288
00:53:19,193 --> 00:53:20,659
Well...

1289
00:53:21,259 --> 00:53:24,737
They seem really mature but a bit goofy.

1290
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:27,463
That's not a good thing, right?

1291
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:30,049
- Will it feel cute?
- It's cute.

1292
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:31,387
But is it right?

1293
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:32,780
This kind of unexpected charm.

1294
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:35,948
You're good at reading people.

1295
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:37,851
When you spend time together,

1296
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:38,858
you can feel it.

1297
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:41,074
I already felt it.

1298
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,275
Because I'm her roommate.

1299
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,840
We've talked a lot.

1300
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:47,578
From what I saw,

1301
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,418
Seoyeon's gaze toward Mirang...

1302
00:53:49,505 --> 00:53:51,104
I could totally sense those sparkling,

1303
00:53:51,124 --> 00:53:52,459
adorable eyes from her.

1304
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:53,568
So I was like.

1305
00:53:53,593 --> 00:53:56,721
'Wait, has Seoyeon
already chosen Mirang?'

1306
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,751
Is that why she said that?

1307
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,260
I'm the type who needs to feel

1308
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:03,696
that someone is genuinely loyal

1309
00:54:03,716 --> 00:54:07,153
and fully devoted,

1310
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:09,480
that's what would make me fall for them.

1311
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,620
And honestly, it's something

1312
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:13,389
I can confidently say

1313
00:54:13,414 --> 00:54:15,347
I value highly in myself too.

1314
00:54:17,686 --> 00:54:18,758
What about you, Jinah?

1315
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,900
For me,

1316
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,100
someone dedicated

1317
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:24,206
to self-growth is a plus.

1318
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,961
For themself and for my sake.

1319
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:27,868
I'd fall for them.

1320
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:29,397
Someone who has the mindset to

1321
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:30,857
actively improve themselves.

1322
00:54:31,323 --> 00:54:32,827
Someone striving to wake up earlier,

1323
00:54:32,972 --> 00:54:34,792
commit to workouts,

1324
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,198
or speak more thoughtfully.

1325
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:38,116
These are considered self-growth.

1326
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,599
If you just look at my SNS,

1327
00:54:40,926 --> 00:54:42,899
you might think I love to party, right?

1328
00:54:43,172 --> 00:54:45,578
But I'm actually the complete opposite.

1329
00:54:46,011 --> 00:54:48,251
So I like people who recognize that.

1330
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:49,946
People who see the real me.

1331
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:54,626
That's it.

1332
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:56,367
What about you, Dagyo?

1333
00:54:58,819 --> 00:54:59,839
I...

1334
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:01,667
I’m particular about scents.

1335
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:03,179
A pleasant natural fragrance

1336
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:04,538
can make me like someone

1337
00:55:04,563 --> 00:55:06,152
it doesn’t need to be fancy.
(Fans)

1338
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:11,477
- I didn't apply anything. Just kidding.
- Wait. I heard that before.

1339
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:15,044
More like a scent that fits their vibe.

1340
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:17,254
I actually remember people

1341
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:18,559
by their scent.

1342
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:20,103
There'll be tens of thousands

1343
00:55:20,123 --> 00:55:21,308
of scents tomorrow.

1344
00:55:21,332 --> 00:55:22,976
Oh my gosh, I'm going to

1345
00:55:22,996 --> 00:55:25,003
apply it from head to toe.

1346
00:55:25,485 --> 00:55:27,985
So, yeah. Another thing is...

1347
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,720
Someone who remembers things well.

1348
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:32,219
Like if I said something before,

1349
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:33,973
and I even forgot I said it,

1350
00:55:34,006 --> 00:55:36,829
- Yes.
- but they remember. Something like that.

1351
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:38,755
Also, just someone who is hardworking.

1352
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,355
Someone who puts in effort.

1353
00:55:40,726 --> 00:55:42,622
I think I really like.

1354
00:55:42,628 --> 00:55:45,604
I’m kind of like that too.

1355
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:48,254
Always full of passion.

1356
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,099
- That's nice.
- Something along that line.

1357
00:55:50,189 --> 00:55:52,285
And about communication,

1358
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,740
once we’re close, people often

1359
00:55:53,747 --> 00:55:55,480
say I’m fun to be around.

1360
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,237
- You’re already fun.
- Really?

1361
00:55:57,269 --> 00:55:59,045
- Yes.
- That’s a relief.

1362
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:01,200
Also...

1363
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:02,226
once we’re close,

1364
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,238
people say that I'm cute.

1365
00:56:03,262 --> 00:56:05,684
You’re already cute. What do you mean?

1366
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:07,847
I’ve also been told I seem

1367
00:56:07,854 --> 00:56:09,499
much more mature than my age.

1368
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:11,504
- You must still be young.
- How old are your friends?

1369
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,796
I don't know.
(Shy)

1370
00:56:17,779 --> 00:56:20,392
I’m the type who falls for

1371
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,659
sincere people.

1372
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:25,319
As for whether I have charm? Well...

1373
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:26,573
I don't know.

1374
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:31,492
I'm so shy,

1375
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,606
Why, winner?

1376
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,521
You can't do this.

1377
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:37,209
- I won't allow it.
- I won't allow it.

1378
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:39,472
I will win.

1379
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,720
But if I like them,

1380
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,429
it will be even clearer.

1381
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,258
- If I'm confident...
- Because I'm a straightforward person

1382
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,801
but I don't fall for someone easily.

1383
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,756
Did Hangyeol answer yet?

1384
00:56:50,816 --> 00:56:52,076
Appearance in the beginning

1385
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:53,349
then understanding later.

1386
00:56:53,373 --> 00:56:54,893
I see.

1387
00:56:55,247 --> 00:56:58,424
That was really concise.

1388
00:56:59,406 --> 00:57:03,132
The traits I usually can’t stand?

1389
00:57:03,405 --> 00:57:04,947
"I don’t know what to say

1390
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:06,957
"I don't know what you're thinking."

1391
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:08,991
"I couldn't enter your world."

1392
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,957
"I don't belong here."

1393
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:13,546
There was a lot of rejection like that.

1394
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,099
But there are people who

1395
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,799
understand and relate

1396
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,851
to those points, right?

1397
00:57:18,871 --> 00:57:20,462
Someone who approaches me because

1398
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:21,982
they want to understand?

1399
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:23,896
If they can make me like them,

1400
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:26,686
maybe it's mutual understanding.

1401
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,663
As for what makes me like someone?

1402
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,864
Looks, right?

1403
00:57:32,512 --> 00:57:34,692
Let’s be real,

1404
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:36,849
I won’t deny it.

1405
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:40,733
For me,

1406
00:57:40,978 --> 00:57:42,402
what I find attractive is...

1407
00:57:43,323 --> 00:57:45,177
I like people who are kind of cute.

1408
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:48,107
And if they seem rude,

1409
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,480
to put it bluntly, if they have

1410
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:50,766
bad personality, it's fine.

1411
00:57:50,796 --> 00:57:52,651
But if they're actually nice inside,

1412
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:54,216
I'm attracted to that kind of person.

1413
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,294
Even though they don't know

1414
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,439
- how to express...
- That's hard.

1415
00:57:57,556 --> 00:57:58,931
I wonder the same thing.

1416
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,867
- For me, the method matters.
- Me too.

1417
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:04,256
The way someone carries themselves

1418
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:05,863
being able to take care of themselves,

1419
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:06,889
that's one of the

1420
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:08,291
true marks of adulthood.

1421
00:58:08,315 --> 00:58:10,021
That's exactly why

1422
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:11,715
I could fall for someone,

1423
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:14,533
because I can teach them.

1424
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:16,501
I love helping fill in

1425
00:58:16,528 --> 00:58:18,474
what the other person lacks.

1426
00:58:19,232 --> 00:58:21,647
- So when there's a problem area,
- See?

1427
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:22,758
I enjoy being the one to

1428
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:23,972
complete what's missing.

1429
00:58:23,996 --> 00:58:25,796
What did you say when we were eating?

1430
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:27,241
You said let the

1431
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:28,483
other person approach...

1432
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:30,089
- Dependable.
- Exactly, exactly.

1433
00:58:30,282 --> 00:58:31,590
I absolutely love this.

1434
00:58:31,657 --> 00:58:35,568
- You like taking care of someone.
- Yeah. Despite that she likes it.

1435
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:37,474
If they entrusted their life to me,

1436
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:39,249
I'd be ready to take care of them.

1437
00:58:39,274 --> 00:58:42,568
- Really?
- I would take full responsibility.

1438
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:44,617
I can't do that.

1439
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:46,712
I like something like that.

1440
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:49,817
It's different from

1441
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:51,504
what I thought, Riwon,

1442
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,126
once she loves,

1443
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,263
she stays grounded and fully commits.

1444
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,556
It’d be really nice

1445
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,762
if I had a girlfriend like that.

1446
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:05,290
Is there anyone who didn't pick yet?

1447
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,450
I haven't.

1448
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,549
When things are hard, who or what

1449
00:59:10,563 --> 00:59:12,523
do you turn to or rely on?

1450
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:13,853
That’s easy.

1451
00:59:15,229 --> 00:59:16,308
For me...

1452
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:17,555
It’s my mom.

1453
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:20,601
My mom and I are like friends.

1454
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,808
- I talk to my mom about everything.
- Me too.

1455
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,880
My mom and I are very close.

1456
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:27,536
My mom and aunt.

1457
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:33,429
The relationship with your parents

1458
00:59:33,709 --> 00:59:37,510
are actually an important point for me.

1459
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,372
The image of a beloved daughter.

1460
00:59:39,398 --> 00:59:41,441
The image of a bright cheerful girl.

1461
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:43,393
I’m really weak to

1462
00:59:43,418 --> 00:59:44,813
those kinds of things.

1463
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,493
In that moment, inside my heart,

1464
00:59:47,562 --> 00:59:50,563
the sense of fondness just shoots up.

1465
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,245
I don’t rely on anyone.

1466
00:59:54,836 --> 00:59:57,089
- Why not?
- I like it that way.

1467
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,905
I have really strong resilience.

1468
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:01,560
- I don't really get sad.
- An optimist.

1469
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:03,395
- Really?
- But when I’m in a relationship,

1470
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:05,277
I suddenly become a lot more immature.

1471
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:07,106
That's how it is.

1472
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,162
Even though I usually

1473
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:09,125
feel fine being alone,

1474
01:00:09,149 --> 01:00:10,676
but once I start dating...

1475
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:12,301
I start thinking,

1476
01:00:12,326 --> 01:00:14,013
"why do I have such a hard life?"

1477
01:00:14,053 --> 01:00:17,523
Even though it's not hard at all.

1478
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,771
- Depending on another person..
- Even though I can fix it myself.

1479
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:21,740
- Something like that.
- Exactly.

1480
01:00:21,774 --> 01:00:23,470
But I don't rely on my partner either.

1481
01:00:23,502 --> 01:00:24,890
- Really?
- Yes, that's why

1482
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:26,410
I don't rely on anyone.

1483
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,910
You don't lean your back on anything.

1484
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:32,117
Actually, you sit up so straight.

1485
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:35,758
But people like this don't really

1486
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:37,665
feel that tired, right?

1487
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,847
- No. Well, I...
- No?

1488
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:44,683
I’m afraid when they're not there,

1489
01:00:44,963 --> 01:00:45,972
I won’t be able to

1490
01:00:45,997 --> 01:00:46,988
keep my balance alone.

1491
01:00:47,012 --> 01:00:49,562
- Oh.
- I'm shocked. That's quite...

1492
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,107
But when I'm tired,

1493
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:53,920
- Right.
- I should rely on someone,

1494
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:55,277
- That's right.
- but I can't.

1495
01:00:55,283 --> 01:00:57,249
- Please rely on us.
- Everyone answers like...

1496
01:00:57,397 --> 01:00:58,318
(Heart throbbing)

1497
01:00:58,341 --> 01:00:59,341
So sweet.

1498
01:01:01,098 --> 01:01:02,098
(Impressed)

1499
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:03,135
Almost crying.

1500
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:06,258
- So impressed.
- Why?

1501
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,687
- So impressed.
- Can't I?

1502
01:01:09,703 --> 01:01:11,669
Is there someone you can rely on?

1503
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:12,683
Is there?

1504
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,681
- It seems good to rely on someone.
- I depend on my partner.

1505
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,176
That face seems ready to rely on.

1506
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:19,197
- Rely on then.
- Dagyo's face is ready

1507
01:01:19,238 --> 01:01:20,201
to rely on someone.

1508
01:01:20,226 --> 01:01:21,732
I'll be sad it if they don't tell me

1509
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:23,303
about something that's troubling them.

1510
01:01:23,336 --> 01:01:24,630
You mean the other person?

1511
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,432
- Yes.
- I'm the same.

1512
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:30,375
At first, I relied on them too much.

1513
01:01:30,922 --> 01:01:33,084
And when they disappeared, I crumbled.

1514
01:01:33,253 --> 01:01:35,775
- So I shouldn’t be like this.
- Tried everything.

1515
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,317
So I decided, I won’t rely on others.

1516
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,259
But then the other person...

1517
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:42,181
- They will feel said, yes.
- They felt hurt too.

1518
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:43,289
Like Dagyo said.

1519
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:46,545
So I realized, don’t overly depend.

1520
01:01:46,918 --> 01:01:50,903
- But at least communicate.
- Balance is important.

1521
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:53,332
For this kind of person,

1522
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,832
watching someone change

1523
01:01:54,857 --> 01:01:56,239
when they become “my person”

1524
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:58,206
that process brings me happiness.

1525
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:59,605
I think it would be fun.

1526
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:02,528
Watching them become more strong.

1527
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,503
Because I waited and one day

1528
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,163
they relied on me like that.

1529
01:02:06,936 --> 01:02:09,134
The look in the eyes changes.

1530
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,318
You just went on a bright date.

1531
01:02:12,345 --> 01:02:13,643
While you were dating, is it like this?

1532
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:15,488
At one point when we talked,

1533
01:02:15,516 --> 01:02:16,769
her eyes will shine.

1534
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,470
Everyone gave such simple answers.

1535
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:22,949
How can I lean on my baby?

1536
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,451
- Okay.
- What?

1537
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:27,586
Wow, that's legendary.

1538
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,670
So sweet.

1539
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,465
I don't need anymore snacks.

1540
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,740
Baby?

1541
01:02:35,914 --> 01:02:37,742
Everyone expects to rely on them.

1542
01:02:37,756 --> 01:02:39,536
For me, that person’s existence itself

1543
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:41,630
is a source of comfort and strength.

1544
01:02:41,702 --> 01:02:43,535
- Oh my god.
- So I don’t need to rely on them.

1545
01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:45,697
- Just seeing their face makes me happy.
- Really?

1546
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,846
It's inspiration in my life.

1547
01:02:48,023 --> 01:02:50,508
So romantic.

1548
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,838
You said it like the first time.

1549
01:02:52,845 --> 01:02:54,690
You won't regret being with me.

1550
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,515
That’s right.

1551
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:58,990
- Right.
- That’s my view on love.

1552
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:01,873
They could’ve had so many other

1553
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:03,500
opportunities besides me,

1554
01:03:03,532 --> 01:03:05,491
- but they chose me.
- That’s right.

1555
01:03:05,518 --> 01:03:07,419
So you can accept cheating.

1556
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,055
So mean!

1557
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:13,120
I’m the type to hand over

1558
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,976
the power of choice to the other person.

1559
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,930
I don’t like that power returning to me.

1560
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,644
So whatever you do for me,

1561
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:23,273
I see it as what you accept

1562
01:03:23,286 --> 01:03:24,966
and your choice.

1563
01:03:25,187 --> 01:03:26,867
It fits my personality.

1564
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:28,270
I need to learn something like this.

1565
01:03:29,322 --> 01:03:31,683
I think there must be some

1566
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:34,712
- dedication in love.
- That's right, because it's love.

1567
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:36,180
If you love someone, don't you

1568
01:03:36,205 --> 01:03:37,535
naturally give them dedication?

1569
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,237
But this kind of changed

1570
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:40,617
with generations.

1571
01:03:40,678 --> 01:03:43,188
And is it right to love with dedication?

1572
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:44,923
Because people either think it’s about

1573
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,648
completely forgetting themselves

1574
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:49,693
or they focus only on winning.

1575
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:51,050
That’s really cool.

1576
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,390
To have such thoughts and act on them.

1577
01:03:53,824 --> 01:03:54,982
When it comes to love.

1578
01:03:55,756 --> 01:03:57,669
- Shall we pick another one?
- Sure.

1579
01:03:58,296 --> 01:04:00,562
Shall we pick another one?

1580
01:04:00,576 --> 01:04:02,322
There aren't many left now.

1581
01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:03,869
You're a really good host.

1582
01:04:03,896 --> 01:04:06,245
Yes, just like a host.

1583
01:04:06,736 --> 01:04:08,796
Then instead of asking everyone,

1584
01:04:08,974 --> 01:04:10,362
should we ask just one person?

1585
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:11,422
Pick one question?

1586
01:04:11,451 --> 01:04:12,637
- How does that sound?
- Sounds good.

1587
01:04:12,763 --> 01:04:13,515
Sure.

1588
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,907
I want to know what I'll get.

1589
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,657
- We'll know their personality.
- Really?

1590
01:04:18,946 --> 01:04:20,570
- Yes.
- Then I should try hard.

1591
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:22,868
I actually wanted to do this one.

1592
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,676
(Picking a question)
I'm curious about this.

1593
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:28,776
Shall we go in this order?

1594
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:31,196
I’m curious about all of them.

1595
01:04:31,382 --> 01:04:33,899
But we can only choose one.

1596
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:36,883
What’s your way of resolving

1597
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,039
dissatisfaction in a relationship?

1598
01:04:39,063 --> 01:04:41,563
Is there a method you’d like to try?

1599
01:04:42,082 --> 01:04:43,082
(Curious)

1600
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,899
Among everyone, I was most curious

1601
01:04:45,919 --> 01:04:47,119
about Heeyoung.

1602
01:04:48,756 --> 01:04:50,596
Honestly, I...

1603
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:52,531
try to resolve things by talking.

1604
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:54,490
“I felt like this when this happened”
kind of thing.

1605
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,050
Do you take time or say it right away?

1606
01:04:57,376 --> 01:05:00,699
- Talk about it right away?
- There's a big difference.

1607
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:01,987
That’s really important.

1608
01:05:02,048 --> 01:05:04,730
- Yes.
- Resolve things right away or not.

1609
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:06,325
But this kind of thing

1610
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:09,161
I have to see the other person first.

1611
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:11,370
It depends on the situation.

1612
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:12,516
Depending on the situation.

1613
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,633
The reason for the fight.

1614
01:05:13,658 --> 01:05:16,001
And how deep the relationship is.

1615
01:05:16,576 --> 01:05:18,222
I think about whether

1616
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:20,095
it’s something I can understand.

1617
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:22,407
I take that into account.

1618
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,541
But in the end,

1619
01:05:23,554 --> 01:05:25,754
I tend to talk about it quickly.

1620
01:05:28,077 --> 01:05:29,980
A method I want to try?

1621
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,950
Being more honest.

1622
01:05:32,776 --> 01:05:34,186
Without getting angry.

1623
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:38,377
- Yes, being angry...
- Being honest without expressing anger.

1624
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:41,242
I don't really see it. Even if I hear,

1625
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:42,275
I don't know what

1626
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:43,322
kind of person they are

1627
01:05:43,347 --> 01:05:45,060
and how they solves problems.

1628
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:46,231
(Thinking hard)

1629
01:05:47,556 --> 01:05:49,027
I'm on this side.

1630
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:54,320
- Upper one?
- Yes.

1631
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:55,821
(Turns)

1632
01:05:56,603 --> 01:05:57,989
The two of us disappeared,

1633
01:05:58,014 --> 01:05:59,747
they probably had fun.

1634
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:01,859
But I don't want to act like

1635
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:03,953
I have already made my choice.

1636
01:06:04,396 --> 01:06:06,932
I'm still confused right now.

1637
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,423
When it comes to loving and being loved,

1638
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:11,715
which one do you think is easier?

1639
01:06:12,465 --> 01:06:13,969
And the reason why it's harder.

1640
01:06:14,896 --> 01:06:16,876
The harder one is being loved.

1641
01:06:18,063 --> 01:06:19,978
That's what I think.

1642
01:06:20,016 --> 01:06:22,049
When dating or just the feeling

1643
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:23,630
of loving someone,

1644
01:06:23,655 --> 01:06:25,041
it's certain when

1645
01:06:25,062 --> 01:06:26,535
I love the other person...

1646
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:30,062
For me, having mutual feelings of love

1647
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:32,053
I think that’s something

1648
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:33,520
incredibly difficult.

1649
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,912
The whole process itself.

1650
01:06:34,939 --> 01:06:36,979
You all understand what I mean, right?

1651
01:06:37,003 --> 01:06:39,685
So, I think being loved

1652
01:06:39,818 --> 01:06:40,910
is harder.

1653
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:43,190
It might sound kind of odd, right?

1654
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,770
- No, you did well.
- Yeah.

1655
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:46,051
I'll give this...

1656
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:49,060
(Dagyo's question to Hangyeol)

1657
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,631
When do you feel loved?

1658
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,980
(Sneak a peek)

1659
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:56,954
I think it’s when someone is

1660
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:58,388
curious about what I like.

1661
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:00,317
For example,

1662
01:07:00,342 --> 01:07:02,728
“I want to watch your favorite movies.”

1663
01:07:02,761 --> 01:07:06,879
“The music you like lately.”

1664
01:07:06,893 --> 01:07:09,081
Things like that.

1665
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,278
It feels like expressions of love.

1666
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,703
(Nods)

1667
01:07:17,383 --> 01:07:18,263
That’s cool.

1668
01:07:18,283 --> 01:07:20,564
- What a structured thought.
- Exactly.

1669
01:07:22,934 --> 01:07:25,170
I see two people who are very sad now.

1670
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,986
- What question?
- Why are you looking at me?

1671
01:07:28,981 --> 01:07:30,627
You seem like someone
who’s been hurt a lot.

1672
01:07:31,544 --> 01:07:33,667
when you're feeling down, Mirang,

1673
01:07:33,692 --> 01:07:36,225
what’s something that makes you smile?

1674
01:07:38,442 --> 01:07:39,582
For me,

1675
01:07:39,602 --> 01:07:41,462
it's when my partner takes care of me.

1676
01:07:42,796 --> 01:07:45,470
- How?
- When someone keeps checking in on me.

1677
01:07:45,485 --> 01:07:46,485
Care.

1678
01:07:46,853 --> 01:07:49,420
- Taking care of you.
- Let’s go out and eat.

1679
01:07:50,113 --> 01:07:51,777
And if I don't have a partner?

1680
01:07:52,816 --> 01:07:56,008
I don’t really get in bad moods much.

1681
01:07:56,089 --> 01:07:57,029
Huh?

1682
01:07:57,624 --> 01:07:59,986
I used to be like that the past,

1683
01:08:00,013 --> 01:08:03,976
- but now I calm down quickly.
- Me too.

1684
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:05,504
I just sleep it off and feel better.

1685
01:08:05,802 --> 01:08:07,379
It doesn’t last long.

1686
01:08:07,494 --> 01:08:08,555
Honestly, it probably

1687
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:09,788
doesn’t even last an hour.

1688
01:08:10,276 --> 01:08:11,917
I’m too busy to stay upset.

1689
01:08:11,977 --> 01:08:13,003
When I think like that,

1690
01:08:13,024 --> 01:08:14,028
I instantly sleep.

1691
01:08:14,053 --> 01:08:15,356
Have you experienced it?

1692
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:17,522
When we rush forward

1693
01:08:17,642 --> 01:08:19,801
and burn out, it hits hard.

1694
01:08:20,258 --> 01:08:21,743
(Nods)
Digging my own grave.

1695
01:08:21,774 --> 01:08:23,929
I'll choose one day to be alone.

1696
01:08:23,956 --> 01:08:25,696
- Yes.
- Stay all by yourself.

1697
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:27,085
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1698
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:28,162
I'll have a day when

1699
01:08:28,196 --> 01:08:29,549
I won't leave the house.

1700
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:32,971
- Yeah.
- Stay alone, shut my mouth and sleep.

1701
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:34,029
- Yes.
- Cries.

1702
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:35,347
Totally.

1703
01:08:35,997 --> 01:08:38,537
- Live your life as usual the next day.
- Exactly.

1704
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:39,971
That's good.

1705
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,376
Mirang turned out to be more

1706
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,790
feminine and fragile than I imagined

1707
01:08:46,037 --> 01:08:47,303
someone who’s been through

1708
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,333
a lot of pain.

1709
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,210
Yet there’s still this

1710
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:52,170
genuine innocence about her.

1711
01:08:52,288 --> 01:08:53,445
Try to guess.

1712
01:08:54,128 --> 01:08:55,487
When you're in a relationship

1713
01:08:55,512 --> 01:08:56,948
between excitement and comfort

1714
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:59,074
which one do you value more?

1715
01:08:59,152 --> 01:09:01,123
For me it’s definitely comfort.

1716
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,362
- Comfort.
- Yes.

1717
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:05,717
If I don’t feel

1718
01:09:06,677 --> 01:09:08,260
comfortable...

1719
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:10,328
I usually won’t even start something.

1720
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:11,528
Is that so?

1721
01:09:12,223 --> 01:09:14,026
- That's unexpected.
- So different.

1722
01:09:14,629 --> 01:09:16,194
- For me, excitement.
- Excitement, too.

1723
01:09:16,451 --> 01:09:19,064
- My heart has to beat first.
- But it can change all the time.

1724
01:09:19,185 --> 01:09:20,215
- Yes.
- For me,

1725
01:09:20,228 --> 01:09:22,627
excitement is definitely nice, but

1726
01:09:22,747 --> 01:09:24,263
I hate the discomfort
that comes with it.

1727
01:09:24,303 --> 01:09:25,725
- Me too.
- Yes, me too.

1728
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:26,850
Like when I do something

1729
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:27,821
and wonder,

1730
01:09:27,846 --> 01:09:28,925
“What if this person hates me?”

1731
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,248
That’s also discomfort, right?

1732
01:09:30,283 --> 01:09:31,730
- Right.
- That kind of comfort.

1733
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:35,814
Next person.
(Seoyeon asked Jinah)

1734
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:37,960
You gave it to me because

1735
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:39,346
there's no one else, huh?

1736
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,706
Is there something you definitely

1737
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:42,436
want to do with your partner this year?

1738
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,098
Yes, I have something.

1739
01:09:44,123 --> 01:09:45,349
Actually, I go to Jeju Island

1740
01:09:45,374 --> 01:09:46,985
about once every two months.

1741
01:09:47,025 --> 01:09:49,615
But I don’t go for vacation,

1742
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,041
it's more for work.

1743
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,292
So honestly,

1744
01:09:54,346 --> 01:09:56,110
if I had a partner,

1745
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:57,557
I'd want to come here.

1746
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,544
When the weather is nice.

1747
01:09:59,603 --> 01:10:01,079
- Romantic.
- Something like that.

1748
01:10:01,104 --> 01:10:04,176
All the places I really wanted to visit,

1749
01:10:04,623 --> 01:10:06,489
I want to go and say

1750
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,609
"I really want to visit here."

1751
01:10:09,268 --> 01:10:10,268
That's nice.

1752
01:10:14,026 --> 01:10:15,827
- How nice.
- So fun.

1753
01:10:16,228 --> 01:10:20,504
(The first night in Together House where
they get to know each other better)

1754
01:10:24,109 --> 01:10:25,706
Oh, what is it?

1755
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:31,106
Again?

1756
01:10:31,942 --> 01:10:33,325
Huh? Again?

1757
01:10:34,613 --> 01:10:35,653
Everyone?

1758
01:10:35,688 --> 01:10:36,728
Everyone?

1759
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:38,249
Again?

1760
01:10:38,283 --> 01:10:40,113
(The message to them is)

1761
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,199
Everyone?

1762
01:10:43,664 --> 01:10:46,665
(Second letter to express
their feelings)

1763
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:56,299
I have chosen, I'll go straight.

1764
01:10:57,673 --> 01:10:59,769
I will be honest with my feelings now.

1765
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:05,020
(Where are the girls' hearts going?)

1766
01:11:08,618 --> 01:11:11,440
(Confusing feelings)

1767
01:11:11,513 --> 01:11:14,106
(Increasing excitement)

1768
01:11:29,675 --> 01:11:33,658
(Another woman who comes
to Together House)

1769
01:11:40,023 --> 01:11:42,113
Oh no, how to use it?
