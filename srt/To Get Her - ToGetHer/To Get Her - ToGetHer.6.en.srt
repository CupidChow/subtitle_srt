1
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:40,177
(O Park)

2
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:48,926
Huh?

3
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:54,175
(Baby vs Oneself cards)

4
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:00,868
Oh, a kid.

5
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:05,257
(What's the meaning
of the Baby vs Oneself cards?)

6
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,254
Eh?

7
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:10,564
Ms. Eun Eun.

8
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,256
What did you choose?

9
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,173
- Me?
- Yes.

10
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:16,924
(Cautious)

11
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,478
Why?

12
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,649
(A place where Minwoo arrives with caution)

13
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:25,956
(A dopamine exploding activity)

14
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:29,672
(A kart circuit where fun meets speed)

15
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,676
Let's try.

16
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:33,161
(No way!)
I'll stay over here.

17
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:36,016
I chose Ms. Hangyeol

18
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,605
but Ms. Riwon was waiting for me.

19
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,112
So at the time,

20
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,363
my only thought was

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,180
I had to defeat Ms. Riwon in every game.

22
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:48,034
- Damn, look at her changing places.
- What now?

23
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:48,938
(Riwon picks an advantage spot.)

24
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,498
- Why did you change?
- I picked first.

25
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:51,900
I get to pick first.

26
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:53,854
So I'll stay here.

27
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,031
Go ahead.

28
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,032
Ugh.

29
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:02,081
(Another woman arriving
at the mysterious kart circuit)

30
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:05,411
There are six cards.

31
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:08,095
Divided into Baby and Oneself.

32
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:10,301
Everyone can tell I'm a kid.

33
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:11,714
If I'd chosen Baby,

34
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,232
it would've emphasized my youth even more,

35
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,341
so...

36
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,597
I chose Oneself.

37
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,254
What's that? Ms. Hangyeol.

38
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,501
You chose Baby or Oneself?

39
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:28,185
I chose Oneself.

40
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:30,166
Wait. Can't I choose Oneself?

41
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,344
- Me?
- Yes.

42
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:34,685
I chose Baby.

43
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:36,061
Ms. Hangyeol, come this way.

44
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:38,799
No, no, wait. What is this?

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,009
They'll probably have us do this in pairs.

46
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:46,590
- In pairs?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,830
So who's paired up with who?

48
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,105
- Oh.
- Who's there?

49
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,879
- It's me. Why?
- Oh, Ms. Jinah?

50
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,769
(Dates with new partners?)
Why are there four?

51
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,903
Really?

52
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:59,741
What did you choose, Ms. Riwon?

53
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:00,792
I chose Baby.

54
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:02,944
That's right. I like kids.

55
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:04,179
I'm Baby too.

56
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,895
Am I the only one who chose Oneself?

57
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,166
(Revealing)
Oh, Oneself.

58
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,525
No, Baby, Baby.

59
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:11,916
Earlier two people chose Oneself,

60
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,527
one person chose Oneself.

61
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,403
- I chose Baby.
- Yes.

62
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,919
I thought it was a gathering of losers.

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,568
I thought Heeyoung didn't choose me.

64
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,853
Heeyoung didn't choose me?

65
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:28,162
That thought made me sad.

66
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:29,313
I thought,

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,650
"Good."

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,352
From what I see,

69
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:35,536
isn't this a gathering
of people who didn't match?

70
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,079
Really?

71
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,381
What?

72
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:41,120
Okay, is this a penalty?

73
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,618
(Depressed) (Stressed)
A punishment.

74
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,081
Go-kart?

75
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,950
(Heeyoung appears
in the midst of chaotic guessing)

76
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,306
(Are there five unmatched people?)

77
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,475
(Heeyoung, successfully choosing Oneself)

78
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:02,514
(This situation is getting
even more unpredictable.)

79
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:04,439
What's that? What?

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,863
There are only four karts.

81
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:07,767
(Confused)
Yes. So what now?

82
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,096
What the heck?

83
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,326
Are all losers here?

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,305
We're thinking we're losers.

85
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:16,377
Five people.

86
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:17,562
What's this?

87
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:19,274
Our conversation the other day

88
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,504
made me think she would choose me.

89
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:24,745
And on our way out,
she said again that she'd chosen me.

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,302
I think if those words were true,

91
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,927
there must have been a reason

92
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:30,181
for us to gather like that.

93
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:33,141
I think it's either that or she lied.

94
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:36,458
First of all, what did I want to say?

95
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,479
I was glad to see her because I was happy.

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,199
Will she choose me or not,

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,220
I don't know yet.

98
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,937
Hello there, but...

99
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:47,006
Heeyoung didn't look at me.

100
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:50,025
(Eh? What's that?)
Respect.

101
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:51,091
"What's that?"

102
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,929
I was thinking that.

103
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:56,103
Oh, we're all here!

104
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,898
What's this?
Is this an extra round of competition?

105
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,822
I'm confused. Confused.

106
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:06,880
Oh?

107
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,914
So Ms. Dagyo is also on the Team Baby.

108
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,530
Hi!

109
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,802
- Hello, Baby.
- Come on.

110
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:12,899
Oh, I didn't know.

111
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,940
You're all here?

112
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:18,897
- Ah, this is...
- What's this? Coming in just like this.

113
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,352
Dagyo. Are you Baby, Dagyo?

114
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,525
(Feigning confusion)

115
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,279
No, but I'm sorry.
You can hide it but we already picked.

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,161
What are you hiding? How can you?

117
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:29,024
I thought you wouldn't come.

118
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,861
I'm Baby.

119
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:33,710
Why are you this transparent?

120
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,292
I'm Baby.

121
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,259
What's this? What is going on?

122
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,480
I don't get it at all. "All tangled up."

123
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,561
I thought, "So tangled up
it's turned out like this."

124
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,803
That day was very confusing.

125
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,194
I tried to understand.

126
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:47,929
I want her. This person wants her too.

127
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,096
So gather them, right?

128
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:50,798
But why are we missing one person?

129
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,005
- Ms. Mirang?
- That's right.

130
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,269
A competition?

131
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,388
Did she get the most texts

132
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:57,238
so she's playing the
King game all by herself?

133
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,237
Hey!

134
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:00,330
Welcome!

135
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:02,059
Oh, Baby Mirang.

136
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:04,495
That's a giant Baby.

137
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,900
- Hello, Giant Baby.
- Giant Baby.

138
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,018
Oneself?

139
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,312
- No.
- Baby?

140
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:10,794
Because only Baby cards were left.

141
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,087
Seven people were standing in line.

142
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:15,461
I wanted to ask, "What is this?"

143
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,164
The situation is now very complicated.

144
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:21,237
Ms. Dagyo and I chose the same card.

145
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:25,150
So someone may like one of us,

146
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,205
or maybe they like both of us.

147
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,990
That's why it's all tangled up like this.

148
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,496
Who was it that Ms. Dagyo chose?

149
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,043
That's what I'm curious the most.

150
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,691
Baby... Eh? What are we getting?

151
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:39,620
Please check your messages.

152
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,465
Please check your messages.

153
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:44,843
On this date, you must pair up with

154
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,384
the person you want to go on a date with.

155
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:49,781
Compete in go-karting by teaming up

156
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:52,532
with those who chose the same cards.

157
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:55,879
The winning team will
get to go on a team date.

158
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:57,900
A team date of four?

159
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,053
(The tangled love thread)

160
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:05,194
(Hangyeol, Jinah, Heeyoung, Dagyo,
Minwoo, Seoyeon, Mirang)

161
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,250
(Team Oneself) (Team Baby)
Team Oneself, over here.

162
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:08,530
Ms. Riwon, this way.

163
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,078
- Team Baby.
- Team Baby, this way.

164
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:12,055
The child-like people are on Team Baby.

165
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,405
I didn't care if we won or lost.

166
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:19,187
As long as I was on the
same team with Ms. Dagyo,

167
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,377
I was fine with it.

168
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:24,814
Because I would get a date with Dagyo,
so I didn't really care.

169
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,888
Are you good at this stuff?

170
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,589
This? I never did this.

171
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,408
You seem to be good at it.

172
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,405
But that team

173
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:35,139
seems to have good drivers.

174
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:37,462
- Really?
- That team.

175
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,072
What? What's wrong?

176
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,649
What?

177
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,729
What? Bring it on.

178
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,130
I'm not good either.

179
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,517
We have to fight. Why
are you doing nothing?

180
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,658
As far as I know, they have

181
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,548
three good drivers.

182
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,836
No.

183
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:54,665
- We can do it.
- Can we?

184
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,205
We must win date privileges.

185
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,372
So what are we gonna do?

186
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:00,304
Hangyeol and I have to excuse ourselves.

187
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:01,869
(Hangyeol and Seoyeon can't drive)
We have to. - Yes.

188
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,149
If date privileges are
the prize, we must win.

189
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,750
People with potentials.

190
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:09,089
Anyway, I wanted Ms. Hangyeol on my team.

191
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,515
I wanted to see clearly

192
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:11,903
and I wanted to win.

193
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,621
I wanted to get her out of her shell.

194
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:15,711
I didn't know if I would have that effect.

195
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,074
I wanted to attract that.

196
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:21,031
Leadership that leads to victory.

197
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:24,216
(Round 1)

198
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,923
(Team Oneself: Minwoo & Seoyeon)

199
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,600
(Team Baby: Mirang & Dagyo)

200
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:31,829
Mirang, we must win.

201
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,651
Don't pressure me.

202
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:36,136
But people with long
legs are at a disadvantage.

203
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:39,349
I'm scared! I'm scared.

204
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,828
Seoyeon, safety first!

205
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:43,646
- Okay! Safe!
- It's okay to lose!

206
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,398
(Sad)

207
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,676
Go!

208
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,974
What the heck?

209
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:58,523
(Minwoo takes the lead.)

210
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:01,397
This is fun.

211
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,493
(Mirang increases speed.)

212
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,667
Oh.

213
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:09,831
But they're at different speeds.

214
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,284
Wow, very fast.

215
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,299
No, they're at different speeds.

216
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,395
Exactly.

217
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,477
No, take your foot off the gas a little.

218
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:17,783
- Really?
- It's scary.

219
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:18,828
I'm afraid.

220
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,079
Mirang!

221
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,436
Mirang, I'm so scared
I can't step on the gas!

222
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,472
(Mirang's right behind her.)

223
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:30,781
Whoo!

224
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,628
Let's go!

225
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,880
Hey, Mirang!

226
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,274
Faster!

227
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:37,151
I'm telling you, faster!

228
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:38,039
Mirang!

229
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,636
(Mirang turns the table at the end.)

230
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,621
Why is she so fast?

231
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:46,730
That's funny.

232
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,670
Why is she so fast?

233
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:50,305
(Seoyeon turns the table
while Dagyo's laughing.)

234
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,587
Oh, I got overtaken.

235
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,226
Hey, Park Dagyo!

236
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,321
Dagyo, you turtle!

237
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,129
Faster!

238
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,430
I'll come around after the sunrise.

239
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:08,561
I'm someone who comes with the wind.

240
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:13,116
(Seoyeon drives for
fun instead of victory.)

241
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:16,340
(Mirang's in the lead.)

242
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,754
(Followed by Minwoo.)

243
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:22,698
- Minwoo, step on it!
- She's right behind you, come on!

244
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:23,964
Step on it!

245
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,863
The karts have different speeds.

246
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:28,163
(Innocent)

247
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,551
(Current places: 1. Mirang
2. Minwoo 3. Seoyeon 4. Dagyo)

248
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,273
Mirang!

249
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:37,351
Mirang, she's coming! Step on it!

250
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,837
Step on it hard!

251
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:42,700
(A fierce competition)

252
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,847
(Glancing)

253
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:47,499
(Mirang doesn't see Minwoo.)

254
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:48,752
(Relaxed)

255
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,960
(Minwoo tries to pull ahead.)

256
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:53,116
Mirang, on your right!

257
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,120
(Finished?)

258
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,739
(Oh! What? What?)

259
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,641
(Reaching the finish line
almost at the same time)

260
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:06,077
- We won? We won, right?
- We won.

261
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,386
No.

262
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,612
Check the video.

263
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:09,950
- No, we won.
- Check the video.

264
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,116
No, no.

265
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,947
When were you behind me?

266
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,919
(Minwoo's sure of the victory.)

267
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:16,599
I... I...

268
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,872
I thought you were over there.

269
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:23,203
- At least I'm not last.
- Oh, you're fast.

270
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:25,779
Great job.

271
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,796
(Dagyo comes in last.)

272
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:29,575
Mirang, great job!

273
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,275
I thought she was far away.

274
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,185
No, but it's a close win.

275
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:37,163
No, we won.

276
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,004
At the end, we came in first.

277
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,039
- We won.
- No, no.

278
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,791
I came in first.

279
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,285
- We won.
- We won?

280
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,539
It's true. I insist.

281
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,638
We really won.

282
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,183
No, first of all, as I said,

283
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:50,777
it's clear on the camera.

284
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,346
I said it was an upset.

285
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:53,817
- Check the video. Check it.
- No.

286
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,499
Hey, I'm sure.

287
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:57,463
I think it was fun to watch.

288
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:58,925
A heated environment.

289
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,385
I think everyone was sincere.

290
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,592
If you take your foot off the brake

291
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,360
and accelerate again, it's like a boost.

292
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:06,288
- You get it, right?
- Oh, like KartRider.

293
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,889
So it doesn't matter how you take off.

294
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:12,630
Stepping on the brake
isn't always a good thing.

295
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,148
At each corner, try to turn

296
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,897
as close to the corner as possible.

297
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:17,998
Slow down a little then.

298
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,312
(Mirang's go-karting tips)
I see. Then speed up.

299
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:24,340
Go-karting for love.

300
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,120
Steering.

301
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:28,646
My blood was flowing so mischievously.

302
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:33,302
When I think about it,
to grab someone I love

303
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:36,021
and do something for love,

304
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,546
I felt, "What a good energy for me."

305
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:41,669
It fits the cute Kim Jinah perfectly.

306
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,414
I think about that a lot.

307
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:44,439
You can do it!

308
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,557
You can do it!

309
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,415
You can do it! Team Baby, you can do it!

310
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,037
Team Oneself, you can do it!

311
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:51,428
Oneself, you can do it!

312
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:52,980
Oneself, let's go!

313
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,557
Oneself!

314
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,878
You all are crazy for love.

315
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,011
- You love-crazed women!
- I love you!

316
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,565
Yeah, it was a very heated competition.

317
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:05,992
Heeyoung and I exchanged looks like this.

318
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,443
Everyone took it seriously.
They were crazy for the date.

319
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:13,134
(Round 2)

320
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,520
Come out.

321
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:20,263
I said to come out. Come out.

322
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,887
- Wow!
- Wow!

323
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:26,834
(A fierce battle to take the early lead)

324
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,337
- Come out!
- Move!

325
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:34,657
I knew this would happen.

326
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:38,641
(Hangyeol goes off the track
due to ineptitude.)

327
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:41,818
I followed the instructions
and went off the track,

328
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:45,800
so I thought, "I can't steer anymore."

329
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,102
(Hangyeol's out.
(Heeyoung represents Team Oneself alone.)

330
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,823
(Relaxed leaders)

331
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:50,824
Go!

332
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,256
Wow, that's our team. Go!

333
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,748
Wow, they're all on our team.

334
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,768
- What's Oneself doing?
- Go!

335
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,971
Oneself!

336
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,192
Okay, we can do it!

337
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,014
(Heeyoung's coming up quickly.)

338
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,375
(Crash)

339
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:05,036
(Unsuccessfully overtaking)

340
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,994
(Gritting teeth and trying again)

341
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:12,620
These speeds are too different!

342
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,405
Oneself, come on!

343
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:18,006
(Heeyoung beats Jinah
and takes the second place.)

344
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,007
Oneself!

345
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:21,108
Where's Ms. Hangyeol?

346
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,136
(Hangyeol sneaks out with difficulties.)

347
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,941
Ah, dang it.

348
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:30,651
I'm gonna crash again.

349
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:32,040
(Ms. Hangyeol goes off the track again.)

350
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,190
Help me.

351
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,695
I'm not doing it anymore.

352
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:41,987
No!

353
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:44,719
(Heeyoung uses the inside line)

354
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,166
(but the kart slides out.)

355
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,676
(Despite her attempt
to take the lead, she fails. )

356
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:52,313
(Heeyoung doesn't give up and tries again.)

357
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:59,171
(She finally turns the table successfully.)

358
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:00,944
You get it now, right?

359
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:02,768
(Taking the lead thanks to Minwoo's tip)

360
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:04,219
What's that?

361
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,660
When did that happen?

362
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:09,994
(Heeyoung takes the lead
with full confidence.)

363
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,003
What?

364
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,797
No!

365
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:16,586
(Heeyoung's exhilarating comeback win)

366
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:18,787
Everyone's too serious.

367
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:22,879
- Everyone's really too serious.
- I know.

368
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,601
Totally crazy for love.

369
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,217
Because everyone wants this date.

370
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,973
- I got the hang of it at the end.
- Right?

371
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,081
- I got stuck at first.
- You got my meaning.

372
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:32,160
Great job. Come here.

373
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,945
- I'm so impressed.
- Yes, you got it.

374
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,732
It got faster at the end.

375
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,465
(Heeyoung can't hide the joy.)
Great job.

376
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,680
Dang it.

377
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,078
No, no, I still don't know if I won.

378
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:45,193
(Hangyeol who still hasn't arrived)

379
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,052
- Who's that?
- That's so cute.

380
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:48,737
How are you? Not injured, right?

381
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:51,233
- When I bumped into you.
- Baby, did you crash?

382
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:54,320
- So I was worried at first.
- Where was there?

383
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,904
I bumped into the tires there.

384
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:57,958
Really?

385
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,959
Oneself, come on.

386
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,844
- Did you crash?
- I crashed twice.

387
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,889
Really? You're good. You're good.

388
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,498
You crashed awesomely.

389
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,039
You're not hurt, right?

390
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:08,561
- Did you hit your head?
- You're good.

391
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,155
No, no, I didn't.

392
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:13,081
- I didn't hit my head.
- Did you kiss the tires?

393
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:15,386
Yes, I crashed twice.

394
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:16,506
Really?

395
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:19,379
I was just enjoying the view.

396
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,787
After I crashed into the tires like this.

397
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:27,809
It's my signature move.

398
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,642
It was really hip-hop at the end.

399
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:31,740
It looked very fun.

400
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:34,677
This is women's fight for love.

401
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,459
- Ah, the result's here.
- Here's the result.

402
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,822
Ms. Mirang won the first round.

403
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:40,733
(Satisfied)
I thought so.

404
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:45,299
(There is a victory Mirang).

405
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,159
In the second round, Ms.
Heeyoung came in first.

406
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,908
- We must compete again.
- That's a relief.

407
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,199
Yes.

408
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:54,298
Let the winners compete.

409
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:55,333
Please win.

410
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,760
I believe I will win.

411
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:58,972
Long legs put me at a disadvantage.

412
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,435
Yes. Physical disadvantage.

413
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,980
Just step on the gas.

414
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,291
Understood.

415
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:05,093
Don't say anything.

416
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:07,297
Just do what feels right to you.

417
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,458
- You know this.
- They're babies.

418
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,800
You know the feeling, right?

419
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,505
You're a human, right?

420
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:15,726
Oh, excellent!

421
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,108
- You can do it.
- Our athlete.

422
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:19,202
(Massaging)
Our athlete can do it, right?

423
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:21,856
Give me a massage.
What are you waiting for?

424
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:22,955
That's true.

425
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,347
(Massaging)
I'll do it.

426
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:27,291
You can do it, right?

427
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:29,316
Oneself, go get it!

428
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:30,853
Oneself, you can do it!

429
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,293
(The final round with a date on the line)

430
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,712
(The final round to decide victory)

431
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:48,399
(Mirang takes the lead.)

432
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,650
What's this? What the heck?

433
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:58,000
(Turning the table quickly at a corner)

434
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:01,689
(Heeyoung, the goddess of go-karting,
gets the feel of it perfectly.)

435
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,932
Why am I this slow?

436
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,011
It's very slow.

437
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:09,076
(Hehe)

438
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,423
No, not this lap.

439
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,509
Oneself, great job!

440
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:15,809
Go, go, go!

441
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,761
- It's okay.
- This kart is very slow.

442
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:19,124
It's okay.

443
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,311
- This one is very slow.
- This one won't do.

444
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,772
Not this lap.

445
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,095
(Heeyoung's winning flawlessly.)

446
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,058
(Focused)

447
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:33,337
(Putting away from Mirang)

448
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:35,583
Ah, this is horrible.

449
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:39,386
Are you prepared for the moment of victory?

450
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:40,992
Of course.

451
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:43,085
- Who's that?
- Who's that?

452
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,207
Isn't the Queen of Jeju Island?

453
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,153
(Celebrating perfectly)

454
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:51,509
(Did you see?)

455
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,565
Look at her face.

456
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,255
So cool. Taking the victory with style.

457
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,106
My heart was racing just now.

458
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,482
What was that?

459
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,689
What were you doing there?

460
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,396
Go on a date with me?

461
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:06,295
Hey.

462
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,232
Let's go on a date.

463
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,735
Was that a drift?

464
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,543
Don't know. What did I do?

465
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:18,900
Very cool. To be honest, I fell in love.

466
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:22,549
This kind of competition
shows a person's attitude.

467
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,939
A well-curated image

468
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:26,231
is very charming to me.

469
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,072
(Competitive spirit,
&lt;Unconditional date&gt; Full of excitement)

470
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,538
Since Ms. Heeyoung
won in the deciding round,

471
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,574
Heeyoung's team takes the victory.

472
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:36,811
(Team Oneself wins.)

473
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:38,572
(The winners get a 4-person date.)
Thank you.

474
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:40,678
Let's go on a date.

475
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,133
We're gonna go on a date.

476
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:44,609
Yes. Goodbye.

477
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,368
We'll go home and relax in the warmth.

478
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:47,431
Yeah, that's the best.

479
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,967
Because it's cold.

480
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:50,624
Such a loser's talk. Let's go.

481
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,035
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

482
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:58,102
The four of us got a random date, right?

483
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:00,588
Honestly, as it turns out, I liked it.

484
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:03,606
This way I got to know new people

485
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,990
and gained new experiences.

486
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:09,461
I felt very at ease.

487
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:12,002
I wanted to stay away
from Heeyoung for a bit anyway.

488
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,334
Let her be free.

489
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:17,134
If I keep choosing her,

490
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:18,830
the end.

491
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,983
I've been thinking
it's more comfortable that way.

492
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:24,935
Personally, this time is necessary for me.

493
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,666
(Minwoo, Heeyoung, Hangyeol and Seoyeon
of Team Oneself depart for their date.)

494
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,451
But go-karting together

495
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:34,003
was a really fun experience.

496
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:36,743
After doing that today,
I want to do it more.

497
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,011
If I can.

498
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:40,090
I thought everyone went crazy for love.

499
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,665
I thought, "They were
really crazy for love."

500
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:45,061
When I saw that everyone

501
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:47,373
was serious about the game,

502
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:48,376
I got even crazier.

503
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:52,456
(Love-crazed women(?)
(savoring the feeling of victory)

504
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:53,967
But when you whispered to me

505
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:57,149
to reveal the unexpected tip,

506
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,711
I got hot. I wasn't cold at all.

507
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,883
Just on my right side.

508
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:06,862
- Just here? I felt hot just here.
- Got hot just here.

509
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,293
(Very excited)

510
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,901
(What kind of story will
their new experience lead to?)

511
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:17,446
If I spend time with
someone I don't know at all,

512
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,599
won't take require too much focus?

513
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,134
I used to cling to that bias.

514
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:24,810
But it seems to hurt more than help.

515
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:28,047
Turns out the bias gets destroyed.

516
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:31,682
In contrast to a quiet date.

517
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:35,320
This way we get to know
the other person better.

518
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,565
It may create an opportunity.

519
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:41,098
But don't activities
lead to more concealing?

520
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,018
- The nervousness of it all.
- Yes, yes.

521
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:48,198
I think no matter what,
a one-on-one date is better.

522
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:51,668
I think a date should
come with an activity.

523
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:54,989
In an unfamiliar situation,

524
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,128
you'll see the side of
them you've never seen?

525
00:21:58,129 --> 00:21:59,739
Exactly.

526
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,468
Everyone talks to each other.

527
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:06,291
Staying in separate dormitories
for a few days won't help you learn.

528
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,859
Seeing how people handled the game

529
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,439
- informs who they are.
- Exactly.

530
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,079
Like understanding the rules,

531
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,159
winning or losing,

532
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,339
accepting the result.

533
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,710
We got to see things like that.

534
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,115
It was a very good experience.

535
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:27,816
I liked this competition the most.

536
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:29,496
Feels like everything starts today.

537
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:31,345
I'll remember it for a long time.

538
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:35,699
Ms. Heeyoung is very cool.

539
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,306
Her demeanor when she did well
in the game was quite sexy.

540
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:44,413
(Heeyoung's new image
makes Minwoo's heart tremble.)

541
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:48,706
(Can Heeyoung feel
Minwoo's trembling heart?)

542
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,455
Oh, I'm taking the wrong way.

543
00:22:54,602 --> 00:22:56,611
Oh, this way gets us there too.

544
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:58,031
It does.

545
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:00,322
(Heeyoung calms Minwoo
to keep her from panicking.)

546
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:01,826
Is there a way?

547
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,942
This way?

548
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:07,184
- Wow, this road is scenic.
- I'm taking a U-turn.

549
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:09,341
Let's see.

550
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:11,119
Even better.

551
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,687
(A drive through the Jeju alley
that starts with a wrong turn)

552
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:15,419
A lot of ropes.

553
00:23:18,422 --> 00:23:21,077
This place is so nice.

554
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:24,568
We're so lucky.

555
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:28,426
- No, this road is very scenic.
- Scenic?

556
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:30,878
I love the tranquility.

557
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,220
- I must really crave tranquility.
- Really?

558
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:36,667
I'm someone who...

559
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:39,379
I'm very Type E.

560
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,894
I suspect we have similar habits.

561
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:44,325
- Me?
- Yeah.

562
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:47,916
You looked it when you arrived.

563
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:49,390
But at the time,

564
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,218
the three of us were super excited.

565
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,067
Everyone was already very excited.

566
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:54,544
- Yes, and...
- Wait.

567
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:55,792
When you arrived,

568
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:59,311
Because our room has three people,
so I got a little excited.

569
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:03,903
And they got close very quickly too.

570
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,223
- They were always talking.
- True.

571
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:06,417
Yes, so...

572
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:09,271
(Minwoo & Heeyoung laughing and talking)
I feel

573
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,250
(and uncomfortable looks in the back)
the three of them are my relatives now.

574
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:14,680
(Staying still)

575
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:17,060
It's hard for me to see them that way.

576
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:22,361
Huh...

577
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:26,330
Looks like a group date won't be very fun.

578
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,914
Then there will be no purpose of date.

579
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:31,097
Just...

580
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,164
I'm very worried about
two people at the houses.

581
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:40,123
(Seoyeon is still worried about
Mirang & Dagyo being together.)

582
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:44,488
Ms. Heeyoung is very active.

583
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:47,707
So it felt like getting on a free train

584
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:51,676
without much confidence
throughout the trip.

585
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:54,569
I was afraid of being seen
as a good-for-nothing.

586
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:57,846
Actually, at first I was a little scared

587
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:59,539
(Lost confidence)
and didn't do well.

588
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,825
(on an unfamiliar date)

589
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:05,606
(Heavy atmosphere and unusual silence
flowing through them)

590
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:09,380
(Four women with different minds
in a new situation)

591
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:14,967
(How will this confusion
affect them the future?)

592
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,414
You're a great driver.

593
00:25:24,415 --> 00:25:25,646
Am I cool?

594
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:27,882
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

595
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:29,403
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

596
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:48,356
Wow.

597
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:56,159
(A new setting, unfamiliar tools,
unprecedented excitement)

598
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,854
Goodness, that one's so beautiful.

599
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,722
(What do the hearts of
the four of them look like?)

600
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,267
- What will you make?
- That cup.

601
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:19,682
Cup? What kind of cup?

602
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:25,020
Um, just a normal, simple one.

603
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:26,991
This one.

604
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,173
(Going past)

605
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:31,955
What will you make?

606
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,029
I...

607
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:39,118
I like to drink, so I'll make a cup.

608
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:41,464
I think this style.

609
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:44,175
The cute ones.

610
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,426
(Getting to know each other while choosing)

611
00:26:46,427 --> 00:26:47,797
I like the traditional style.

612
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:50,576
This style is good too.

613
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:52,500
(In the meantime, Hangyeol looks pensive.)

614
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:53,618
What about this?

615
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:55,648
A cup is a good idea.

616
00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:58,878
(Hesitant)

617
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:01,419
Ah, it's over for me.

618
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,642
I failed

619
00:27:02,643 --> 00:27:05,379
at attracting attention
with certain things.

620
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:09,773
All the things that I can't do,
have they revealed themselves?

621
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:11,074
I'm in trouble.

622
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:18,197
(Seoyeon looks pensive as well.)

623
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:21,068
Vases. Vases.

624
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:22,092
Vases are good too.

625
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:27,564
(Concentrated)

626
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,918
I have to make this one.

627
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:38,386
I want to use this
opportunity to make a gift.

628
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,917
I'll give it to Ms. Dagyo as a gift.

629
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:47,525
(Seoyeon wants to convey
her feelings with a ceramic.)

630
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:50,781
(Will it be able to pass on
Seoyeon's feelings to Dagyo?)

631
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,378
Is this one cute?

632
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,676
This one? You'll do this one?

633
00:27:53,677 --> 00:27:55,099
I see, okay, got it.

634
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,919
It can go anywhere. At the house too.

635
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,395
Oh, okay.

636
00:27:58,722 --> 00:28:02,123
(Minwoo chooses the cup
Heeyoung recommends.)

637
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:03,923
- Where's my station?
- Where do I go?

638
00:28:06,026 --> 00:28:07,113
Okay.

639
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:17,243
(All four people are preparing
to make the piece they chose.)

640
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:21,690
(Expert)

641
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:27,761
(Hesitant)

642
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:31,219
How do I put this on?

643
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:35,389
Oh. Okay, okay. Like this.

644
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:39,629
(Minwoo helps the other two
who are still unable to wear their apron.)

645
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,630
It's okay.

646
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:43,752
Head through here.

647
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:47,755
(Being helpful)
Arms.

648
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:52,165
Sis.

649
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,013
Not this way?

650
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,423
(Hehe)

651
00:29:00,424 --> 00:29:01,561
Thank you.

652
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:02,562
Watch your hair.

653
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,366
Thank you.

654
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:10,662
I really want to see the result.

655
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:13,072
How do we make it?

656
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,068
(Pressing with one hand)

657
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:26,708
(Pressing with two hands)

658
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:32,102
(These women are making pottery
in their own styles.)

659
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:35,927
(Strangely uncomfortable)

660
00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:41,684
My hair got in the way.

661
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:45,314
(Heeyoung calmly making pottery)

662
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:49,201
(Meticulous)

663
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:53,472
Does everyone know how to make pottery?

664
00:29:53,473 --> 00:29:55,128
This is my first time.

665
00:29:55,551 --> 00:29:58,316
I've never done anything like this before.

666
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:00,783
(Peeking)

667
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:02,084
You're so good.

668
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,428
Huh?

669
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:05,058
When did you see that?

670
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:07,782
Why are you so good? How do I do?

671
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:10,449
When you make the rim, you have to

672
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,425
put a bit of pressure here.

673
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:13,810
(Staring)
Like this.

674
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:17,735
Ms. Heeyoung is perfect for making pottery.

675
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,009
Suddenly I thought
she was unexpectedly multitalented.

676
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,341
She's cool.

677
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:27,898
(The moment of seeing Heeyoung's new image)

678
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:32,268
Ms. Heeyoung is really good at everything.

679
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:35,033
I sneaked a few looks at her.

680
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:37,840
She's good at making pottery.

681
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,788
Gotta use a little force, right?

682
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,701
Am I being too light?

683
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:46,546
(Jittery)

684
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,275
What should I do now?

685
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:49,711
(Oops)

686
00:30:49,712 --> 00:30:51,940
Wait a minute.

687
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:54,232
I was...

688
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:56,654
Looks like I can't make this either.

689
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:59,984
(Pitiful)

690
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:01,220
(Noticing something)

691
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:02,638
I was busy looking just now.

692
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,881
Sis, looking at this one,
yours looks stranger.

693
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:06,513
My goodness. This is crazy.

694
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,612
(Confused)

695
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:11,813
It seems to have an identity now.

696
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,488
Wait a sec.

697
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:20,041
I thought I would be
good at making pottery.

698
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,353
Completely pathetic.

699
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:24,712
It was really difficult.

700
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:30,692
At first I'd thought
maybe I'd make it a gift,

701
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:32,260
but I gave up.

702
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:36,916
Hey, but do ceramics like that exist?

703
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,455
So how can we fix this?

704
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:43,534
(Minwoo helps Hangyeol who's in a bind.)
Not as good as before?

705
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,580
(Minwoo helps Hangyeol who's in a bind.)

706
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,379
Because I'm not skilled.

707
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,530
Oh, really?

708
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:52,939
(Oops)

709
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:56,397
- Goodness.
- What do I do?

710
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,334
Wait, take your hand out.

711
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:03,226
Wait, it can be fixed. Wait.

712
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:06,768
You should be making yours.

713
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:09,656
No, I want to make this
like it was before first.

714
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:12,086
I'm masking. I'm masking.

715
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,099
It's really unpredictable.

716
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,655
Just the way she pointed her hand
and kept using it to touch that dry clay.

717
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:22,061
Something like that was always in my sight.

718
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:25,470
Surprisingly, Ms. Hangyeol
is someone I'm worried about.

719
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:29,850
(Hangyeol's strange charm
that constantly makes you worried)

720
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:34,159
It's much better now, right?

721
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,694
I might ruin it again.

722
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:39,599
But is it necessary to
make it in that style?

723
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,963
I'm just wondering if
I can make it like that.

724
00:32:41,964 --> 00:32:45,679
Stop thinking about
the perfection of pottery.

725
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,803
I just wanted to make it hard like that.

726
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:53,547
Just doing this is enough.

727
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:57,994
(Hangyeol hasn't recovered
despite Minwoo's encouragement.)

728
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:02,542
At the time I thought
I'd ruined it for the second time.

729
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,231
But before that,

730
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:14,709
she'd sent me a signal that told me
my feelings might be reciprocated.

731
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,425
After that she said I was just really cute.

732
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:19,653
Like a little kid.

733
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:26,197
(How do Minwoo feel about Hangyeol?)

734
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:30,282
(Heeyoung's ceramic is taking shape.)

735
00:33:30,873 --> 00:33:31,873
Again?

736
00:33:32,993 --> 00:33:34,055
Well, I...

737
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:36,363
(Seoyeon's ungiftable ceramic)

738
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,078
I changed it to a bowl.

739
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,879
- Eh?
- A bowl.

740
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:44,213
- Just press down like that?
- Yes.

741
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,521
(Staying still)
Just once?

742
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:50,109
Everyone is something else.

743
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,799
(Minwoo's special ceramic)
Help me.

744
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,126
Why?

745
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,079
Please help me.

746
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:58,311
(Heeyoung moves to help Minwoo.)
What should I do?

747
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:00,069
(Heeyoung moves to help Minwoo.)
Don't know.

748
00:34:05,263 --> 00:34:07,923
You have strong hands.

749
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:12,968
At least it's better than what it was.

750
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:16,259
Thank you.

751
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,141
(Proud)

752
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:24,239
Yours looks the most legit.

753
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:31,041
(Hangyeol and Heeyoung are
charming in different ways.)

754
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:35,553
(Who will be the destination
of Minwoo's feelings?)

755
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:41,654
(The experience of making pottery
revealing new sides to everyone)

756
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,870
Mine is the best.

757
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,080
What did you say?

758
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:48,031
To be honest, the good one...

759
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,089
Heeyoung's is the prettiest.

760
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,232
- But I have to take pictures of them.
- Yes, let's take pictures.

761
00:34:54,233 --> 00:34:56,791
Because it's very funny.

762
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,206
Let's take funny photos for later.

763
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,157
- And share, right?
- Take them.

764
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:04,935
(Minwoo taking pictures of the
once-in-a-lifetime works (?) as souvenirs)

765
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:09,913
(The works that show
each person's identity.)

766
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:12,805
Now let's come together.

767
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:14,157
You know how to do that one?

768
00:35:14,604 --> 00:35:15,687
MC?

769
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:17,178
(Whoosh)

770
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:19,067
- Pics of hands. Okay.
- Put your hands out.

771
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:21,812
Oh, I see.

772
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,124
Why are you doing that?

773
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,188
(After the date, what
options will they have?)

774
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:33,422
(Team Baby has arrived at the houses.)

775
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,906
- I'm back.
- Welcome.

776
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,596
I'm really curious about who chose who.

777
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,858
What? How?

778
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:44,458
Why did they bring all eight of us?

779
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,939
Why don't we guess? When they come back,

780
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,088
- We?
- A game. Just a game.

781
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:50,723
I'll take an A4 paper
and we'll play a guessing game.

782
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:53,781
- Oh, good idea.
- Might be fun.

783
00:35:57,362 --> 00:35:59,204
- I'm just curious.
- What?

784
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,261
What I'm curious about you is

785
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:06,232
right now you choose Heeyoung

786
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,647
and only Heeyoung, right?

787
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:09,895
Oh, yes. That's why I asked her yesterday.

788
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:12,135
She said she wanted to know me better.

789
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,247
So you're not regretting
not knowing anyone else?

790
00:36:14,248 --> 00:36:15,878
- That's what I wanted to know.
- Exactly.

791
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,900
- Really?
- I always do that, but now...

792
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:19,649
Then be a little more on point,

793
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,289
so the two of you can be

794
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:22,785
- Like that.
- On the same page.

795
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:24,998
That's because she always says,

796
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,334
"We're here to get to know everyone."

797
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,628
But I think you're overthinking this,

798
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,071
afraid of being burdensome.
I think you can put away this feeling.

799
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,510
That's how I feel
after what she heard yesterday.

800
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,608
- Yeah.
- Okay.

801
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:39,703
Just put it away.

802
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:44,364
I think if it comes to that...
Why are you crying?

803
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,068
Hey, from what I see now,

804
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,610
you're under too much pressure.

805
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,637
"If I do this, will it burden her?"

806
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:52,632
You shouldn't feel pressured about that.

807
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:54,929
Really? I probably scared myself.

808
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,580
Right? That's what I think.

809
00:36:57,678 --> 00:36:59,309
I think right now you two...

810
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:00,739
Pointless?

811
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,589
If you're a little braver.

812
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,825
Just a little.

813
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:06,607
A little pointless.

814
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:08,984
From what I've observed, you two

815
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:11,607
should maybe have a serious talk.

816
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:13,690
You should let go of

817
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:16,100
the pressure a little bit.

818
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,892
- For me...
- Dagyo seems very mature.

819
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:20,374
Even though things
are tangled up like this,

820
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,404
the most important thing for each of us,

821
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:25,391
what we want to do,

822
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:26,959
just do it and ignore other people.

823
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,880
I just want to show how I feel right away.

824
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:32,469
What's so funny? Tell me.

825
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,443
- No, it's just funny.
- Why? I want to know.

826
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:40,682
Today, both of you
should go outside for a bit.

827
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:44,330
What's over there?
Open the door, go out on that balcony

828
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:48,224
and talk a bit.

829
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:52,159
(After a short advice session
between Jinah and Dagyo...)

830
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,598
(Mirang's lunch is ready.)

831
00:37:58,793 --> 00:37:59,990
Please enjoy.

832
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,832
I'm going in, chef.

833
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,269
The mini paprika is so delicious.

834
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,133
Ms. Mirang cut them carefully.

835
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:11,235
I think this soup is very delicious.

836
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:12,489
Yeah, it's delicious.

837
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,745
- Thank you.
- The soup is really delicious, chef.

838
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:18,211
I love this child-like date of our team.

839
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,232
Child-like date?

840
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:21,734
I love that we get to rest
at home during the day.

841
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,694
In a warm place like too.

842
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:25,992
Look at the weather outside right now.

843
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:27,040
We're not on a date.

844
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,707
I see the wind turbines over there.

845
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,548
A home date with wind
turbines on the shore.

846
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:32,211
I like home dates.

847
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:34,671
What do you think they're doing?

848
00:38:34,673 --> 00:38:35,712
I'm curious about that.

849
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,520
Do you prefer four-person food dates

850
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:38,948
or two-person food dates?

851
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,703
Two-person, of course.

852
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,063
I thought Dagyo and I

853
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:44,117
would look like fools in three days.

854
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,130
The two of us kept saying,

855
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:46,746
- "What?"
- "What?"

856
00:38:46,747 --> 00:38:49,108
But it wasn't like that.
Originally we didn't know...

857
00:38:49,798 --> 00:38:53,049
everyone's date choices
would be all tangled up.

858
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,688
Because we didn't know...

859
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:57,960
- it would turn out that way.
- We have to do that after lunch.

860
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,665
We're guess who chose who.

861
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:02,363
Shouldn't we eat and think
about it at the same time?

862
00:39:02,364 --> 00:39:04,119
- I just want a casual talk.
- But with words.

863
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:06,287
- I'd better write it down.
- Can't you just talk?

864
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:08,729
Wait, doing it while we're eating?

865
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,640
I think that...

866
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,286
Park Heeyoung...

867
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:17,717
chose Seoyeon.

868
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,999
I've seen both of them talk a lot.

869
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,222
As for...

870
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,619
Ms. Hangyeol, no idea.

871
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:25,001
Next,

872
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:27,044
Ms. Minwoo, no idea as well.

873
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,694
I don't know anything.

874
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:30,514
What?

875
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:32,463
Those are my guesses.

876
00:39:32,464 --> 00:39:34,295
(Riwon -&gt; Seoyeon &lt;- Heeyoung)

877
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:36,150
(Dagyo -&gt; &lt;- Mirang)

878
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:38,536
Should we tear this one out?

879
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:39,949
- I want to compare.
- Yes, yes.

880
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,170
- Tear it out.
- Yeah, okay.

881
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,348
But do we write down our choice too?

882
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:44,651
- But I... I...
- Yes.

883
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:45,921
Let's not include our choice.

884
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:48,588
Optional. That's optional.

885
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:52,563
What I know is Ms. Seoyeon chose me.

886
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,812
(Confused)

887
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,668
Because Seoyeon was focused on pushing me.

888
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,341
She misunderstood the rules.

889
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:01,729
Thought she'd get a date
with the person she'd picked today.

890
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,003
So she said to me,

891
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:06,189
"You're going on a date
with me today." Like this

892
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,414
- Oh, no.
- And I was like, "Oh?"

893
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:09,486
"Oh."

894
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,329
- That woman.
- That woman.

895
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,043
It was like that.

896
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,399
But at the time,

897
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,604
Ms. Mirang... You and Ms. Minwoo, right?

898
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:19,421
The result was a tie.

899
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:20,554
So,

900
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:22,918
it was like, "Let's compete another round."

901
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:26,532
- I'll start again.
- I thought she was just straightforward.

902
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,690
Well, that too, but this was... Yeah.

903
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:30,227
Anyway, suddenly...

904
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,424
So fun.

905
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:32,557
The tension subsided.

906
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,141
- So now I understand...
- Got it.

907
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:35,142
The situation.

908
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,004
Oh, and?

909
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:41,543
Jinah must have chosen Heeyoung.

910
00:40:43,297 --> 00:40:44,261
To summarize,

911
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:45,512
many people shared my thought.

912
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:47,248
Because I also talked to you.

913
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:50,070
That's what makes you look mature.

914
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:52,314
Because initially Ms. Heeyoung
and I went out together.

915
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:54,746
Even now I can't say.

916
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:56,101
But the situation of you two...

917
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:57,622
Because I listen to both sides.

918
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,888
Just listening, not
passing on what was said.

919
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,791
Because I can be overcommitted.

920
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,424
Honestly, I talked out my confusion.

921
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:04,786
That's why I can't guess.

922
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:06,698
I think today's grouping
doesn't make sense.

923
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,132
So the grouping

924
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,271
of Team Baby and Team
Oneself has no meaning.

925
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,287
I thought us staying
here would have meaning.

926
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:14,313
It doesn't.

927
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:15,629
Beep.

928
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:16,606
If so,

929
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,636
I ask, "Who here chose me?"

930
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:21,309
No. Who?

931
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,424
(Bitter)
No. Except Ms. Mirang.

932
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:24,599
(Dagyo's guesses get more twisted)
Not true.

933
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:26,064
(Dagyo's guesses get more twisted)
Mirang, talk to me.

934
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:27,793
Just a sec. Give me a sec.

935
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:30,491
Probably because it's all tangled up.

936
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:32,703
I've always thought this
place makes no sense.

937
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:34,124
Next?

938
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:36,443
I don't know about Ms. Minwoo.

939
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:37,571
Ms. Hangyeol...

940
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,503
Don't know about her either.

941
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:41,440
Because we rarely talk to them.

942
00:41:41,441 --> 00:41:43,034
Why do we rarely talk to them?

943
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:44,295
Who else?

944
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:45,992
The person next to you.

945
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:49,304
I'm so sorry.

946
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:51,829
(Invisible human)
Ms. Mirang said she was sure of it.

947
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,823
Choose.

948
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,428
Our date yesterday was very good.

949
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:55,895
- Hot, right.
- Good.

950
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,483
I think I'm right.

951
00:41:58,484 --> 00:41:59,736
(Dagyo's misguided guesses)

952
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:00,804
Ms. Mirang is clear.

953
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:01,864
So fun.

954
00:42:02,797 --> 00:42:05,058
First of all, Ms. Minwoo.

955
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:07,510
- I don't know about Ms. Minwoo.
- Probably Ms. Seoyeon.

956
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:11,295
- Because she went out with Ms. Hangyeol.
- Probably chose Ms. Seoyeon.

957
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:14,567
- She knows because they share a room.
- Next.

958
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:18,628
As for Ms. Seoyeon, I think...

959
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:19,830
she chose Ms. Dagyo.

960
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,646
Um, you could feel it. Next.

961
00:42:22,648 --> 00:42:25,173
Ms. Dagyo does look a little confused.

962
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:26,299
So let's do it like this.

963
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,455
I think, "I think I'm gonna
choose someone else."

964
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:34,126
But I also think, "Maybe Ms. Heeyoung."

965
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:36,121
Ms. Dagyo chose Ms. Heeyoung.

966
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:37,416
So fun.

967
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:39,161
Very funny.

968
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:41,608
It suddenly occurred to me.

969
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:43,923
Because... No. You can't have a reaction.

970
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:45,402
- Yeah, got it.
- So fun.

971
00:42:45,403 --> 00:42:47,628
I don't know about Ms. Heeyoung at all.

972
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:48,848
What about Riwon?

973
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,047
Probably Jinah and Hangyeol.

974
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:51,828
I don't think Jinah's chosen anyone yet.

975
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:53,734
That's neat.

976
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:56,582
Can I do this?

977
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,529
Inside ranting and raving.

978
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,389
Can I try?

979
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,486
Just between us.

980
00:43:01,937 --> 00:43:02,869
It's okay.

981
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,510
(Mirang's guesses are an ouroboros.)
One, two, three, four, five, six.

982
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:08,943
You're not leaving this out
for when they come back.

983
00:43:08,944 --> 00:43:10,141
I'll leave it out.

984
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:11,558
I want to rattle them.

985
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:12,770
Me too.

986
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:15,659
- Leave it out, right?
- I don't want to leave it out.

987
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,909
That's okay. Take yours out.

988
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,455
- This is enough.
- Take yours out.

989
00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:20,256
Take the ones you don't want to leave out.

990
00:43:20,637 --> 00:43:22,918
Because you'll be guessing too
when I'm not here.

991
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:24,510
You may have the courage to speak out.

992
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:25,993
- It's awkward.
- Mirang doesn't mind.

993
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:27,226
That I agree.

994
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,603
Oh, that's very profound.

995
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,749
Because it's just us here,

996
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,713
so I try to be straightforward.

997
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,585
- I really like that.
- Same.

998
00:43:37,586 --> 00:43:39,210
I love it.

999
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:44,380
I love doing something
like this. It's so fun.

1000
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:47,530
(So how will those coming back
from the date respond to this?)

1001
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:50,128
During that time, though it was very fun,

1002
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:51,812
but since I spent all day today

1003
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:54,443
thinking very hard about my own feelings,

1004
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:56,048
"So that's what I'm like,"

1005
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:59,569
it was the moment I thought,
"I guess I'm like this."

1006
00:43:59,606 --> 00:44:01,314
(Team Oneself returns to the houses.)

1007
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:03,010
All right, we're here.

1008
00:44:03,011 --> 00:44:05,849
- Thank you, everyone.
- You guys must be tired.

1009
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,817
I'm not tired at all today.

1010
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:09,782
- I had a blast today.
- Thank you very much.

1011
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,725
You're a great driver. Thank you.

1012
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:15,083
- And I'm very proud our team won.
- Yes.

1013
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:17,124
Let's try reincarnating with success.

1014
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,694
All right, let's go.

1015
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:20,215
Because we are winners.

1016
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,654
- You're going to House 2?
- Yeah.

1017
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,237
Where do we put the trash?

1018
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:31,939
- I left it in the car.
- Really?

1019
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,546
- Now I'm abnormal.
- No, throw it away.

1020
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:35,649
How could you leave it in the car?

1021
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,578
It's food.

1022
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:39,018
But it was fun, right?

1023
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:40,578
Me? Overall,

1024
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:45,496
today I was... uh...

1025
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:48,198
Don't drift. Come this way.

1026
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:51,334
I forgot the way.

1027
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:53,189
We're back!

1028
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,691
We're back!

1029
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:57,288
What the heck? Why is there no one here?

1030
00:44:58,253 --> 00:44:59,697
(Looking)

1031
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,137
What's this?

1032
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:06,340
- Why?
- What's this? Wait.

1033
00:45:07,112 --> 00:45:08,216
What's this?

1034
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:10,802
Are they guesses about who chose who?

1035
00:45:12,064 --> 00:45:14,357
- Why?
- Eh?

1036
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:16,275
Were they really guessing this stuff?

1037
00:45:16,276 --> 00:45:18,352
They...

1038
00:45:18,353 --> 00:45:20,925
- It's crazy.
- Are they crazy?

1039
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,468
Have they gone crazy?

1040
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:25,398
Are you kidding me?

1041
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:27,968
No, they're just random guesses.

1042
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,378
Who's the question mark?

1043
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:31,459
Ms. Seoyeon, Ms. Dagyo?

1044
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,620
I don't know who's the question mark
in the middle.

1045
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:36,592
I was exhausted and shocked.

1046
00:45:36,593 --> 00:45:37,855
Because she saw that notebook.

1047
00:45:37,856 --> 00:45:39,733
I said I liked Ms. Dagyo

1048
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,028
and someone guessed it correctly.

1049
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:45,019
I don't know about Ms. Heeyoung.

1050
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,116
You don't?

1051
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,017
The person who said
she didn't know was Ms. Jinah.

1052
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,925
But I don't know...

1053
00:45:55,122 --> 00:46:00,307
(Who's the focus of
Heeyoung's unpredictable heart?)

1054
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:02,467
But I thought...

1055
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,778
no one here was interested in me.

1056
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:06,098
You received a letter yesterday.

1057
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,831
- I never got them.
- Really?

1058
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:09,602
- Huh?
- Never got them.

1059
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,423
- Huh?!
- I never got them.

1060
00:46:11,424 --> 00:46:14,670
- I'm so shocked about this? Really?
- I'm shocked too.

1061
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,458
I thought she always gets the letters.

1062
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:19,818
I've never received the letters.

1063
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,222
But you've been going on dates with Jinah.

1064
00:46:22,223 --> 00:46:23,101
So now I...

1065
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:24,624
Because I show my feelings.

1066
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,615
I was thinking we got
to know each other now.

1067
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:28,594
I'm shocked about that.

1068
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:31,357
Because her words and
actions kept changing.

1069
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:33,567
So I was like, "What do you want me to do?"

1070
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:37,595
I thought you've been
receiving two letters at a time.

1071
00:46:37,596 --> 00:46:40,632
- Continuously.
- Me too.

1072
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:43,240
I was about to give up

1073
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,261
because no one was interested in me.

1074
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,739
That's not true.

1075
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,179
Not true.

1076
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:54,750
(Heeyoung expresses her confusion.)

1077
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:57,926
(Jinah & Dagyo are taking a walk,
not knowing Heeyoung has returned.)

1078
00:46:57,927 --> 00:46:58,946
I just...

1079
00:46:58,947 --> 00:47:01,234
Even if I change my mind,

1080
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,803
we don't have enough time
to get to know someone who's changed.

1081
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:05,441
- I see. Really?
- Don't you think so?

1082
00:47:05,443 --> 00:47:08,305
But I don't think I'll change my mind.

1083
00:47:08,306 --> 00:47:09,805
That gives me comfort.

1084
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:12,933
If I'm not in that situation,

1085
00:47:12,934 --> 00:47:15,724
even if the other person has changed,
I won't be shaken.

1086
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:18,764
Unless I find out something about her.

1087
00:47:18,765 --> 00:47:20,352
Is that called being unaffected?

1088
00:47:20,353 --> 00:47:23,844
The feeling of never experiencing it.

1089
00:47:23,845 --> 00:47:24,884
Right?

1090
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:28,055
The feeling of never experiencing it?

1091
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:28,920
Unwavering.

1092
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:30,904
- Unwavering.
- Unwavering?

1093
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:33,661
So it's difficult for me too.

1094
00:47:33,662 --> 00:47:35,353
It seems so,

1095
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:36,679
but also not.

1096
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,354
That's what I was worried about
when I decided today.

1097
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:41,896
Exactly.

1098
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:44,341
I think the chaos up until yesterday,

1099
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:45,699
when I sent a letter to someone,

1100
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,511
my feelings were clear.

1101
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:48,569
When you texted?

1102
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,053
- Today when I texted.
- Today?

1103
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:52,759
The feeling of not being able to

1104
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,099
write other women's name.

1105
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,439
- Yes.
- But up until yesterday,

1106
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,245
I felt a little apologetic.

1107
00:47:58,246 --> 00:48:00,690
I didn't even send her a letter, but

1108
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:02,911
today I don't feel apologetic.

1109
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:05,512
Up until yesterday, I was like,
"Don't you have feelings for me?"

1110
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:07,159
"You want to get to know other people?"

1111
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,394
That was my line of thought.

1112
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:09,568
That doesn't matter now.

1113
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:12,071
So I want more than being paired with her.

1114
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:13,439
Then you've almost made up your mind.

1115
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,582
Nothing to decide today.

1116
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,558
Exactly. That's it.

1117
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,839
"I'll keep showing my feelings for you."

1118
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,600
"You just do whatever you want."

1119
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:22,173
Because I didn't want sound rude,

1120
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:25,663
I tried to talk about that
as delicately as possible.

1121
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:29,929
(Heeyoung returns to House 1.)

1122
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:31,487
Oh?

1123
00:48:32,094 --> 00:48:33,626
I'm back!

1124
00:48:33,627 --> 00:48:35,419
Heeyoung.

1125
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,156
Sis.

1126
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:39,107
(Jinah gets up.)

1127
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:41,293
Eh? You return in that condition?

1128
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,360
No, I left my coat

1129
00:48:42,361 --> 00:48:43,823
at the other house.

1130
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:46,539
(Both walk past each other
without saying anything.)

1131
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,667
What did you guys do?

1132
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:51,050
- We made pottery.
- Really?

1133
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:52,652
You did something fun.

1134
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:53,765
I used to want to try.

1135
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:56,445
After my first attempt, it was like...

1136
00:48:56,446 --> 00:48:57,379
"A handcraft?"

1137
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,116
That's what I meant.

1138
00:49:00,591 --> 00:49:01,733
Asking non-stop.

1139
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,103
Because it was my first time,

1140
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:05,515
I thought it'd be very easy to make.

1141
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:08,184
But it was very hard
to keep it symmetrical.

1142
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:18,023
(Jinah sleeps far away from Heeyoung
without saying anything.)

1143
00:49:18,024 --> 00:49:22,210
(Will Heeyoung and Jinah be able
to resolve this misunderstanding?)

1144
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,623
What's that?

1145
00:49:29,624 --> 00:49:32,003
- I went to a convenience store.
- Really?

1146
00:49:32,004 --> 00:49:34,339
Oh, because of dinner?

1147
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,720
I got a request.

1148
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,092
ToGetHer really bought it.

1149
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:39,469
That's chicken breast.

1150
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,103
Looks like there's something.

1151
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,214
Rice crackers?

1152
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:45,203
Not rice crackers but something similar.

1153
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:48,586
Because I got to come back to Jeju Island,

1154
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:50,295
I need another glass of makgeolli.

1155
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:51,519
Can the rest of you drink alcohol?

1156
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,256
But this mandarin orange makgeolli

1157
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:54,913
can only be found on Jeju Island.

1158
00:49:54,914 --> 00:49:56,148
Looks delicious.

1159
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:57,212
I want to try.

1160
00:49:58,312 --> 00:50:00,060
Come here and let's take a group photo.

1161
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:01,868
- Oh, okay.
- Ms. Mirang, come on.

1162
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:04,531
Ms. Mirang has long arms.
She should hold the camera.

1163
00:50:04,532 --> 00:50:05,643
- Mirang, come on.
- Polaroid.

1164
00:50:05,644 --> 00:50:08,016
But I don't think we can adjust the angle.

1165
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:09,018
Don't move.

1166
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:12,069
All right, we're all here. Okay.

1167
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:14,061
One, two, three.

1168
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:19,292
(Memorizing the ToGetHer House in a photo)

1169
00:50:19,735 --> 00:50:21,335
Oh, why weren't you in the photo with us?

1170
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:22,220
Why are you missing?

1171
00:50:22,221 --> 00:50:26,072
I was there and I made a winking pose.

1172
00:50:27,814 --> 00:50:28,639
Oh, no.

1173
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,115
(Hangyeol made a winking post.)

1174
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:31,117
Where?

1175
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,123
I was over here.

1176
00:50:33,124 --> 00:50:34,101
Really?

1177
00:50:34,102 --> 00:50:35,742
Come, I'll take a solo photo of you.

1178
00:50:35,743 --> 00:50:37,553
A solo photo is a waste.

1179
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:38,590
Why is that?

1180
00:50:38,591 --> 00:50:39,902
Taking solo photos wastes film.

1181
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,319
How many are left?

1182
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,075
Right now? Four.

1183
00:50:43,077 --> 00:50:44,550
Can I sit over there?

1184
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:48,117
Wanna sit in front of the stone wall
to show this is Jeju Island?

1185
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,409
Not bad. One, two, three.

1186
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,905
You can sell that.

1187
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:07,937
I don't have to pay, right?

1188
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,378
Just like an idol.

1189
00:51:09,379 --> 00:51:10,501
(A marketable solo photo of Hangyeol)
Feels like

1190
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:12,662
(A marketable solo photo of Hangyeol)
an idol polaroid.

1191
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:18,109
(Mirang comes to House 1
after returning from a convenience store.)

1192
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,702
Do you mind?

1193
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,284
- Huh?
- What are you doing?

1194
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:27,347
Everyone's sleeping.

1195
00:51:27,348 --> 00:51:31,472
- Dinner will be at 7 pm.
- 7 pm?

1196
00:51:31,473 --> 00:51:33,607
What time is it now? One more hour.

1197
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,910
One hour?

1198
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:40,384
- Sis!
- Yes?

1199
00:51:40,386 --> 00:51:42,960
- What?
- Seriously.

1200
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:44,779
What?

1201
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:46,059
That sketchbook of chaos.

1202
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,232
They said your guesses
were the most random.

1203
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:49,699
- They said, "Are they crazy?"
- Why?

1204
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,883
Said they were just names.

1205
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:52,057
- Said to throw it away.
- Why?

1206
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:53,819
Yours is the worst.

1207
00:51:54,566 --> 00:51:56,139
Mine? Wait, Heeyoung.

1208
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,950
Who did Ms. Heeyoung choose?

1209
00:51:59,694 --> 00:52:01,688
What did you do?

1210
00:52:01,689 --> 00:52:04,340
We just talked.

1211
00:52:04,381 --> 00:52:09,341
(The two people who haven't talked)

1212
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:11,677
- I bought that one too.
- What?

1213
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:13,020
I bought a ToGetHer.

1214
00:52:13,025 --> 00:52:14,110
Huh? Really?

1215
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:15,651
But why did you go alone?

1216
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:18,668
Just to a convenience store
It's my turn to make dinner today.

1217
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:21,595
So we'll have ice cream, right?

1218
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,524
Yeah, you and me.

1219
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:25,377
Huh? What's this?

1220
00:52:25,378 --> 00:52:26,461
This one.

1221
00:52:26,462 --> 00:52:28,700
They say it helps with blood circulation.

1222
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:29,817
Oh, no.

1223
00:52:31,683 --> 00:52:33,417
I'm not bragging.

1224
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:36,056
I will enjoy this.

1225
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:39,128
I want to drink this every morning.

1226
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:41,555
My legs are swollen
today, so they're longer.

1227
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:43,228
(Crack... crack...)

1228
00:52:43,271 --> 00:52:45,220
- Thank you.
- I'll help.

1229
00:52:45,828 --> 00:52:47,399
Yeah, okay. I almost got it.

1230
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,554
I'll pretend to open it.

1231
00:52:50,555 --> 00:52:52,683
What did you do while I
was at the other house?

1232
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:53,604
Us?

1233
00:52:53,605 --> 00:52:56,904
Putting stuff away and wiping tables.

1234
00:52:56,905 --> 00:53:01,025
But Ms. Heeyoung...

1235
00:53:01,026 --> 00:53:02,579
said my guesses were random.

1236
00:53:03,156 --> 00:53:04,769
(Totally.)

1237
00:53:05,712 --> 00:53:07,426
Who did I say Ms. Heeyoung chose?

1238
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:09,000
Ms. Heeyoung?

1239
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,744
(Shaking head)

1240
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:16,118
(Jinah goes upstairs
while they're talking in the living room)

1241
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,573
(as if to look for a quiet place
to talk to Heeyoung.)

1242
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:22,995
(Looking left and right)

1243
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,428
Sis, but right now my throat's really sore.

1244
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:27,508
Really?

1245
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:29,398
You have a sore throat, Dagyo?

1246
00:53:29,399 --> 00:53:33,006
- Yeah.
- A little sore right now.

1247
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:33,857
Why's that?

1248
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:35,363
Is it because we were outside earlier?

1249
00:53:35,364 --> 00:53:36,490
There was a cold wind.

1250
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:39,018
Not because of all the yelling
during the go-karting?

1251
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:40,959
That makes sense. What?

1252
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,634
You were shouting too loud.

1253
00:53:45,149 --> 00:53:46,082
(Tapping)

1254
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,912
(Jinah calls Heeyoung to follow.)

1255
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:50,755
(Intrigued)

1256
00:53:50,756 --> 00:53:54,758
(Heeyoung follows Jinah.)

1257
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,752
Shall we go?

1258
00:53:57,753 --> 00:54:00,801
Shall we go to the other house?

1259
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:04,770
Can we talk? Do you have time to talk?

1260
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:06,398
Do you have time to talk?

1261
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:07,659
You don't wanna talk?

1262
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:13,221
You don't wanna talk?

1263
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:15,935
I want to talk to you about something.

1264
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,018
Why?

1265
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:20,487
You don't wanna talk?

1266
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,173
Well, just hear me out.

1267
00:54:24,755 --> 00:54:27,501
It's not something that serious.

1268
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,190
You won't wanna talk?

1269
00:54:31,191 --> 00:54:32,248
Can we talk?

1270
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:34,227
(Nodding)

1271
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:35,772
I was wondering

1272
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,369
if the way I left this morning

1273
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,210
put too much pressure on you.

1274
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:40,887
Sis,

1275
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:43,139
I thought I left because of your choice.

1276
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,453
Did you expect me to say this?

1277
00:54:45,455 --> 00:54:50,598
(Heeyoung doesn't answer.)

1278
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,819
(Smiling)

1279
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:59,325
I chose you.

1280
00:54:59,326 --> 00:55:00,745
It was me who chose you.

1281
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,983
I don't know what you're talking about.

1282
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:13,839
Today? Today?

1283
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,442
(Nodding)

1284
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,983
So I...

1285
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,428
What were you gonna say?

1286
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:22,384
If you're asking why

1287
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,485
I said what I said this morning,

1288
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:28,150
it was because I left for a date first.

1289
00:55:28,155 --> 00:55:30,139
It was because you thought

1290
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,136
I'd chosen someone else and left.

1291
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:34,542
So...

1292
00:55:36,848 --> 00:55:37,848
So...

1293
00:55:38,623 --> 00:55:41,952
I want to tell you that I chose you.

1294
00:55:41,953 --> 00:55:43,771
Are you crying because you feel guilty?

1295
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:46,069
Why are you crying?

1296
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:53,794
(Heeyoung's getting her some tissues.)

1297
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:55,056
Why are you crying?

1298
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:11,291
I'm crying because...

1299
00:56:12,591 --> 00:56:15,304
Huh? You want some water?

1300
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:19,143
It's okay. It's okay.

1301
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:22,321
It's okay.

1302
00:56:22,322 --> 00:56:24,908
Why are you crying?

1303
00:56:24,909 --> 00:56:29,212
Why are you crying?

1304
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,704
Because I've noticed more than I thought.

1305
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:48,487
So I... always...

1306
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,450
When I like someone,
I show my interest very clearly.

1307
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,097
But in that matter, I...

1308
00:56:53,098 --> 00:56:55,219
Now...

1309
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,458
I'll try to say it slowly.

1310
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:01,166
In everyday life, we can take our time.

1311
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,858
Because I'm like that.

1312
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:07,625
Here...

1313
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:09,297
I've been talking to you...

1314
00:57:09,298 --> 00:57:13,138
for only three days.

1315
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:17,637
Here, no matter...

1316
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:18,782
Why?

1317
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:20,360
Why are you crying?

1318
00:57:20,361 --> 00:57:21,399
I don't know.

1319
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,786
Here, no matter...

1320
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:27,004
how much I know this or that person,

1321
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:31,740
aside from you, I don't really
want to know anyone else.

1322
00:57:32,355 --> 00:57:35,673
But if I'd said that...

1323
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:39,653
Sometimes when we talk

1324
00:57:39,654 --> 00:57:42,691
while we eat, you say,

1325
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,749
"We can all get to know each other."

1326
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,732
I think we're too different.

1327
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:50,263
So...

1328
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:52,412
So I want you to know that

1329
00:57:52,413 --> 00:57:56,290
I want to go out with you.

1330
00:57:57,198 --> 00:57:59,647
But saying that...

1331
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:03,399
is embarrassing or hurts my pride.

1332
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,395
So...

1333
00:58:06,396 --> 00:58:10,501
So when you said,
"You chose someone else, didn't you?"

1334
00:58:10,502 --> 00:58:14,992
When you said that...

1335
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:17,230
Even when we were at the kart circuit,

1336
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:20,162
you didn't really look at me.

1337
00:58:21,906 --> 00:58:24,382
Sis...

1338
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,388
I think we respond differently

1339
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:28,495
to the language we use
to express ourselves.

1340
00:58:28,496 --> 00:58:33,510
I'm naturally very sensitive
to people expressing themselves.

1341
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:35,709
I really wanted to show it.

1342
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:40,199
I was afraid you'd feel pressured,

1343
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,839
so the words I wanted to say...

1344
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:48,303
I thought you

1345
00:58:48,304 --> 00:58:50,199
probably chose someone else.

1346
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,825
But even then, I didn't care.

1347
00:58:51,826 --> 00:58:55,199
Of course I was upset.

1348
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,861
Because I can't

1349
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,405
push you or force you to choose.

1350
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:03,752
But if I still have feelings for someone,

1351
00:59:03,753 --> 00:59:06,732
I can't befriend...

1352
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:10,448
that person and feel comfortable.

1353
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:13,243
I tend to...

1354
00:59:13,244 --> 00:59:15,970
Before you returned, I kept thinking

1355
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:19,988
I would like only Heeyoung.

1356
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,427
Saying I like you after only three days

1357
00:59:22,428 --> 00:59:26,270
may sound unbelievable or even funny.

1358
00:59:26,276 --> 00:59:28,437
I just want us to have
confidence in each other,

1359
00:59:28,438 --> 00:59:29,913
but that seems impossible.

1360
00:59:29,914 --> 00:59:31,456
I feel like I want more from you.

1361
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:33,441
That's why I'm so confused.

1362
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:37,531
I thought if we try going
on a date with someone else,

1363
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,984
"Will I be able to feel your confidence?"

1364
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:43,552
Today I texted.

1365
00:59:43,553 --> 00:59:46,553
But I could only write your name, so...

1366
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,617
Other people tend to say that to me.

1367
00:59:49,618 --> 00:59:52,610
Other people...

1368
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:53,869
Can't you read the room?

1369
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,635
I'm sorry.

1370
00:59:55,636 --> 00:59:57,460
Why are you crying?

1371
00:59:58,488 --> 01:00:03,211
I came to hang out.
I carefully chose my timing.

1372
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:05,268
My timing...

1373
01:00:05,279 --> 01:00:06,708
Wow, bad timing.

1374
01:00:06,722 --> 01:00:07,722
But...

1375
01:00:07,735 --> 01:00:08,794
Your first time in here.

1376
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:10,141
Because if not today,

1377
01:00:10,155 --> 01:00:12,646
I thought we wouldn't
have a chance to get close.

1378
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:15,515
- I want to start today.
- Come here.

1379
01:00:16,328 --> 01:00:17,928
I cried.

1380
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:19,306
What? Me? That's ridiculous.

1381
01:00:19,307 --> 01:00:22,864
I cried. No, no.

1382
01:00:22,865 --> 01:00:25,978
So you're that kind of person?

1383
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:27,761
I didn't cry.

1384
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:30,312
Why do I like women who make me cry?
Because they're very cool.

1385
01:00:30,313 --> 01:00:31,868
Not good, but cool.

1386
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:33,359
I didn't cry.

1387
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,679
Probably cried 3 times in your life.

1388
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,321
(Shocked)

1389
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:40,861
Actually, everything I say

1390
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:43,567
- I say it to ease the tension.
- Yes.

1391
01:00:44,105 --> 01:00:46,752
It's a clumsy way to express myself.

1392
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:49,147
I want you to understand my feelings.

1393
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:50,880
Even though I want you to leave.

1394
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:54,480
With Ms. Minwoo, I understand quickly that

1395
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:56,831
she doesn't do questionable things

1396
01:00:56,832 --> 01:00:59,318
without clear intentions.

1397
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:01,281
Generally, people will leave

1398
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,616
when two people are talking
and one of them is crying.

1399
01:01:03,623 --> 01:01:07,509
But Ms. Minwoo's behavior was unusual.

1400
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,428
That was her intention.

1401
01:01:09,429 --> 01:01:13,804
So first of all, I was like, "Okay."

1402
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:15,580
Ms. Minwoo came in,

1403
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:17,192
so Heeyoung was very relieved

1404
01:01:17,246 --> 01:01:19,620
and a little gentler with me

1405
01:01:19,621 --> 01:01:20,818
because Ms. Minwoo came in.

1406
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:22,826
So she was like,

1407
01:01:22,827 --> 01:01:24,706
"If she feels a little more relaxed,"

1408
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:27,253
"maybe we can talk more, right?"

1409
01:01:27,273 --> 01:01:28,872
I thought, "That's a relief."

1410
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:32,319
I went there because I had
a clear reason to hang out, so I went.

1411
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,479
But she was crying,
so I wanted to go in even more.

1412
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,858
I went in because I wanted to see

1413
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:42,129
how Ms. Heeyoung and Ms. Jinah
talked and handled each other.

1414
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:45,509
And to see if their relationship was ending

1415
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:47,626
or progressing. I wanted to assess that.

1416
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:52,190
I acted ignorant and went in
because I'd missed Ms. Heeyoung.

1417
01:01:53,982 --> 01:01:55,734
(Darkness visits the ToGetHer Houses.)

1418
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:58,393
I feel a little broken.

1419
01:01:58,404 --> 01:02:00,584
My tears won't stop coming.

1420
01:02:03,097 --> 01:02:04,676
What if I...

1421
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:07,143
say I want to go on a date with Ms. OO?

1422
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:08,511
What then?

1423
01:02:08,543 --> 01:02:10,710
(Confused)

1424
01:02:11,076 --> 01:02:14,526
Why won't you answer me at all?

1425
01:02:15,136 --> 01:02:16,658
Are you mad at me?

1426
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,148
Are you mad? Huh?

1427
01:02:18,206 --> 01:02:20,064
Do you understand?

1428
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:21,547
Oh. Huh.

1429
01:02:22,552 --> 01:02:23,751
We'll talk later.

1430
01:02:23,762 --> 01:02:24,826
Let's go.

1431
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:32,157
(Who are their hearts focusing on?)
