1
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,305
(Dagyo is waiting for her date.)

2
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:54,223
(Who will Dagyo go on a date with?)

3
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,960
(Grinning)

4
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,746
Oh.

5
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,112
- You changed your outfit.
- Hi.

6
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:10,401
- Hm?
- You changed your outfit.

7
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,071
- Yes.
- You'll freeze to death.

8
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,265
It's not cold at all.

9
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,980
- Is it just me?
- How is this not cold?

10
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,218
I'm still cold when I'm wearing this.

11
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,302
Maybe because you've been outside for a while.

12
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:22,092
I'm not cold. The weather is nice and sunny.

13
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:23,117
Mm.

14
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:25,490
Why did you change? You were pretty before.

15
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,741
- Because this looks better.
- Mm.

16
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,246
True. You really do look better.

17
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:32,392
That's a relief.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,684
So...

19
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,101
About that...

20
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,261
Just like I said,

21
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,404
I think so far we've always been roommates.

22
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,939
Friends. There were times...

23
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:47,899
we almost misunderstood each other,

24
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:50,061
but they weren't misunderstandings.

25
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,515
(Nodding)

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,547
Sometimes I act like,

27
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,550
"Don't give me hope" or something like that.

28
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,455
Really? When?

29
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:02,922
I tried not to show my feelings.

30
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:06,306
Well, you made eyes at me.

31
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:08,386
It looked like you did.

32
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,757
And when did you figure out?

33
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:14,477
When I talked to Jinah

34
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:19,183
and she told me about her relationship with you,

35
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,541
about how close you were.

36
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:25,406
The comfort between you two.

37
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,428
When I heard that.

38
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,649
Because the three of us were close
and we were roommates,

39
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,024
but I had never seen that side of you.

40
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,372
- Yes.
- Mm.

41
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:35,588
So I started to think,

42
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,401
"Oh, you've never done that with me."

43
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,703
"Maybe it was a joke."

44
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:44,312
But I was like, "No way."

45
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:47,115
You were probably confused if it was.

46
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,528
And I'm not...

47
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:53,342
someone who thinks that deeply.

48
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:55,700
But recently

49
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:58,373
when we talked and made eye contact...

50
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,902
Because of your smiling eyes.

51
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:05,119
Your smiling eyes were sending me signals.

52
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:08,131
But I didn't think much of it.
I just thought you liked smiling.

53
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:10,646
Because I thought you didn't know.

54
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,717
That's why

55
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:14,492
I didn't think those looks meant anything.

56
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:16,229
But I think sometimes you were aware

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,399
so you gave me those looks.

58
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,667
Got me really confused.

59
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:22,489
It was actually the latter.

60
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:23,871
So you're just smiley?

61
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:28,150
- Smiley by default.
- But...

62
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,424
because I feel comfortable around you

63
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,138
and it feels good, so I smile.

64
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,817
I don't smile like that for everyone.

65
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,938
- True.
- Mm.

66
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,959
You realized when you got my letter?

67
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:42,800
At the time...

68
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,485
right after I read it,

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,942
I knew without a doubt

70
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,142
that it was you.

71
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,895
It must be.

72
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,055
Yes, because I purposely wrote it
to let you know it was me.

73
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,191
No way you wouldn't know.

74
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,148
Because I wanted you to know it was me.

75
00:03:57,723 --> 00:04:00,712
For our remaining time here,

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,494
I want you

77
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:04,519
to pay me some attention.

78
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,474
That's why I wrote.

79
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,139
(Pondering)

80
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:15,567
- I feel like I'm gonna crying.
- Why's that?

81
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,689
What's wrong?

82
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,651
Are you okay?

83
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,772
Don't know.

84
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,195
Why am I like this?

85
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,140
- Why are you crying?
- Today is the saddest day.

86
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,006
- Why?
- Don't know.

87
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,303
It just is.

88
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:38,454
I don't want a lot of love.

89
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,185
It's not that at all.

90
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:41,813
How did you know?

91
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,616
(Dagyo showing her feelings indirectly)

92
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,446
Postponed?

93
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,085
No.

94
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,408
(Heeyoung not sensing that look at all)

95
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,531
Unnecessary.

96
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,481
What I regret is

97
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,704
(Sincerity sent when too late)
things turned out that way. - Yes.

98
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:02,215
When that happened,

99
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,403
we end up here.

100
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,641
(Dagyo not wanting to have regrets)

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,808
(Heeyoung becoming aware of Dagyo's feelings)

102
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,902
After this talk,

103
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:18,084
I understand how you feel.

104
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,425
It must have been very difficult for you.

105
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,095
It actually hasn't been that difficult.

106
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:26,992
Not that difficult.

107
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:29,190
But because both of you

108
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,923
are very important to me,

109
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,481
so all I could do was...

110
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,884
listen.

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,639
What worried me about writing that letter was

112
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,526
we had a great relationship.

113
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,709
Plus

114
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,635
we were good roommates too.

115
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,129
If I showed my interest,

116
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:51,769
I was afraid that you

117
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:55,417
would dislike me and keep your distance.

118
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,424
- You were worried about that?
- It got me

119
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,108
so worried about that.

120
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,454
I would never do that.

121
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,052
I thought you being a decisive person,

122
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,186
if you got my letter and didn't reciprocate,

123
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:10,790
I thought you wouldn't confuse me.

124
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,103
- If it was a no.
- You thought

125
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:15,726
- I would reject you.
- If it was a no, you would reject me.

126
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,463
I thought you were like that.

127
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:20,638
Before sending it,

128
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,713
I hesitated if I should send it.

129
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,760
- But we go on dates to know each other.
- Yes.

130
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,195
So I decided not to say

131
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,427
that I was interested in you

132
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,482
because I didn't want that.

133
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,940
I see.

134
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:37,089
If we leave without knowing each other.

135
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:39,991
Yes, I agree with you.

136
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:48,241
I was afraid if she found out I liked her,

137
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,472
she would keep her distance.

138
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,191
So I chose not to show my interest.

139
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:54,368
So our talk made me regret that.

140
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,314
It was our last day too, so everything was...

141
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,461
When I looked at the big picture...

142
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,589
(Frozen)

143
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,492
I thought I was okay, but I wasn't in the end.

144
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,016
(Sniffling)

145
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,847
That's why I cried.

146
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,739
Yes, I agree with you.

147
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:21,002
That must've taken

148
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:23,409
a lot of courage.

149
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,785
I was worried it'd be awkward between us.

150
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:30,794
I thought...

151
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:33,087
- I see.
- even if I wasn't reciprocated,

152
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:36,347
- Why would do think that?
- I'd still want spend time with you.

153
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,201
When I really thought about it,

154
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,990
it made me very worried

155
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,516
whether to write you.

156
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,490
I'm glad

157
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:50,748
that you did.

158
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,395
My heart trembled when I read it.

159
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:58,634
You're exactly my type.

160
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,542
- My written words?
- Yes, those words.

161
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,448
They were very obvious.

162
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,661
At the time it made me realize

163
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,532
that now

164
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,342
someone called Dagyo was interested in me.

165
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,285
I see.

166
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,107
(Heeyoung realizing she was that person)
And I realized the person you'd confided in me about

167
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,699
(Heeyoung realizing she was that person)
was actually me.

168
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,376
I want to try talking to you.

169
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,397
It's perfect that we have
this opportunity to go on a date.

170
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,302
- Yes.
- But that day,

171
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,867
what you said to me

172
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,699
made me realize

173
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,721
and deal with my own feelings,

174
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,896
that these were my feelings

175
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:41,507
and accept them.

176
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:45,322
And now you're doing well.

177
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:47,260
And the fact that I flirted with you...

178
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,354
Not flirting. Let's call it knowing myself.

179
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,025
That was the change.

180
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,737
Now I'm like someone who

181
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,641
suddenly saw the truth
after being blind for a long time.

182
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:01,804
And that day at the dining table,

183
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:03,609
we made eye contact.

184
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,235
So I started to feel something
and pay you more attention.

185
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,781
I'm confused too.

186
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:16,386
Even though I knew

187
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,984
you'd go on a date,

188
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:22,530
I still waited for you
to come talk to me afterward.

189
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:26,197
But you didn't come no matter how long I waited.

190
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:28,954
So I thought...

191
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:32,305
you were probably having a sleepover.

192
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,448
Yeah.

193
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,728
My mouth said I was okay,

194
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,549
but my heart felt bruised.

195
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,982
I kept thinking why I was like this.

196
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:47,304
Because today is the last day, so I have to

197
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:50,522
do everything to win.

198
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,757
(Showing)
So I'm wearing this top.

199
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,705
Because I thought you'd like it.

200
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,473
I look like that type.

201
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,377
Yes, I do like it.

202
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,402
I do.

203
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,072
I do.

204
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:10,317
This talk makes me feel

205
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,017
I want to know you better.

206
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:14,911
As a woman,

207
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:16,811
not as a roommate.

208
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,278
I didn't think you'd ask for a date with me today.

209
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:29,165
Because that day

210
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,848
when I decided to speak out

211
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,430
and accept the consequences.

212
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,222
That day they had us made love calls.

213
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,902
But you didn't call me,

214
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,775
so I thought...

215
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:45,083
that was how you felt.

216
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,785
- Like I said.
- I would think that too.

217
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,881
For you, if it's a no, it's a no.

218
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:51,253
I see.

219
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:53,520
So it made me...

220
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,102
I'm a slow processor.

221
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,177
Really, I'm a slow processor.

222
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,626
I've been updated to be faster.

223
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:03,656
And I don't know my own heart

224
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:04,816
until the last episode.

225
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,887
(Heeyoung slowly revealing her feelings)
I didn't think of the part where

226
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,775
(Heeyoung slowly revealing her feelings)
we won't see each other again.

227
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:13,383
Plus, for the first time there's someone
I want to go on a date with.

228
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,669
(Nodding)

229
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,795
So today...

230
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:25,108
I think we'll just get to know each other

231
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:30,189
and start like it's the first date.

232
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,924
That's what I think.

233
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,306
- Really?
- Mm.

234
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,826
(Her desire to know Dagyo even if it's too late)
So I wanted to have a chance

235
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:41,844
(Her desire to know Dagyo even if it's too late)
to get to know you better.

236
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,592
- I'm so confused.
- It's confusing.

237
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,003
But...

238
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,055
you do know

239
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,887
- I don't want to make this hard for you, right?
- It's not that.

240
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:59,841
- I know you're not like that.
- You get me, right?

241
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,029
I should be thanking you

242
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,675
for telling me how you actually feel.

243
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,197
You making things hard for me,

244
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:09,554
that's never gonna happen.

245
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,491
I won't worry too much.

246
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,394
I will follow my own feelings.

247
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,997
I hope you do the same.

248
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,272
Got it.

249
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:24,062
I will try...

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,401
to think carefully...

251
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:29,771
again.

252
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,045
I guess the time is up.

253
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:38,506
Things were getting good.

254
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,201
(Your one-on-one date is over.)

255
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,286
- Shall we get up?
- Mm.

256
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:45,986
Aren't you cold?

257
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:47,593
- It's hot now, right?
- It's hot now.

258
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,767
- Hot packs, right?
- Mm.

259
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:54,237
- Shall we?
- Mm.

260
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,767
You go ahead.

261
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,136
- See you.
- Mm.

262
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,368
(Heeyoung & Dagyo
Their one-on-one date is over.)

263
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,722
(Unsettled)

264
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,623
My only worry is

265
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:16,543
even though I'm trying my best,

266
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,706
it must be very hard on Dagyo.

267
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,400
Up to this point,

268
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,444
she has been taking things slow

269
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,896
and everything's perfect

270
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,529
and going well.

271
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:35,241
But suddenly I showed up at the end.

272
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,204
If I were Dagyo

273
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,204
and had to choose one of the two,

274
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:43,844
maybe not just one of the two,
but one of the three,

275
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,086
If I had to make that choice,
I'd feel very uncomfortable.

276
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:50,156
So I'm worried about that.

277
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:55,910
(Dagyo waiting for her next date)

278
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:59,587
(Mirang, Dagyo's third date)

279
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,811
What's that?

280
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,985
Oh, it's you.

281
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,144
Yes.

282
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:11,271
From far away, I thought
someone was bringing blankets.

283
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,020
What's this?

284
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,092
- I was wondering what they were bringing.
- Why are you crying?

285
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,572
Why are you crying?

286
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,141
Hm, it's just...

287
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,059
Just...

288
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:25,006
(Mirang worrying about Dagyo)

289
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,978
I was wondering who was bringing blankets.

290
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:28,203
- Why are you crying?
- Hm?

291
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,237
It's from the talk.

292
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:36,382
Did you have fun on the date?

293
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:38,162
Mm...

294
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:39,866
Well... Mm.

295
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:42,912
It bothers you, right?

296
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,644
(Nodding)

297
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:50,814
Are you worried?

298
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:55,480
I heard something from Heeyoung.

299
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:57,081
You heard something from Heeyoung?

300
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,639
Did you choose

301
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,119
- Heeyoung today?
- Today?

302
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
No.

303
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:09,766
(Confused)

304
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,375
I chose you.

305
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,785
I chose you immediately.

306
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,110
- Really?
- Mm.

307
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,922
(Confused)

308
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:26,972
I didn't tell Heeyoung who I'd chosen today.

309
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,249
Heeyoung told me that

310
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,608
she got to be with you for the first time.

311
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:36,891
She probably meant

312
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:39,345
I'd sent her letters before

313
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:43,463
and she chose me today.

314
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:47,068
From our conversation,

315
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:48,818
that's probably what she meant.

316
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,030
Because I haven't told anyone today,

317
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:53,943
aside from you, who I chose.

318
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,051
(Relieved)

319
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,104
I was crying my eyes out over there earlier.

320
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,586
You... No.

321
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,427
You were crying?

322
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:06,777
- Why?
- Because I was sure

323
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:08,455
I'd get a date with you, but instead...

324
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,226
So we were both crying.

325
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:16,537
But instead...

326
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:17,941
You got it wrong.

327
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,546
- Yesterday.
- Ah.

328
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,556
You made me a promise

329
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,735
- you wouldn't go out with Heeyoung.
- Mm.

330
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:31,027
Don't want me to go, right?

331
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,413
That would be ideal.

332
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:36,437
Okay.

333
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,581
(The promise they made with each other)

334
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,715
You thought I texted.

335
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,174
I didn't text. I just...

336
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,544
- Come on.
- I was heartbroken.

337
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,414
You must have been

338
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,204
while you were waiting.

339
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,421
Don't cry.

340
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:06,038
We take turns comforting each other.

341
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:07,928
Don't cry, don't cry.

342
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,953
It could be Heeyoung's plan

343
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,206
to confuse the hell out of you.

344
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:19,669
(Heartbroken)
Why did you think that?

345
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:21,326
I didn't say anything like that.

346
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,386
You saw today when I was alone with Heeyoung

347
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,378
in the living room.

348
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:28,091
What I talked to her at the time...

349
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,230
She came to tell me that

350
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:32,690
she'd texted me today.

351
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,378
Because we would go on a date,

352
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:37,319
she just came to let me know.

353
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,410
And I replied that I understood.

354
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,358
Because of that, right?

355
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:44,533
That's a relief.

356
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:48,356
Then why were you crying?

357
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:52,743
Today my mind feels...

358
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:55,881
very weak.

359
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,331
You're the same, right?

360
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,783
Everyone must feel like that now.

361
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,559
Feel better now that you understand?

362
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,254
(Nodding)

363
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,094
I made that promise.

364
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,316
Then why were you crying?

365
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:14,442
It's a secret why I was crying.

366
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,685
- But no more misunderstanding.
- Mm.

367
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,111
We were both crying.

368
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,954
I thought you...

369
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,436
liked Heeyoung enough

370
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,271
to break your promise with me.

371
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:30,591
That's what you thought?

372
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,839
You must've been confused waiting at home.

373
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,539
But it was just a misunderstanding.

374
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:41,061
I already made it clear.

375
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,086
If it's a no, it's a no.

376
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,441
(Dagyo making it clear)
I have a lot to think about

377
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,857
but today is the day

378
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,227
I feel the most comfortable.

379
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:56,408
I thought Dagyo had chosen Ms. Heeyoung,

380
00:18:56,433 --> 00:19:00,740
but she said with confidence
that she'd chosen me.

381
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:02,381
After hearing that...

382
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,962
I had been very worried on my own,

383
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,584
but after hearing that, I was relieved.

384
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:12,484
(Dagyo resolving Mirang's misunderstanding
and revealing her own feelings)

385
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,464
(Heeyoung waiting for Dagyo)

386
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:29,135
(The second person returning
from a one-on-one date)

387
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,909
(Exploring)

388
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,168
(Taking a glance)

389
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,654
No one's here.

390
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,679
Oh, there is.

391
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,153
- Why are you here?
- You're here?

392
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:46,025
Oh, I was admiring the view outside.

393
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,083
Well, excuse me...

394
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,187
So you're back.

395
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:51,933
Huh.

396
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:54,643
What's wrong?

397
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,109
- Hm?
- What's wrong?

398
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:02,216
What about me?

399
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,440
Why did you point at me?

400
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,681
- You're unbelievable.
- Huh?

401
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,228
What's that you said in that room?

402
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:16,081
What?

403
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:18,372
What I said in that room?

404
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,129
(Nodding)

405
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,253
What room?

406
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:24,270
What I said in that room?

407
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:27,434
Or did I misunderstand?

408
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:29,427
I told you the truth.

409
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,604
Like I told you.

410
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:35,364
Really? Ah.

411
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:38,960
I said I would choose Dagyo.

412
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,819
I thought you two were in contact.

413
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,901
Did you think we planned it?

414
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,644
You said you spent time together.

415
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:47,718
What do you mean?

416
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:50,041
Maybe I misunderstood.

417
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,515
When did I say that?

418
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,024
I just said I would choose her.

419
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:54,919
Get it together.

420
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:57,808
In the current situation,

421
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,809
we have no idea who she's gonna choose.

422
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,561
I just said I would choose her.

423
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:03,919
That's it.

424
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,303
That scenario is impossible anyway.

425
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,822
What are you even saying?

426
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:10,516
Get some sleep.

427
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,983
- That's why you misunderstood?
- What the heck?

428
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,223
- Yes.
- Even now?

429
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,724
I thought you two chose each other.

430
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:21,519
It wasn't like that.

431
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:23,833
I know the situation.

432
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:25,500
But so far that was

433
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:27,406
my first date with her.

434
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:29,976
It was our first.

435
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,389
Here.

436
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:32,764
You misunderstood.

437
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:33,957
Now I...

438
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,625
(Exhausted)

439
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,803
Seriously.

440
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,889
Or right now you're just...

441
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:40,806
- Very emotional.
- Probably.

442
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,624
Like made yourself fixated on the promise.

443
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:47,085
(Smiling bitterly)

444
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:50,101
I thought you chose Dagyo

445
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:51,949
and Dagyo chose you.

446
00:21:52,297 --> 00:21:54,277
Not at all. Dagyo didn't know

447
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:55,917
up until earlier.

448
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:57,839
I was probably lost it

449
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,774
so I misunderstood.

450
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,958
It was on me.

451
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,148
Because I didn't listen carefully.

452
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,968
That's why I got it wrong like that.

453
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,560
I see.

454
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:08,987
Huh.

455
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:13,632
Another secret, huh?

456
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,551
- It's so embarrassing.
- Why?

457
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:16,702
These things...

458
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:19,104
You misunderstood because you like her.

459
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,667
Would be impossible not to worry.

460
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,463
You got confused because of me.

461
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:27,292
Yes. That's true.

462
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,327
Oh, my head hurts.

463
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,066
(Talking to resolve the misunderstanding)

464
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:38,216
(Another location for a one-on-one date)

465
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:44,634
(Hangyeol waiting for her date)

466
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:51,624
Ow.

467
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,047
(Jinah asking for a date with Hangyeol)

468
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,651
Hello.

469
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,701
I was happy and afraid at the same time.

470
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:08,520
Happy because I saw the person I wanted to know

471
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:10,195
sitting and waiting for me.

472
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,055
It got my heart pounding.

473
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,256
As for my fear,

474
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:14,989
when I looked at Hangyeol's face,

475
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:17,799
she gave me a confused smiled.

476
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:19,352
The day before the date,

477
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:22,280
my feeling toward Hangyeol
who I'd been on a date with

478
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,929
has changed.

479
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,597
Should we talk comfortably?

480
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:31,445
We already promised, right?

481
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,984
- Will be a little difficult.
- Then we don't have to.

482
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,327
I'm the first one, right?

483
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:40,338
(Nodding)

484
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,530
Did you choose me? You don't have to tell me.

485
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:45,723
- It's a secret.
- Mm.

486
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,996
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

487
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:51,126
Thank you.

488
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:53,514
You ordered a meal?

489
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:00,871
(Breakfast ordered by Hangyeol)

490
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,880
Can I say something first?

491
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:04,047
Mm, sure.

492
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,698
Yesterday,

493
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:07,914
I...

494
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,235
was very worried

495
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,331
if our date would be fun.

496
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:13,418
But in a good way.

497
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,213
Why would you worry?

498
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,496
Because today will be our last date,

499
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:19,847
so I wanted to say everything.

500
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:22,027
I practiced my speech a lot before coming here.

501
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:23,691
(Haha)

502
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:26,893
We talked for the first time at the guest house.

503
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,631
When I like someone,

504
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:31,343
I like to feel adored by that person.

505
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,309
Sometimes I'm worried that person

506
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:35,328
won't look it that way.

507
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,475
There are people who like you.

508
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,901
Really?

509
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:41,704
There are people who I came to know

510
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,077
that became someone I don't know.

511
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,948
And now I know she doesn't like me.

512
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,542
Because of this, I'm worried about everything.

513
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,392
But it doesn't look attractive at all.

514
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,042
That's why

515
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,475
I don't care about age.

516
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,508
Just attraction.

517
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,932
I normally like older people.

518
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:03,731
I kept thinking,
"Am I attracted to someone younger?"

519
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:05,070
I kept thinking that.

520
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:06,808
So what would you call me?

521
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:09,914
But when we're outside the guest house,

522
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:12,624
I feel that this is better.

523
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,412
So...

524
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:17,609
when we're outside,

525
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,504
I think I want to try

526
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,917
talking to you, Jeong Hangyeol.

527
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:27,087
To show you my charms.

528
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:29,228
That's what I wanted to say.

529
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,688
It may seem...

530
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:33,603
a little cowardly, but...

531
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:36,346
I don't wanna be like that,
but because I'm insecure.

532
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,610
So I regret you saw that side of me.

533
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,120
Your demeanor worries me.

534
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,506
I keep wondering

535
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:49,765
if this is the real you.

536
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,429
Everyone here,

537
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,133
no matter who it is,
I don't want them to feel that way.

538
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:57,923
To feel left out
when aware of the other person's interest.

539
00:25:58,004 --> 00:25:59,965
So I try

540
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,108
to show that I'm impressed.

541
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,095
To let the other person know.

542
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,099
It's not me persuading them,

543
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:10,047
but it's me gathering courage

544
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:12,275
to show my feelings.

545
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,588
Because I think

546
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:17,117
doing that would benefit me more.

547
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:19,421
That's what I think.

548
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:22,035
When it comes to love,

549
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,675
we may think this person is the right one,

550
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:28,435
but after we know each other better,
it's no longer the case.

551
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,089
I think you need to know each other well enough.

552
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:35,099
I want to go back to the LP cafe.

553
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:36,946
Just one time.

554
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,366
I hope that we will get to
open up with each other again.

555
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,580
(Pondering)

556
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,264
For me...

557
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,292
if I get to...

558
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:50,602
be in person like this,

559
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,884
I would like to see that person's real self.

560
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:56,794
I think I'm really horrible...

561
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,838
at reading relationships or things like that.

562
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,393
I don't have that kind of sense at all.

563
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:07,021
Can I bring up something

564
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:10,653
- that's been bothering me since last night?
- Yes, go ahead.

565
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,703
After our date,

566
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:16,956
back at the guest house at night,

567
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:20,086
everyone kept saying this.

568
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,125
What did they say?

569
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,425
You're lying to me.

570
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:24,933
Huh? Why?

571
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:26,384
That's why

572
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,087
- I wanted to know
- Mm.

573
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:30,715
what that was actually about.

574
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:32,245
- Everyone kept...
- Why?

575
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,745
- saying that.
- Who said that?

576
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,213
Everyone who was there.

577
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,432
Because everyone said the same thing,

578
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,873
I couldn't help wondering.

579
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:44,401
Thank you for bringing it up.

580
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:46,119
I just wanted to be candid.

581
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:48,074
If I kept it in,

582
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,294
- it would bother me.
- Yes.

583
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,769
Everyone saying I'm being deceived,

584
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,474
what does that really mean?

585
00:27:56,513 --> 00:27:59,778
I wanted to ask because I'm curious too.

586
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:02,666
If it was just one person's misunderstanding,

587
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:05,704
I wouldn't have wanted to

588
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:08,302
throw oil on the fire.

589
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:11,896
Before trusting someone
or building a relationship with someone,

590
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:14,471
I think it's the right to do

591
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:16,379
to ask about these things.

592
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:19,108
After I returned from the date,

593
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,176
the only people I told about the date

594
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,943
were Minwoo and Dagyo.

595
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:26,288
I didn't tell anyone else except those two.

596
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,510
And I don't know what I lied about.

597
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,203
- You don't?
- Mm.

598
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,936
It might have been about

599
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,836
me dating only people with short hair?

600
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:41,720
- Mm...
- Was there any evidence?

601
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,648
What did they say?

602
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:45,476
I really want to know.

603
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:47,089
Dang it.

604
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:48,353
Actually...

605
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:51,510
it's been driving me crazy.

606
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,965
- You're confused, right?
- Because I have no idea

607
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:55,893
whose fault it was

608
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:57,941
or who was the one who changed,

609
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,807
so I feel uncomfortable.

610
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:02,298
I get it. I really do.

611
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:06,236
But even if I didn't actually do anything,

612
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,312
from now on,

613
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,460
I won't be able to say what I really think

614
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:11,226
because I don't know what I lied about.

615
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,719
But if what you're saying here

616
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,258
is what other people are saying,

617
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:18,463
then I want to ask the person who says that.

618
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,634
Because I can't explain the scenario...

619
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,496
that I'm...

620
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:27,113
deceiving you because I've...

621
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,447
never done something like that.

622
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,977
If I did something that
caused a misunderstanding

623
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:35,392
I could say, "Oh, probably because of that."

624
00:29:35,697 --> 00:29:38,880
I want to know too because
it makes me uncomfortable.

625
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:41,169
I could say, "It's not like that.
Maybe because of this word."

626
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,277
But now I don't know what to say.

627
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:47,485
I'm utterly speechless.

628
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,762
I never thought or do anything like that.

629
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,268
And I never lied.

630
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:54,577
I also never had bad thoughts.

631
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:55,604
So...

632
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:56,744
it's making me...

633
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,080
very tired.

634
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:04,754
The word "deceive" is too strong.

635
00:30:05,112 --> 00:30:07,752
After the date, I was...

636
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,408
worried as well. I was worried

637
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:13,507
what you would say about me.

638
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,621
I guess I was being
too non-confrontational again.

639
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:19,020
"Maybe I should avoid her."

640
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:21,507
There.

641
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,491
That's what I think.

642
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,056
But...

643
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,228
I don't want to do that.

644
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:34,610
So...

645
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:38,524
for me, whether inside or outside
the guest house,

646
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,779
I'm trying to not lose hope,

647
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:45,084
trying to not give up.

648
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:49,039
I don't like fighting
and the person who blames me

649
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:49,981
is me.

650
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,086
I'm not the type to hate someone.

651
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,617
Even outside, I've never...

652
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:58,115
(Sniffling)

653
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,149
I...

654
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:03,189
- I don't want you to be mad.
- I'm not mad.

655
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,737
I'm just tired of being hated.

656
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,497
That's why I want you here.

657
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,627
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

658
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,149
And that hope...

659
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,688
I don't want it to burden you.

660
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,532
So I...

661
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,618
focus on work.

662
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:20,842
- Right.
- Super focused on work.

663
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:23,388
I didn't bring my notebook.

664
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:25,549
That's why.

665
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,429
But...

666
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:30,977
I was so scared...

667
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:34,307
I couldn't speak.

668
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,699
But you were the one who brought it up.

669
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:43,168
That gave me such a relief.
I felt terrible myself because

670
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:44,775
I...

671
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,899
felt like I was alone.

672
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:51,022
I didn't see anyone at all.

673
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,721
Because I wanted to trust you

674
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,732
so I asked you about this. Actually,

675
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,034
if I asked,

676
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:00,696
you might not want to talk about it.

677
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,717
I was thinking that too.

678
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:06,085
Because those people
didn't know I would ask you.

679
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,580
There's one more thing

680
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,625
that I've been dying to ask you about.

681
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:12,919
You always wrote letters

682
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:16,248
to Heeyoung, but she

683
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:18,418
didn't write you at all.

684
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,054
It's the opposite.

685
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:22,393
Heeyoung wrote me letters.

686
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,816
I told Dagyo this too.

687
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,300
They had us write the name
of someone we wanted to know, so I

688
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,424
thought it excluded people
we'd already been out with,

689
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,114
So I didn't write Heeyoung's name.

690
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:32,642
- You never wrote Heeyoung?
- Just once.

691
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:35,990
May I ask why you didn't
write her again after that?

692
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,578
Actually, I talk about this
when we were together.

693
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,296
Two reasons.

694
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,975
One, I can't get to know two or more people

695
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,193
at the same time.

696
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:48,167
I don't want to like two people at the same time.

697
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:49,198
Heeyoung kept saying,

698
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,162
"Aren't we here to get to know each other?"

699
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,657
"I'm slow when it comes to feelings."

700
00:32:53,878 --> 00:32:56,484
"I don't fall in love easily."

701
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,306
When I was often told that,

702
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:01,689
I thought she must have felt uncomfortable.

703
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,186
And the second day, my misunderstanding.

704
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:08,628
When they had us write the name of
"someone you want to go on a date with today"

705
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:10,360
if you didn't get to today.

706
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:13,335
So I thought, "Among the people
I haven't gone on a date with,"

707
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,865
"who do I want?"

708
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:17,273
Plus I told Heeyoung I'd misunderstood.

709
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,819
Afterward,

710
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:21,666
the next day before the date at the kart circuit,

711
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,307
even though Heeyoung chose me

712
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:25,091
and I chose her,

713
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:27,050
I was the one who started.

714
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,290
I was the one who...

715
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:29,990
left first.

716
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:32,511
But she didn't look very happy,

717
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,181
so I said, "I went out and chose someone else."

718
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:37,414
"but I chose you."

719
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:39,094
That was the last time we talked.

720
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:41,448
She thought I was being sarcastic,

721
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:43,149
so she didn't want to talk to me again.

722
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,489
That was why.

723
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:48,092
So that means

724
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,505
when you said you'd sent her letters,

725
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:53,326
that person assumed

726
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,407
you were lying.

727
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,803
The fact that you told her you sent the text,

728
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:02,294
wasn't that like you choosing her?

729
00:34:02,664 --> 00:34:05,331
Yes, but I didn't send her a letter.

730
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:09,050
- I didn't send it. Why would I lie?
- I think you guys need to talk.

731
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:12,739
Because writing letters and sending texts
are the acts of choosing.

732
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,394
You two view the situation differently.

733
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,141
I think you two should...

734
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,578
clear that up.

735
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:21,835
Yes, but I'm...

736
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:24,436
too scared to do that.

737
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:25,363
But I'll try.

738
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,131
Buck up. There's only one day left.

739
00:34:27,163 --> 00:34:31,106
I think you should tell her that it wasn't a lie.

740
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:34,172
You thought I was lying, right?

741
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:37,882
Last night when I was listening,

742
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,029
I wasn't...

743
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:44,348
quite sure what to think.

744
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:47,647
- Anyone would be confused.
- So I thought,

745
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:49,618
"Was she lying?"

746
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,110
So for me,

747
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,890
you opening up

748
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:56,176
or giving me a chance...

749
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:57,841
- Might be a lie.
- might be a lie.

750
00:34:57,866 --> 00:35:00,852
- That really crossed my mind.
- It's okay.

751
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:03,396
We're here to get to know each other
and I want to focus on you,

752
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:05,403
but in my head, I kept thinking about that

753
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:06,736
- I see.
- If the two of us

754
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,639
get to go on a date together,

755
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,712
I'm actually not very good

756
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:13,786
- at focusing on certain things.
- Of course.

757
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,739
I think the two of you...

758
00:35:16,128 --> 00:35:18,617
Let's just say I get it now.

759
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,548
After all this, I think

760
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:23,321
today I have to...

761
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,213
be more focused.

762
00:35:28,053 --> 00:35:29,208
As myself.

763
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:31,247
I want you two to sort it out.

764
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:32,880
That's up to you now.

765
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,478
- Probably.
- Mm.

766
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,892
But anyway, today I

767
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,706
feel good to get to share my feelings

768
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,443
and make eye contact while talking like this.

769
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:46,721
I feel good.

770
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:50,161
Besides, you have your own problems.

771
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:53,242
I can't act like they don't exist.

772
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,883
That's true.

773
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,531
It's hard for me.

774
00:35:58,318 --> 00:35:59,318
Try...

775
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:04,287
Mm, I'll try...

776
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:09,206
Hangyeol was right about everything.

777
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,402
If something was bothering her, even secretly,

778
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:14,338
the date wouldn't have gone well.

779
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:17,697
For me, Hangyeol is like

780
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,528
another source of happiness

781
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:24,135
that has bloomed in this house of horror.

782
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,553
And I feel that this happiness

783
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:32,857
is suppressed by the pain from the past.

784
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,229
Do I really have to struggle this much

785
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:38,243
to figure out the answer?

786
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,176
As a result...

787
00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:43,167
I've learned many things.

788
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:45,992
It makes me think I should draw out my charms

789
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:48,881
and be confident in my own feelings.

790
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,389
It gives me a lot to consider.

791
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:53,738
Usually when I leave the guest house... Oh.

792
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:55,721
I guess our time is up.

793
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:58,382
(Time's up. Ms. Jeong Hangyeol,
please go to your next dating spot.)

794
00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:00,251
Bye-bye.

795
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,264
So...

796
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,923
I probably put you in a tight spot.

797
00:37:05,993 --> 00:37:08,717
Don't say things like that. For me,

798
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,407
the more I see you like this,
the harder it becomes for me.

799
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:17,866
- I want every woman in this world to be happy.
- Get there safe.

800
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:20,705
I'm glad we got to talk.

801
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,899
- I'm off.
- Bye-bye.

802
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:24,227
Bye.

803
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:36,563
(Hangyeol coming for her last date)

804
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:41,456
When the crew said it was the third time,
I thought no one else

805
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,363
had chosen me.

806
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,607
And I thought it was Dagyo

807
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:47,034
because I'd chosen her.

808
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,443
What's this?

809
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,218
Hello.

810
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:58,230
Hangyeol will be cold. Let me have that blanket.

811
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,057
Hello, hello.

812
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,335
I guessed there'd be 3 or 4 people,

813
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,568
but I didn't expect it to really happen.

814
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:15,310
It never imagined it'd be Hangyeol.

815
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,395
Because I'd been hearing

816
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,001
about her and Jinah.

817
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,798
I thought she would choose Jinah again.

818
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:25,728
Very unexpected.

819
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,173
I actually never thought of Hangyeol.

820
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,259
This makes me realize that Dagyo...

821
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:35,730
is hot, but...

822
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:37,169
because I trust Dagyo,

823
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:39,115
even if she talked to Hangyeol,

824
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,916
I think she'll still choose me no matter what.

825
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,362
So I'm not really worried.

826
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,997
Huh.

827
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:48,650
Did you have a fun date?

828
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,278
You've been on four dates today, right?

829
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:53,799
Why did you think that?

830
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:55,312
I know everything.

831
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:56,819
- Really?
- Yes.

832
00:38:58,118 --> 00:38:59,234
The others...

833
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:03,618
- You must be tired.
- No.

834
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,220
I'm not tired at all.

835
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,078
Just...

836
00:39:09,086 --> 00:39:11,726
Just had no idea it was you.

837
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,827
For me, right now

838
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,017
this is my last chance,

839
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:17,557
but I've never

840
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:20,384
- talked to you for real.
- Right, right.

841
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:22,820
So I wanted to try

842
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,913
talk to the person who...

843
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,159
my ideal type the most.

844
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:28,694
(I see)

845
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,304
- I see.
- Just wanted to give it a try,

846
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:31,545
so I chose to come.

847
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,163
The letter I've been curious about
that I didn't know who the sender was.

848
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:37,938
Yesterday they gave up time to check.

849
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:39,882
The letter I've been curious about,

850
00:39:39,907 --> 00:39:42,290
the sender is Hangyeol.

851
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:44,036
Oh, I figured...

852
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:46,407
you'd choose Heeyoung.

853
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:50,368
Something seemed to change between you two.

854
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,227
Oh, no. It hasn't.

855
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,023
Well, I...

856
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:57,703
have something I wanted to ask.

857
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,976
What's that?

858
00:39:59,993 --> 00:40:01,468
I also have

859
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,375
one suspicious letter.

860
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,930
Got it on the first day.

861
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,859
- You sent it, right?
- Yes, I did.

862
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:12,514
I wanted to know if you wrote that letter

863
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:15,422
because you didn't know who to write

864
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,109
or because that day I kept...

865
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,378
praising your beauty.

866
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:24,325
And because I like you,

867
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,439
I wanted to know if you writing it

868
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,571
was you reciprocating my feelings.

869
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:30,488
Did you write it

870
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,703
because it was the first day,

871
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:34,376
or because you

872
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,042
had feelings for me too?

873
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,419
I wanted to test the waters.

874
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:42,061
To be honest,

875
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,237
that day

876
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,502
after I got the first letter,

877
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,026
I thought it was you

878
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,521
because you said you liked me.

879
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:53,722
So...

880
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:55,573
I wrote to you that evening.

881
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:58,015
So that's why after that day

882
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,574
you didn't write me anymore.

883
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:04,114
- If I were...
- Mm.

884
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:07,781
a little older

885
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:10,058
or...

886
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:13,141
a little more good-looking...

887
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,756
It's not about those things at all.

888
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,234
At the time, you hadn't even told us your age.

889
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,861
And when you revealed your age,

890
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:23,020
- I didn't...
- You changed your mind, right?

891
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:24,375
I don't want you to think

892
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,342
those things have influenced me.

893
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:29,927
So, your identity...

894
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,830
I think it's attractive.

895
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:35,623
Now I'm here

896
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:38,814
talking about relationships

897
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:42,894
on the day that's too late.

898
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,694
But did you

899
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,448
write me many letters?

900
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:47,934
The first time.

901
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:51,112
At the time, aside from you,

902
00:41:51,406 --> 00:41:55,236
no one else was really my type.

903
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:58,203
At first, you and Mirang

904
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:01,000
were on a love thread.

905
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:03,144
So I thought you

906
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:04,725
probably liked older people

907
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,045
and people with short hair.

908
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,495
Something like that.

909
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,528
I figured you

910
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:14,705
wouldn't never be
interested in someone like me.

911
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,798
So after I wrote you twice,

912
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:21,454
I kind of gave up.

913
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,395
I actually don't care
about short hair or long hair.

914
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,646
When it comes to my type,

915
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:28,981
there are two people here who fit it.

916
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:31,913
- Heeyoung and Mirang, right?
- Yes.

917
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:34,898
So without considering

918
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,545
purely on external appearances,

919
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,266
where do I rank in the standing?

920
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:42,161
(Puzzled)

921
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:43,900
You, right?

922
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,178
Where do you rank?

923
00:42:46,485 --> 00:42:48,313
- Be honest.
- Honestly?

924
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,399
- Third.
- Really?

925
00:42:50,424 --> 00:42:51,424
Third.

926
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:52,609
Thank you.

927
00:42:53,513 --> 00:42:54,910
I'm being honest.

928
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:56,657
- I'm third?
- Yes.

929
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,300
Really.

930
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,914
I thought about writing you another letter.

931
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:04,201
- What would you write?
- I wanted to write,

932
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:09,154
"I want us to know each other better."

933
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:12,332
Because we haven't gotten to know each other.

934
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,245
If I...

935
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:18,819
had a bit more courage

936
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:21,485
and were more of your type.

937
00:43:21,985 --> 00:43:23,384
If I were to be reborn

938
00:43:23,713 --> 00:43:25,126
in my next life.

939
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:27,676
"I still want to know you even in my next life."

940
00:43:27,701 --> 00:43:28,701
Something like that.

941
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,414
I even wanted to write you
to make you write me back.

942
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,745
I'm really thankful

943
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,842
that you still like me.

944
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:41,215
Your feeling for me.

945
00:43:42,513 --> 00:43:43,787
I'm genuinely thankful.

946
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:45,929
I think you're attractive.

947
00:43:46,346 --> 00:43:48,656
You look mature.

948
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:51,590
I get the persona you want to have.

949
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:53,177
I think it...

950
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:54,658
really suits you.

951
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,230
But why don't you look confident at all?

952
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:58,801
I want to give you support,

953
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,557
want you to be confident in yourself.

954
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:04,226
This style of maturity really suits you.

955
00:44:04,413 --> 00:44:05,687
When I realized

956
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:08,510
I had zero chance

957
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:11,371
to show you my charming side,

958
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:12,913
it made me feel like

959
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,793
a complete fool.

960
00:44:14,998 --> 00:44:17,414
- Because I feel that way too.
- Don't think like that.

961
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:18,732
- Really?
- Mm.

962
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:20,492
So I'm...

963
00:44:20,993 --> 00:44:24,495
not here to ask you

964
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,998
to reconsider me.

965
00:44:27,023 --> 00:44:30,545
What I'm curious about is

966
00:44:30,604 --> 00:44:33,879
are you gonna write me as your final choice?

967
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,724
Will you still do that?

968
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:39,194
I don't know how long
I have to think about this stuff.

969
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,231
Actually,

970
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,621
I keep thinking about

971
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:46,024
your smiles all the time.

972
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,953
That's how I feel.

973
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,801
If we had to

974
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:52,985
leave without ever trying to talk once,

975
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:55,210
it would've been my big regret.

976
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,934
I just wanted your attention.

977
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,262
So...

978
00:44:58,287 --> 00:44:59,654
I'm really

979
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,853
- thankful that you told me.
- The situation now...

980
00:45:01,878 --> 00:45:04,599
Please don't let it burden you.

981
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:07,542
- I understand.
- Just think of me as a fan.

982
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:10,001
- You're not.
- I just want to

983
00:45:10,026 --> 00:45:11,986
remember you like this.

984
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:14,623
Actually at first,

985
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:17,117
I was very worried.

986
00:45:17,142 --> 00:45:18,568
Everyone was.

987
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:21,776
Before coming on the show, we were worried

988
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:23,955
that what would happen if no one liked us.

989
00:45:24,032 --> 00:45:26,811
You were the first one to approach me.

990
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:29,572
Sent me a letter.

991
00:45:29,597 --> 00:45:31,342
Plus, you liked me.

992
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,557
I really want to say I'm very thankful.

993
00:45:33,582 --> 00:45:36,529
When I was not confident,

994
00:45:36,554 --> 00:45:39,858
you were there to say that I was beautiful.

995
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:42,734
You keep encouraging me.

996
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:43,967
It made me

997
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,889
feel a lot more encouraged.

998
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,557
Because you empowered me.

999
00:45:48,806 --> 00:45:50,456
Those things that you did.

1000
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:52,409
- Thank you very much.
- I...

1001
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:56,717
had no idea you wrote me a letter.

1002
00:45:57,372 --> 00:45:59,421
Realizing that...

1003
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:02,196
That's why you wanted to know if I was the sender.

1004
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,162
I feel really good.

1005
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:07,776
Honestly, at this point

1006
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:10,216
I can't really do anything.

1007
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,908
Because we both know.

1008
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:16,994
I don't know how you two will end up,

1009
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:18,595
but I'm confident that

1010
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,158
you already know who you're gonna choose.

1011
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:25,562
I wish you happiness with that person.

1012
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:27,854
I want you

1013
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:31,201
continue to be honest with your feelings

1014
00:46:31,346 --> 00:46:32,256
to the very end.

1015
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:34,579
I hope everyone does that.

1016
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:36,739
Your final choice...

1017
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:39,475
is that person, right?

1018
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,739
About that...

1019
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,189
- I can't tell you.
- Understood.

1020
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:48,342
Maybe I'll be here again.

1021
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,880
Because I want to meet someone like you.

1022
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,222
Why's that?

1023
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:59,323
I think you're pretty hot yourself,
but why do you like me?

1024
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:01,604
It's really unexpected.

1025
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,443
As soon as I saw you,

1026
00:47:05,393 --> 00:47:07,372
you were the only one who made me

1027
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,140
feel that this kind of person

1028
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:13,608
would be able to make me fall in love,

1029
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:14,860
but

1030
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:17,488
"someone cool will definitely"

1031
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:19,615
"come and stir her heart."

1032
00:47:19,653 --> 00:47:21,625
Sometimes I think like that.

1033
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,587
But I'm glad

1034
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:25,407
we have this opportunity

1035
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:27,192
to talk.

1036
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:31,294
I myself didn't come here

1037
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:32,648
to hide my feelings

1038
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:34,642
because that would be disrespecting myself.

1039
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:38,301
I believe "even if that feeling is small,"

1040
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:40,848
I should still say it.

1041
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:44,577
But she must be tired from going on many dates.

1042
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:50,100
So I don't want her
to feel pressured by my feeling.

1043
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:52,580
I think in the future

1044
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:55,932
if I'm faced with difficulties,

1045
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,173
I would definitely think of today.

1046
00:47:58,198 --> 00:48:00,592
These people who hadn't been brave enough

1047
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:03,249
to show their true feelings

1048
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:06,887
but chose to ask me on a date at the last moment.

1049
00:48:07,607 --> 00:48:10,070
It's empowering for me.

1050
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,243
In the future,

1051
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:13,567
I'll definitely think about this.

1052
00:48:14,513 --> 00:48:15,770
Thank you.

1053
00:48:16,118 --> 00:48:19,374
I figured you knew

1054
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:21,997
that you would be the leading lady.

1055
00:48:22,586 --> 00:48:23,997
Oh, gee.

1056
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,551
I don't think that.

1057
00:48:27,576 --> 00:48:29,137
But it's turned out that way.

1058
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,243
Now for me,

1059
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:31,870
in that respect...

1060
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:36,700
I'm just another one out of many.

1061
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,816
- What many...
- Just one of the backups.

1062
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,280
I just want to remember it that way.

1063
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:47,746
Someone who decided to show her feelings

1064
00:48:47,973 --> 00:48:50,520
and someone who wasn't chosen.

1065
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:52,851
It makes me feel more comfortable.

1066
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,730
Because I like you.

1067
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,745
If I were you, I would do the same.

1068
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,877
I'd probably do what you did.

1069
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,577
It's gotten to this point.

1070
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,506
To leave without knowing

1071
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,378
would have been my big regret too.

1072
00:49:05,772 --> 00:49:07,626
Because I understand you.

1073
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,880
That's it.

1074
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:22,875
(Your one-on-one date is over.
Both of you, please return to the guest house.)

1075
00:49:23,912 --> 00:49:26,257
I guess it's finally over.

1076
00:49:27,273 --> 00:49:28,280
Thank you.

1077
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,590
Thank you.

1078
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:44,477
(Hangyeol gathered courage to confess
because she doesn't want to have regrets.)

1079
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,620
- Mirang!
- Oh.

1080
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,723
Who is it?

1081
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,227
Someone's here to yell at you.

1082
00:49:52,313 --> 00:49:53,356
Can I come in?

1083
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:54,417
Who is it?

1084
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:56,891
- You scared me.
- Who's that?

1085
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,156
- Heeyoung.
- Oh, it's Heeyoung.

1086
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,298
I'm not that brave a person,

1087
00:50:02,759 --> 00:50:04,118
but I went in because

1088
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,037
they slept in the same room.

1089
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:07,796
Even though I was confused as well,

1090
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:10,576
I wanted to know how they communicated

1091
00:50:10,787 --> 00:50:12,476
in a situation like this.

1092
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,549
How they felt.

1093
00:50:14,574 --> 00:50:16,663
I just wanted to know how they felt.

1094
00:50:16,856 --> 00:50:20,083
So I went in and lied down
between their mattresses.

1095
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,147
I didn't really say anything

1096
00:50:23,172 --> 00:50:24,821
because I didn't want to worry them.

1097
00:50:30,576 --> 00:50:33,108
(Mirang who suddenly got up and left)
I'll be right back.

1098
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,227
Where she is going?

1099
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,241
Don't know.

1100
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,108
I excused myself

1101
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:41,190
because Dagyo looked very tired today.

1102
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:43,473
If I was there,
she would've felt uncomfortable.

1103
00:50:43,484 --> 00:50:45,859
They wouldn't have been able
to say what they wanted to.

1104
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:48,845
It's not that I gave in to Heeyoung,

1105
00:50:48,856 --> 00:50:51,827
but I left because
I didn't want to tire Dagyo further.

1106
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:54,532
Did you decide who you'd write today?

1107
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:57,694
(Flinching)

1108
00:50:57,987 --> 00:50:59,282
What are you talking about?

1109
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:02,928
(Acting cute)

1110
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:05,027
Now you're acting cute.

1111
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:08,020
Am I not cute?

1112
00:51:09,546 --> 00:51:10,623
You are.

1113
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:12,730
Then I'll stop.

1114
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:14,601
You're really cute.

1115
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,060
Great job.

1116
00:51:18,523 --> 00:51:22,078
(Spending their last night with roommates)
Thank you for coming.

1117
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,725
(Seoyeon who remains alone)

1118
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:30,482
There's still time today to send a letter,

1119
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:33,337
so I've been pondering if I should write Dagyo

1120
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:35,538
or I should write someone else.

1121
00:51:39,703 --> 00:51:42,070
(Time to send your last letter.
Please go to the heart room.)

1122
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:46,453
(After learning each other's feelings
at their one-on-one dates,)

1123
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:49,159
(who will they write?)

1124
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:04,521
(What you want to tell that person today.
The letter that will reveal your feelings.)

1125
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:05,913
Aha.

1126
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,108
I knew it would be like this.

1127
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,998
(Writing a letter requires as much
thinking as making a phone call does.)

1128
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:29,503
(The moment of heartfelt confession)

1129
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:31,495
Mm...

1130
00:52:32,606 --> 00:52:34,408
I was taken aback,

1131
00:52:34,433 --> 00:52:36,251
but I was also glad

1132
00:52:36,276 --> 00:52:38,945
because I got to write someone new.

1133
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,682
And that person would be confused

1134
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:44,508
if I'm really interested in her.

1135
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,583
That thought makes it feel fun

1136
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:50,676
and makes me feel excited.

1137
00:52:51,562 --> 00:52:53,288
I wasn't worried at all

1138
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:57,075
because I already had someone I wanted to write.

1139
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,818
My only thought was,

1140
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,679
"Now I get to write you a letter."

1141
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,652
When I found out this would be a signed letter,

1142
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:06,873
I thought it would be very fun

1143
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:08,727
because I could never hide how I feel

1144
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,197
whether or not I sign my letters.

1145
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:12,941
But when I saw my name on it,

1146
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:15,757
I hoped her heart would be stirred in return.

1147
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,353
For me, every time I write a letter,

1148
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:22,421
whether I have to sign it or leave it unsigned,

1149
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,331
I always write with purpose.

1150
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:29,129
Whether or not that person knows who I am,

1151
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,523
it doesn't matter to me.

1152
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:34,511
(The letter being written
after much consideration)

1153
00:53:40,485 --> 00:53:43,905
(Dagyo still unable to write down that name)

1154
00:53:45,148 --> 00:53:49,108
(Hangyeol writing faster than before)

1155
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,453
(The love letter that will reveal it's me)

1156
00:53:52,905 --> 00:53:56,412
(Will any of them have a change of heart?)

1157
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:58,271
It's been a while...

1158
00:54:00,813 --> 00:54:03,306
(The letters have arrived.
Please check your mailbox.)

1159
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:04,567
Oh, the letters have arrived.

1160
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:06,144
In our bedrooms?

1161
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:07,770
- Really?
- What the heck.

1162
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:12,482
(Checking for letters on their final night
is more exciting than any nights.)

1163
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:18,188
(Heeyoung looking for a place to read alone)

1164
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:23,701
(Shaking the box)

1165
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,179
Ugh.

1166
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,429
(Stressed)

1167
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:34,092
(The love letter sent to Heeyoung)

1168
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:37,993
(The girl who sent Heeyoung the letter)

1169
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:40,437
"To Heeyoung,"

1170
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,302
"You're very beautiful today."

1171
00:54:47,068 --> 00:54:49,328
(And...)

1172
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,247
(Another message sent to Heeyoung)

1173
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:55,505
At the end of the letter,

1174
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,196
I drew Heeyoung's moon shoulder tattoo

1175
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,416
combined with mine.

1176
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,953
I overheard that Ms. Heeyoung

1177
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:03,196
enjoy things that happen in dramas.

1178
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,987
Both the drawing and the tattoos.

1179
00:55:06,279 --> 00:55:08,219
What I've shown her.

1180
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,796
I hope she can feel it.

1181
00:55:11,623 --> 00:55:13,836
(Smiling)

1182
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:18,337
(Heart stirring)

1183
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,525
It feels very good.

1184
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,898
And I'm thankful.

1185
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:25,073
I knew Dagyo would never write me.

1186
00:55:25,246 --> 00:55:27,320
When I didn't expect anything,

1187
00:55:27,345 --> 00:55:29,209
there was a letter from Minwoo.

1188
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:31,480
It makes me feel very thankful to her.

1189
00:55:31,505 --> 00:55:34,586
We're still not on the same page

1190
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:37,081
about many things,

1191
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:40,124
but she still always shows me

1192
00:55:40,149 --> 00:55:42,940
her feelings candidly.

1193
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:47,309
It makes me feel that
she doesn't want me to burden me.

1194
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:49,312
Makes me realize she still likes me

1195
00:55:50,272 --> 00:55:53,434
and is showing me her sincerity.

1196
00:55:54,939 --> 00:55:56,119
It makes me feel so good

1197
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,101
that my heart trembles.

1198
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,775
It's very heartwarming.

1199
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,225
(What about Minwoo who wrote Heeyoung?)

1200
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:08,436
(Shaking the box)

1201
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:19,410
(Minwoo's empty mailbox)

1202
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:22,324
(Hopeless)

1203
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,043
I'm not sad

1204
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,677
because I think I've done my best.

1205
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:35,478
But I just don't want to give up.

1206
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,227
So far I've always done my best

1207
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,054
and I will do my best until the very end.

1208
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:45,792
(What about Jinah who went
on a date with Hangyeol today?)

1209
00:56:47,877 --> 00:56:48,877
(Kim Jinah)

1210
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:50,533
Dang it. Unbelievable.

1211
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:51,684
It's the first time.

1212
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:58,281
(Jinah's empty mailbox)

1213
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:00,083
(Disappointed)

1214
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,801
(Thumbs up)

1215
00:57:03,826 --> 00:57:05,110
Why?

1216
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,346
(Kim Seoyeon)

1217
00:57:15,051 --> 00:57:17,177
(Stressed)

1218
00:57:24,088 --> 00:57:26,655
(Seoyeon's empty mailbox)

1219
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:35,413
(Sad)

1220
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:45,309
(Seoyeon realizing she's failed
in building a relationship)

1221
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:50,470
(Feeling even more frustrating)

1222
00:57:51,496 --> 00:57:55,380
(Mirang and Dagyo who used to
receive letters from Seoyeon)

1223
00:57:57,652 --> 00:57:58,730
You had to turn away?

1224
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:01,879
(Embarrassed)

1225
00:58:01,904 --> 00:58:03,724
- I'm gonna go read downstairs.
- Mm.

1226
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:09,015
(Dagyo excusing herself to the first floor)

1227
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:17,436
(Two love letters sent to Mirang)

1228
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:23,074
"To Mirang,"

1229
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,875
"Today's date was very fun."

1230
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,105
"It really bothers me that you cried."

1231
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:29,506
"Thank you for always showing me how you feel."

1232
00:58:29,534 --> 00:58:30,534
"From Dagyo."

1233
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:33,237
Dagyo wrote me a letter.

1234
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:37,023
She could have written someone else,

1235
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,115
but she chose to write me.

1236
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,433
So I'm very grateful to her.

1237
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,540
"To Mirang,"

1238
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:49,534
"I'm so glad to have been able
to share a room with you."

1239
00:58:49,718 --> 00:58:52,784
"From now on, I want to write you every day."

1240
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:54,131
"I like it."

1241
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:56,685
"Hehehe. From Seoyeon."

1242
00:58:57,699 --> 00:59:00,236
I know that

1243
00:59:00,335 --> 00:59:02,888
this feeling I have is one-sided.

1244
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:04,594
But even then,

1245
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,342
I can't keep being a secret admirer.

1246
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:09,279
No matter what, I have to give it a try.

1247
00:59:09,448 --> 00:59:11,754
So I decided to write her a letter.

1248
00:59:18,748 --> 00:59:22,181
(Confusion caused by an unexpected letter)

1249
00:59:31,181 --> 00:59:34,760
(Four love letters sent to Dagyo)

1250
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:41,749
"To my lovely Dagyo,"

1251
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,610
"Strong love often
requires growth and trials."

1252
00:59:45,739 --> 00:59:48,882
"While these trials are revealing
love that's strong and grows,"

1253
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:52,810
"you will need emotional support."

1254
00:59:52,835 --> 00:59:55,589
"Even though I can't find anyone"

1255
00:59:55,614 --> 00:59:58,388
"to join my journey at the ToGetHer houses,"

1256
00:59:58,413 --> 01:00:00,081
"this lovely Kim Jinah"

1257
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:02,907
"wish you love that's strong and clear."

1258
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,487
"I believe that will definitely happen."

1259
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:12,354
"Thank you very much
for being my first lesbian friend."

1260
01:00:12,868 --> 01:00:13,868
"From Jinah."

1261
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,064
"Today I just want to say
that you're very beautiful."

1262
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:24,004
"If there really is a next life."

1263
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:27,352
(P.S. I want to know you better.
To Dagyo, from Hangyeol.)

1264
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:32,411
(Dagyo feeling unsettled again)

1265
01:00:38,212 --> 01:00:40,115
"To Dagyo,"

1266
01:00:40,392 --> 01:00:42,992
"I don't want to think that this is too late,"

1267
01:00:43,017 --> 01:00:46,147
"but I'm glad we got to talk
before everything ends."

1268
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:49,387
"Thank you so much for making me
feel something nice like this."

1269
01:00:49,587 --> 01:00:53,334
"In the future, I still hope
to get to know you better."

1270
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:55,335
"Sweet dreams."

1271
01:00:55,604 --> 01:00:56,604
"From Heeyoung."

1272
01:00:57,739 --> 01:00:59,505
So far, I still think

1273
01:00:59,516 --> 01:01:01,675
the person who impresses me the most is Dagyo.

1274
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,635
She approached me and gave me courage.

1275
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,636
I think Dagyo is such a good person

1276
01:01:07,661 --> 01:01:09,395
that she moves me.

1277
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:11,901
I think the only person who can make me

1278
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,411
feel this way is Dagyo.

1279
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:21,534
(Tears that keep flowing)

1280
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:28,520
"To Dagyo, why do you worry so much?"

1281
01:01:28,545 --> 01:01:30,925
"Don't worry. You've done nothing wrong."

1282
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,822
"You're just highly sought-after."

1283
01:01:32,987 --> 01:01:35,307
"Today I pretended not to care"

1284
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:36,985
"because I didn't want to worry you."

1285
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,962
"It's unfortunate we didn't
get to go on a date together."

1286
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,608
"Today is the last day,
so manage your feelings well."

1287
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:43,716
"Don't worry too much."

1288
01:01:44,026 --> 01:01:46,251
"Thank you for making my memorable places"

1289
01:01:46,276 --> 01:01:48,649
"and fun stories filled with someone."

1290
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,267
"I like you. Mirang."

1291
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:55,901
Dagyo is actually a very cheerful person,

1292
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,038
but after being highly sought-after,

1293
01:01:58,063 --> 01:02:01,007
she probably feels guilty toward her suitors.

1294
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:02,652
Even if I don't know how it feels.

1295
01:02:02,836 --> 01:02:06,739
But this is not how Dagyo usually is.

1296
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,091
After seeing that,

1297
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:10,474
if I fuss over her,

1298
01:02:10,499 --> 01:02:11,627
she'll feel worse.

1299
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:13,937
So I decided not to say anything today.

1300
01:02:14,685 --> 01:02:17,119
I just thought I wanted to ease her mind.

1301
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,491
(The feelings only made known to Dagyo)

1302
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:53,000
(Many feelings overwhelming Dagyo all at once)

1303
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,663
You must be tired.

1304
01:03:00,674 --> 01:03:02,108
(Mirang approaching Dagyo)

1305
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:03,119
I am.

1306
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:07,613
Sleep. Don't cry.

1307
01:03:11,973 --> 01:03:12,973
Cover your head.

1308
01:03:19,724 --> 01:03:25,870
(Mirang consoling Dagyo who's crying)

1309
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:35,351
Why are you crying?

1310
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:36,617
Hm?

1311
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:38,899
Today is so tiring.

1312
01:03:39,552 --> 01:03:40,554
You're tired?

1313
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:42,180
I'm very tired today.

1314
01:03:42,474 --> 01:03:43,474
You're tired?

1315
01:03:45,366 --> 01:03:47,496
Why are you crying?

1316
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,030
- Are you confused?
- No.

1317
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:54,584
It's not that.

1318
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:57,092
- So why?
- I'm just so tired.

1319
01:03:58,299 --> 01:03:59,624
Today I...

1320
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,766
talked to many people.

1321
01:04:03,626 --> 01:04:05,009
It was tiring.

1322
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:06,034
Those feelings.

1323
01:04:07,366 --> 01:04:08,684
Those feelings.

1324
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,272
They came in all at once.

1325
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:16,272
Feeling guilty toward Heeyoung?

1326
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:18,487
No.

1327
01:04:21,012 --> 01:04:22,417
Try telling the truth.

1328
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:24,583
- About what?
- You feel guilty toward Heeyoung.

1329
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:26,901
No.

1330
01:04:27,306 --> 01:04:29,115
I'm crying because I'm tired.

1331
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:31,195
Plus, this is the last day.

1332
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:36,194
(Mirang pondering the reason Dagyo is crying)

1333
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:37,891
I'm not happy at all.

1334
01:04:38,905 --> 01:04:40,617
- Why not?
- Because you're crying.

1335
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,334
You're not confused, right?

1336
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:49,051
When I realized I wasn't the reason she cried,

1337
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:51,017
I got kind of upset.

1338
01:04:51,526 --> 01:04:53,178
Her crying that hard

1339
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:55,384
shows that mentally

1340
01:04:55,704 --> 01:04:57,599
she's very confused.

1341
01:04:58,066 --> 01:04:59,933
It makes the letter I wrote

1342
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:02,900
seem like a nonfactor.

1343
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:06,001
If she feels guilty,

1344
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:09,257
then she must like Heeyoung to some degree.

1345
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,798
Because of the bad timing.

1346
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:14,490
Uh...

1347
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:17,248
It makes me feel a little sad.

1348
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:22,392
It's not just about
the feeling of loving someone.

1349
01:05:23,226 --> 01:05:25,481
There are also times

1350
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:26,968
we've all spent together here.

1351
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,287
I find these things are very important.

1352
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:31,704
That's why I cried.

1353
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:36,854
Because I cried,

1354
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:40,421
she wasn't happy.

1355
01:05:40,432 --> 01:05:42,396
Hearing that made me even more tired.

1356
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:46,902
I really don't know...

1357
01:05:49,698 --> 01:05:50,761
what to do.

1358
01:05:50,841 --> 01:05:51,841
Maybe I...

1359
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:55,382
confused her again.

1360
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:58,539
Dagyo.

1361
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:04,987
Can I talk to you?

1362
01:06:05,485 --> 01:06:08,485
(Dagyo going to Jinah feeling confused)
What's wrong? Come here.

1363
01:06:16,259 --> 01:06:19,505
She probably went to Jinah for some advice.

1364
01:06:20,258 --> 01:06:23,059
If she actually cried because of me,

1365
01:06:23,999 --> 01:06:25,423
she would have stayed with me

1366
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,509
and talked to sort it out.

1367
01:06:27,991 --> 01:06:29,751
If it wasn't me

1368
01:06:30,772 --> 01:06:33,858
and it was someone else that made her cry,

1369
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,939
she wouldn't be able to tell me much.

1370
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:43,622
(Mirang assuming
Dagyo is worried about Heeyoung)

1371
01:06:44,086 --> 01:06:45,959
That's why she went to someone else.

1372
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:52,355
(Mirang still suspecting
Dagyo didn't cry because of her)

1373
01:07:08,826 --> 01:07:10,491
- What are you doing, Riwon?
- What?

1374
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:11,562
Mirang?

1375
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,636
Ugh, what should I do?

1376
01:07:14,826 --> 01:07:15,972
Did you get a letter?

1377
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:17,816
You didn't?

1378
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:18,841
I did.

1379
01:07:18,866 --> 01:07:20,350
So there's nothing to worry about. What?

1380
01:07:20,361 --> 01:07:21,486
But she cried.

1381
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,060
Why?

1382
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,636
Probably because of the letter from Heeyoung.

1383
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,342
She was crying.

1384
01:07:31,065 --> 01:07:33,229
I can't really take this.

1385
01:07:42,233 --> 01:07:43,612
For me,

1386
01:07:43,637 --> 01:07:46,554
I'm just moved

1387
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:48,872
and thankful for them.

1388
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:52,081
- You're upset, right?
- Mm.

1389
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:55,787
I didn't want to cry.

1390
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:01,917
And did you make it clear...

1391
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:03,964
that you weren't confused?

1392
01:08:03,975 --> 01:08:05,397
I told her not to worry.

1393
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:06,817
Mm.

1394
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,405
So go talk to her today.

1395
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,280
But I don't know

1396
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,380
what she's thinking.

1397
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,100
(ToGetHer)

1398
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:20,835
(The final night is full of misunderstandings)

1399
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,122
I didn't cry because I was confused.

1400
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:29,088
- Forget it.
- Really.

1401
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,106
- I don't want you to be upset.
- You don't have to say anything.

1402
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,229
- I don't want you to be upset.
- I'm not upset.

1403
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:54,715
- Did you talk to Jinah?
- Mm.

1404
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,113
- Go talk some more.
- Why?

1405
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,801
I'll come back later.

1406
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:01,300
No.

1407
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,460
No?

1408
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:09,529
Did you know I've been waiting for you all day?

1409
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,891
But here you were, crying in front of me.

1410
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,063
I'm sorry for crying.

1411
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:19,135
Sorry for crying. Please forgive me.

1412
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,160
Blame it on my age.

1413
01:09:27,988 --> 01:09:29,612
I won't play with you anymore.

1414
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:32,896
Don't be like that.

1415
01:09:35,593 --> 01:09:39,467
She got a letter from me today.

1416
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:42,664
And she didn't cry because of me.

1417
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:45,821
I think she was crying

1418
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:48,249
because of Heeyoung's letter.

1419
01:09:48,826 --> 01:09:51,396
She really confuses me,

1420
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:52,563
so I...

1421
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,849
don't really like...

1422
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:57,965
people who confuse me.

1423
01:09:58,643 --> 01:10:00,516
I'm not gonna choose her.

1424
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:06,248
(Mirang viewing the reason
for Dagyo's crying differently)

1425
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:10,938
Unbelievable.

1426
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:15,752
(Unrequited feelings,
Dagyo's heavy heart)

1427
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:18,133
Damn it, what the hell is going on?

1428
01:10:18,733 --> 01:10:20,000
Why are you crying again?

1429
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:22,685
Why? What's wrong?

1430
01:10:24,612 --> 01:10:26,975
She finds me annoying now.

1431
01:10:30,315 --> 01:10:31,391
It's so infuriating.

1432
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,591
I'm so infuriating.

1433
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,690
Even though I have feelings for her,

1434
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:41,984
I still keep making her feel bad.

1435
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,621
It's really infuriating

1436
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,394
that I can't control anything.

1437
01:10:47,646 --> 01:10:49,320
Because you understand

1438
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:52,205
how these people feel.

1439
01:10:53,713 --> 01:10:55,846
You've talk to them for seven days.

1440
01:10:55,871 --> 01:10:58,444
- Seoyeon, Heeyoung and others.
- Mm.

1441
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,932
Are the letters they sent you

1442
01:11:01,017 --> 01:11:03,011
too trivial? They're not.

1443
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:07,066
If you really felt that way,

1444
01:11:07,133 --> 01:11:09,398
you wouldn't have been here talking to me.

1445
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,362
It's not a feeling of love.

1446
01:11:12,387 --> 01:11:15,021
I'm just thankful for their feelings.

1447
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,640
The content in those letters
put me in a really tight spot

1448
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,583
when I read them.

1449
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:22,737
Mm.

1450
01:11:24,478 --> 01:11:26,981
I just felt moved, so I cried.

1451
01:11:27,006 --> 01:11:28,030
- That's all.
- Then...

1452
01:11:29,478 --> 01:11:30,491
this isn't on Mirang.

1453
01:11:30,516 --> 01:11:32,684
But it's on you to do something.

1454
01:11:33,312 --> 01:11:34,588
Because it's about your heart.

1455
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,339
I think you should try...

1456
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,374
to regroup.

1457
01:11:42,113 --> 01:11:44,843
Today has been really long.

1458
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:48,031
When will it end?

1459
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:52,638
I will choose...

1460
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,622
by following my heart.

1461
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,408
What am I supposed to do?

1462
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:01,911
This is why you're crying.

1463
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:04,018
Because you're being you.

1464
01:12:05,111 --> 01:12:06,788
So far there's only you

1465
01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:08,992
who can be with Mirang. Because it's you.

1466
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:17,520
I have to go down and ask something.

1467
01:12:19,297 --> 01:12:22,663
(Hangyeol going down
to see Heeyoung on the first floor)

1468
01:12:24,713 --> 01:12:25,817
Ms. Heeyoung.

1469
01:12:26,005 --> 01:12:28,295
- May I ask something?
- What?

1470
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,337
Did you get a letter from Ms. Jinah?

1471
01:12:30,362 --> 01:12:31,807
Today? No.

1472
01:12:32,007 --> 01:12:33,207
Why would I?

1473
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:34,992
She said she'd write you.

1474
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,017
Me?

1475
01:12:36,726 --> 01:12:38,327
- Write me?
- Got it.

1476
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,649
What are you talking about?

1477
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,988
Why would she write me?

1478
01:12:44,013 --> 01:12:45,050
She wanted to explain,

1479
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,278
clear things up.

1480
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:47,729
Huh?

1481
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:52,442
It may seem a little intrusive, but it's true.

1482
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:55,224
(Baffled)

1483
01:12:55,249 --> 01:12:57,831
- Wait.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

1484
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,906
- Even though I don't know...
- That's right.

1485
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:02,198
anything.

1486
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,543
- Got it.
- I really don't.

1487
01:13:03,568 --> 01:13:04,568
I'm sorry.

1488
01:13:06,073 --> 01:13:07,646
No. Unbelievable.

1489
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,176
You must understand

1490
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:11,963
if I didn't bring it up,

1491
01:13:11,977 --> 01:13:14,179
I wouldn't have anything else to say.

1492
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:16,532
I understand. I get it.

1493
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:20,262
Okay, it's okay.

1494
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:22,153
I saw the two of you...

1495
01:13:22,178 --> 01:13:23,205
It's okay.

1496
01:13:23,212 --> 01:13:24,754
But next time,

1497
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:25,900
don't do that again.

1498
01:13:25,911 --> 01:13:27,746
- But there's only one night left.
- No, no.

1499
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,811
That matter was over.

1500
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:31,615
It was?

1501
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,609
I thought it wasn't.

1502
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,435
It was over a while back

1503
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:36,924
and there's nothing else.

1504
01:13:37,339 --> 01:13:39,245
So why is this

1505
01:13:39,612 --> 01:13:41,178
happening now? What should I do?

1506
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,106
So I'll pretend I don't know anything.

1507
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,002
Then why did you bring me up?

1508
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:48,252
Because I didn't want to misunderstand.

1509
01:13:48,277 --> 01:13:49,905
Can I be honest?

1510
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:50,930
About what?

1511
01:13:51,476 --> 01:13:53,462
I asked her why she did that.

1512
01:13:53,473 --> 01:13:54,473
Why...

1513
01:13:55,373 --> 01:13:58,589
she chose you
when she hadn't written you a letter.

1514
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,337
Because I didn't know the situation.

1515
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,939
I feel like I'm going crazy.

1516
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,897
Did she ask you to say this?

1517
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:08,237
Say the thing I didn't say.

1518
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:09,890
Say what? Huh?

1519
01:14:10,452 --> 01:14:11,246
Just...

1520
01:14:11,812 --> 01:14:12,812
Ugh.

1521
01:14:14,226 --> 01:14:16,450
Because I didn't know about your relationship.

1522
01:14:16,475 --> 01:14:18,083
Then why did you do it anyway?

1523
01:14:18,108 --> 01:14:19,922
The situation at the time,

1524
01:14:19,947 --> 01:14:22,589
- I didn't...
- And other matters too.

1525
01:14:22,614 --> 01:14:24,210
requested that date,

1526
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:26,483
so I didn't have anything to say.

1527
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:27,594
Okay, okay.

1528
01:14:27,619 --> 01:14:28,822
- I didn't want...
- No.

1529
01:14:28,847 --> 01:14:31,289
If I deserve a scolding, please scold me

1530
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,735
about what I did wrong.

1531
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,560
Because I'm scolding myself

1532
01:14:35,585 --> 01:14:39,357
for interfering with that stuff.

1533
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:41,479
If I did wrong, please scold me.

1534
01:14:41,927 --> 01:14:43,067
What am I supposed to say?

1535
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:45,193
You probably wanted to mediate.

1536
01:14:45,218 --> 01:14:48,020
I didn't really try to mediate.

1537
01:14:48,045 --> 01:14:49,684
We just had nothing to talk about.

1538
01:14:49,738 --> 01:14:51,505
So you sold me out.

1539
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:55,172
It wasn't like that at all.

1540
01:14:55,653 --> 01:14:58,182
- But you already did. Did you hear?
- About what?

1541
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:00,946
She was telling me

1542
01:15:00,971 --> 01:15:02,625
to clear things up with Jinah.

1543
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,080
- It's not like that.
- What?

1544
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,099
Ms. Hangyeol.

1545
01:15:05,245 --> 01:15:06,867
Before this thing...

1546
01:15:06,887 --> 01:15:08,714
She told me to write Jinah an apology letter.

1547
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:09,993
develops,

1548
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:12,373
I thought it's better to resolve that first.

1549
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,234
What develops? There was nothing
between us in the first place.

1550
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,972
I told her that

1551
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:20,407
before starting anything new,

1552
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,972
if there's unfinished business,

1553
01:15:22,997 --> 01:15:25,327
that should be resolved first.

1554
01:15:25,878 --> 01:15:27,544
- I get it.
- Right now.

1555
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:28,739
Heeyoung...

1556
01:15:29,599 --> 01:15:32,097
- doesn't want anything to happen.
- Yes.

1557
01:15:32,122 --> 01:15:33,292
She wants it to end there.

1558
01:15:33,317 --> 01:15:35,086
That's why I'm trying my best.

1559
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,290
So far...

1560
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:38,604
I haven't told anyone anything.

1561
01:15:39,488 --> 01:15:42,603
They came to me and told me what they'd heard.

1562
01:15:42,628 --> 01:15:43,772
Then I explained it.

1563
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,330
But the reason you didn't know anything

1564
01:15:47,355 --> 01:15:49,024
is because what you heard isn't true,

1565
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:50,679
so I didn't say anything.

1566
01:15:50,972 --> 01:15:52,692
I didn't mean to curse anyone in secret.

1567
01:15:52,717 --> 01:15:55,339
- I didn't think you did that.
- Right.

1568
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:58,660
But you don't think
what you're doing now is wrong.

1569
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:02,334
That's why I didn't say anything.

1570
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,481
You kept pushing me to tell her
what we'd talked about.

1571
01:16:05,506 --> 01:16:07,084
I said we'd talked about this and that.

1572
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:09,079
Now this happens.

1573
01:16:09,104 --> 01:16:10,779
It was my fault for speaking too harshly.

1574
01:16:10,804 --> 01:16:12,483
- No, it was me...
- It was my fault.

1575
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,342
Because of what I said.

1576
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:18,396
I get it now, so you can leave.

1577
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:24,197
Sorry... for making...

1578
01:16:24,353 --> 01:16:26,343
- things messy.
- No, it was my fault.

1579
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:27,623
I was careless.

1580
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:32,305
I wanted to know what I'd done wrong too.

1581
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:34,887
I know you didn't mean it.

1582
01:16:34,912 --> 01:16:36,833
But I think you go and rest for now.

1583
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,320
You didn't know either.

1584
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,352
I'm really sorry.

1585
01:16:41,779 --> 01:16:43,131
Because today I...

1586
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:45,530
I don't know.

1587
01:16:48,218 --> 01:16:50,585
It was just a date.

1588
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,606
Why would I bring up that stuff?

1589
01:17:04,192 --> 01:17:06,722
I'm really dumb and clueless.

1590
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,116
So stupid.

1591
01:17:10,107 --> 01:17:11,986
(Hangyeol looking back at her own wrongdoing)

1592
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:14,359
What the hell is going on?

1593
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:16,768
Especially on the final night.

1594
01:17:17,746 --> 01:17:19,242
Why is this happening?

1595
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,108
- Unexpected trouble.
- Well.

1596
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:23,434
I planned to not say anything.

1597
01:17:26,187 --> 01:17:27,715
It's on me. It's my fault.

1598
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:35,386
(Stressed)

1599
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,618
I did my best.

1600
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,437
I didn't do anything.

1601
01:17:48,986 --> 01:17:54,219
(ToGetHer Houses
full of feelings on the final night)

1602
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:02,134
(Hangyeol still blaming herself
even late into the night)

1603
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:14,814
Is Jinah feeling hurt?

1604
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:18,488
She looks scared more than anything else.

1605
01:18:18,513 --> 01:18:20,759
- Jinah?
- Mm.

1606
01:18:21,227 --> 01:18:23,620
The fact that I talked about Ms. Heeyoung

1607
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:25,419
and Ms. Jinah like that,

1608
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:27,396
I think that

1609
01:18:27,862 --> 01:18:30,698
doing that is extremely inappropriate.

1610
01:18:30,723 --> 01:18:32,097
I keep thinking about

1611
01:18:32,706 --> 01:18:35,185
how to make amends for that.

1612
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,293
But no matter what,

1613
01:18:36,818 --> 01:18:40,742
those feelings are still there.

1614
01:18:42,225 --> 01:18:45,058
(Hangyeol feeling guilty)

1615
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:48,763
There's trouble because of me again,

1616
01:18:48,788 --> 01:18:50,069
so on the final night

1617
01:18:50,094 --> 01:18:51,707
I was very confused.

1618
01:19:00,433 --> 01:19:01,661
Ugh.

1619
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,556
I really want...

1620
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:12,756
to get out of here.

1621
01:19:19,151 --> 01:19:26,572
(The ToGetHer Houses full of confusion
about the final selection)

1622
01:19:27,604 --> 01:19:30,264
(The final day in the ToGetHer Houses)

1623
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:32,437
Seoyeon, I never got a chance to say...

1624
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:36,398
I'm jealous that
you who can do it without regret.

1625
01:19:37,126 --> 01:19:38,761
You got that right.

1626
01:19:39,688 --> 01:19:42,423
(The final love letter to convey your feelings)

1627
01:19:43,586 --> 01:19:44,586
(Pausing)

1628
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,592
I may help you to feel less tired.

1629
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:49,350
I wanted to try writing the word "like" once.

1630
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,780
My hand wouldn't move.

1631
01:19:52,186 --> 01:19:54,699
(Where will the letters be sent to?)

1632
01:19:55,096 --> 01:19:56,581
I want to know who will come

1633
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:57,591
and I'm excited.

1634
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,798
I wasn't worried at all.

1635
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:01,693
I'm not choosing anyone.

1636
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:03,734
Because I want to apologize.

1637
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:06,303
This is just the beginning.

1638
01:20:06,433 --> 01:20:08,686
(Where will their hearts land?)
I want you to be happy.
