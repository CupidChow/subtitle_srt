1
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,456
(ToGetHer House,
after Minwoo and Hangyeol left)

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,932
Isn't it ours? Is it for one person?

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,003
What is this?

4
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:41,863
- Maybe date privileges.
- What's this?

5
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:44,348
A one-on-one date with the person
who chooses the same card.

6
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,238
Today we can go outside.

7
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:50,254
The day of one-on-one dates.

8
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:53,503
- Three sets of cards.
- If you have a preference.

9
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,610
- Go ahead.
- Can I choose first?

10
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:57,658
- No.
- Of course not.

11
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,357
- No.
- What then?

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,781
Let's do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

13
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:01,875
Let's do it.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,008
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

15
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:05,531
(Dagyo, Mirang)

16
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:07,375
Us two. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,860
Shoot.

18
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:11,106
(Dagyo will choose first.)

19
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:13,180
(Mirang will choose second.)

20
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:14,365
What the heck?

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,523
Regardless you have to fight each other.

22
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:17,969
Wait, what's the result?

23
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,360
(The order to choose the cards)
One, two, three,

24
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:21,602
four, five, six.

25
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:22,938
Dang it.

26
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:24,696
(Thinking hard)

27
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:26,414
Oh, me, right?

28
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,955
(Which painting Dagyo will choose?)

29
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:32,048
I choose this one.

30
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,304
I choose this one.

31
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,624
(Butterflies and flowers)

32
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:40,067
What? Isn't this how we're supposed to do?

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,559
Actually we're not choosing the painting.

34
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:44,590
We're choosing the person
to go on a date with.

35
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:45,651
Hurry. Let's go.

36
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:46,683
That's right.

37
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,560
(Seoyeon who confessed to Mirang)
I wanna go out with Ms. Dagyo.

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,732
That's right. That's right.

39
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:53,833
Ms. Dagyo?

40
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,786
(Mirang is next. What will she choose?)

41
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,245
(Thinking hard)
Let's go.

42
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,318
- Yeah.
- Why are you thinking so hard?

43
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:05,395
So I took this one.

44
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,804
Oh!

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,367
I'll take this one.

46
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,460
Oh!

47
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,335
That's good.

48
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,938
In that moment, my mind went blank.

49
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:22,487
I was just speechless.

50
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:25,271
I felt...

51
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,255
betrayed.

52
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,451
You could say that.

53
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,868
But honestly,
love is fighting for what you want.

54
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:36,875
So I didn't really care.

55
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,264
I choose this one.

56
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,388
(Seoyeon chooses The Starry Night.)

57
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:46,662
I was in shocked that
I don't remember what I chose.

58
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,802
(Sneaking a glance)

59
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:54,123
(Heeyoung chooses The Gleaners.)

60
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,164
What?

61
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,068
Well, I can't see the paintings very well.

62
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,396
- Huh?
- I don't know.

63
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,734
The first time, we didn't really
get to know each other very well.

64
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,524
Whether it's a yes or a no,

65
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:12,050
I'd like to know her as well as possible.

66
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,081
It wasn't enough in terms
of knowing someone.

67
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,079
(Jinah wants to know Heeyoung better.)

68
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,297
(Confusion sets in
due to unexpected decisions.)

69
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,038
Dang it.

70
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,780
Hey.

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,840
You have a death wish?

72
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,087
How could you do that?

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,210
I said there'd be a twist.

74
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,296
Hey.

75
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:44,003
I feel so betrayed.

76
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,270
Hey, me?

77
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,475
Hey.

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,668
No.

79
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,773
How old are you?

80
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,397
How old are you?

81
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,443
I don't know.

82
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,655
How old are you?

83
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:57,699
- That's funny.
- How could you do that?

84
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,069
This might be the reason.

85
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,351
I said I was hesitant
between two people, right?

86
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:05,694
But I already paired with one of them.

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,575
Get what I'm trying to say?

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,637
(Mad)

89
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:14,014
Since I'd already done that,
I thought I'd go with this person.

90
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,035
Should we slap each other?

91
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,075
No.

92
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,882
Let's slap each other.

93
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,444
Have fun on your date.

94
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,641
Have fun on your date.

95
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,610
I'm curious what kind of date it is.

96
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,611
Do you think I need a touch-up?

97
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,470
I think you're very beautiful today.

98
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:34,525
Really?

99
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,150
I wish I could put your
whole makeup on my face.

100
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,693
But doing it yourself is prettier.

101
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:40,940
Really?

102
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,579
I'm so happy. Why does it echo like this?

103
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:46,930
And I was clapping. It startled me.

104
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:48,493
Can I ask you something?

105
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:50,510
Is Ms. Mirang one of the people you like?

106
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,097
Yes.

107
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,530
But honestly, about the date today,

108
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,735
I'd ask someone else if
they had us write it down.

109
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,846
Why's that?

110
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,825
The person who's upfront is Ms. Mirang.

111
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,999
Another person who doesn't know me yet.

112
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,127
I want to let her know
I'm interested in her.

113
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,572
The more I talk, the more nervous I get.

114
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:11,706
But it's so cute when you can feel it.

115
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:12,731
Exactly.

116
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,509
What's wrong?

117
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,275
So nervous I feel hot all over.

118
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,189
Very hot.

119
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:22,471
It's hot.

120
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,964
Anyway.

121
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,569
Don't get hot there.

122
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,270
When you say it's hot,
it looks cute and charming...

123
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,677
That's my weakness.

124
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:32,263
It's very cold but you say it's hot.

125
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,106
"Very hot."

126
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,220
When you show you're truly embarrassed,

127
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:37,650
- you're very beautiful.
- Cute.

128
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:39,684
Like it comes from the heart.

129
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:40,881
I really feel hot.

130
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:44,010
Huh.

131
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,322
It's really pouring down.

132
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,814
I'm like...

133
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,009
really nervous.

134
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,625
You're not nervous?

135
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,173
Me? I'm so nervous right now.

136
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:02,128
Curious what they'll have us do.

137
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:05,113
Hello.

138
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,652
(Dagyo and Mirang
on their exciting first date)

139
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,280
May I sit here?

140
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Sure.

141
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,723
It's freezing.

142
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,911
Better take this off.

143
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,745
I wanted to talk to Ms. Dagyo.

144
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,276
I wanted to know if she liked me too.

145
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,945
I wanted to get to know her better
while we were on a date.

146
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,736
This is amazing.

147
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,522
In the past, I thought

148
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,975
it matters more if I'm
the one who's interested.

149
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:48,791
But Ms. Mirang

150
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,551
chose me.

151
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,156
These actions...

152
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,060
make me curious about

153
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:57,013
the person who likes me.

154
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,083
I felt really shy.

155
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,708
(Can Dagyo sense Mirang's feelings?)

156
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,295
Write your name, today's date,

157
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,349
and your favorite scent.

158
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:11,529
The scent you want to make.

159
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,570
So this place makes fragrances.

160
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,976
I see.

161
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:19,718
(A date in a handmade perfume studio)

162
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,683
When you saw the paintings,
did you think about this?

163
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:26,877
I didn't think about fragrances at all.

164
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:28,007
Me neither.

165
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:30,378
Ms. Dagyo said she liked fragrances.

166
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:32,643
And this place makes perfume.

167
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,952
It was unbelievable.

168
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,605
(Nervous)
And I was thrilled.

169
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,091
Actually earlier,

170
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,625
I just chose the only painting

171
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,090
made by an Eastern artist.

172
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,144
Why did you choose that one?

173
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,000
To be honest, my reason had
nothing to do with the painting.

174
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,355
I just wanted to go on a date with you.

175
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,400
Really?

176
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,486
Okay.

177
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:03,088
You're making me blush.

178
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:06,260
So that's why.

179
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,550
- What's today's date?
- Today...

180
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,175
(A sudden confession is heady.)

181
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,121
Do you remember the date?

182
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,262
Yes.

183
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,369
What scent do you like?

184
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,463
We must decide first

185
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:20,689
if we make our own or the other person's.

186
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,713
Let's make it for the other person.

187
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,557
- For the other person?
- Yes..

188
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,292
The scent you want from the other person.

189
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:30,213
Won't it be weird to
make my own and keep it?

190
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,989
Let's do the exchange so it's meaningful.

191
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,510
So the scent that suits the other person.

192
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:36,900
A suitable scent.

193
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,385
Or the scent we want to smell?

194
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,430
Which is better?

195
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,485
Let's go with a suitable scent.

196
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,534
A suitable scent.

197
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,751
Very difficult.

198
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:44,962
The scent you want to smell.

199
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:46,840
I'll go with a suitable scent.

200
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,223
Me too.

201
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,137
(Mirang writes the scent that suits Dagyo.)

202
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,710
A sweet scent.

203
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,826
Because she's very light-skinned.

204
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,226
She looks very lively.

205
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:02,702
Let's see.

206
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,141
(Dagyo thinks hard, unlike Mirang)

207
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,741
Samples would have been nice.

208
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,538
Like a sexy scent.

209
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,876
I see. Not bad.

210
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,360
That'll work.

211
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:18,071
(The shaking legs
indicate the racing hearts)

212
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,760
Flowers? Soap?

213
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:21,492
What suits you?

214
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,718
(Pondering)

215
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:26,085
Maybe cough drops.

216
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:27,515
What?

217
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,211
I think the sexy scent
you mentioned should work.

218
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:33,455
Oh, that's good.

219
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,097
Our clothes today too.

220
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:37,620
- Bikers.
- Yes..

221
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,558
- We're dressed similar.
- Yes.

222
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,394
Even if it wasn't intended.

223
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:44,840
It was intended.

224
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:46,044
How did you know I'd wear...

225
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,955
- We already met this morning.
- You planned it then?

226
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,398
(This morning)
You're here.

227
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:55,274
Yes.

228
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,062
Dagyo's all dressed up.

229
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,601
(Mirang paid attention
to Dagyo's outfit this morning.)

230
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,195
(Staring)

231
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,391
(Thinking hard)
There's one left.

232
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,337
There's one person left. It's possible.

233
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:25,919
(Mirang's dressed to match Dagyo's outfit.)

234
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,145
I'd planned to wear something else.

235
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,120
Because it's cold today.

236
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,618
But I saw your outfit.

237
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,049
Really?

238
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,595
So I dressed to match you.

239
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,197
I'm so touched.

240
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:40,900
It's...

241
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:42,376
She's very sneaky.

242
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,094
How did she get the idea?

243
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,780
It was very unexpected.

244
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,535
You might not get to go on a date with me.

245
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,986
How did she get the idea
of dressing like a biker

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,169
just because she'd seen
me in a leather skirt?

247
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:55,705
For me, it was amazing.

248
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,035
Even if I'd seen it,

249
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
I wouldn't have gotten that idea.

250
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,627
(The date where the two parties
wear similar outfits feels like fate.)

251
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,660
I'm done.

252
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,333
Oh, you wrote similar things.

253
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,564
- I'll take them.
- Yes.

254
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,315
When you like someone,

255
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,893
do you let them know or...

256
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:19,034
me?

257
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,637
Or just observe them?

258
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:22,644
You can't tell?

259
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:24,996
With me?

260
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,205
This is a surprise.

261
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,752
Really?

262
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:33,612
But there were times...

263
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:35,798
when we made eye contact.

264
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:37,559
For me, when you looked at me

265
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,439
and when you let me borrow clothes,

266
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,235
I was confused if you liked me

267
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,150
or you did that just because you were nice.

268
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:46,841
I was curious,
so I thought I'd ask during our date.

269
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,149
I always looked at you.

270
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,099
Really?

271
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,763
When did you look?

272
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,377
I was almost always looking at you.

273
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:00,654
That's why we made eye contact many times.

274
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,480
What's your name?

275
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,260
I'm Kim Mirang.

276
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:05,662
Huh?

277
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:07,445
Kim Mirang.

278
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:09,250
- Mirang.
- Yes. Rang.

279
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,131
Rang? Oh.

280
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,798
(Catching each other's eyes
from the beginning)

281
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,070
(The first day's dinner)

282
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:22,570
Can you eat spicy food?

283
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:27,483
(Mirang's eyes always stop at Dagyo.)

284
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:33,586
(Dagyo senses Mirang's eyes on her.)

285
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:39,287
(The eye contact known only
between the two of them)

286
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,195
Yes, I...

287
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,520
I was very worried.

288
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:45,937
Afraid it was all in my head.

289
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,190
The reason I told her honestly

290
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:54,002
was to see how she would react.

291
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,736
That's why I wanted to confess my feelings

292
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,861
without lying.

293
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:02,392
Did you intend to lend
me your jacket yesterday?

294
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,259
- I did.
- You did?

295
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:07,290
That was intended too.

296
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:10,548
I'm someone...

297
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:12,819
I'm taking great care of it.

298
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,720
I haven't returned it yet.

299
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:18,534
I found out Ms. Mirang
was interested in me.

300
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,338
It feels good.

301
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:21,854
This is what she's like.

302
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,520
So it wasn't just me.

303
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,102
No. I was wondering
what I would do if I get rejected.

304
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,055
If it was all in my head.

305
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,500
If it was just me, then what?

306
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,672
I asked Jinah for
advice about this earlier.

307
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,820
Ms. Jinah?

308
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,368
Jinah asked me directly

309
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,688
if the person I go out with today

310
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,095
was "someone I wanna go on a date with?"

311
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,149
She asked me that.

312
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:47,163
I see. So you...

313
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:48,244
I answered yes.

314
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,721
That you were.

315
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:53,650
(Shy)
It's true.

316
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
I just answered honestly.

317
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,846
Because I didn't need to lie.

318
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:05,829
What?

319
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,360
I thought you were a shy person.

320
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:10,430
Me?

321
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:13,438
But just now I felt you were very upfront.

322
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,938
Better than I thought.

323
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,055
Really?

324
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,548
No, I'm shy.

325
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:20,947
- I'm shy.
- Got shy suddenly?

326
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,220
I really am.

327
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,013
I'm very shy.

328
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,779
But speaking honestly like that

329
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:29,389
makes it easier to manage our feelings.

330
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,878
Before now, I thought

331
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:37,589
Ms. Dagyo didn't have
any feelings for me at all.

332
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:38,934
But she spoke honestly

333
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,247
that she wanted to go on a date with me.

334
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,658
So I think from now on

335
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:47,753
I have to be more straightforward with her.

336
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,587
It's true she spoke like she was shy,

337
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,384
but she said everything she wanted to say.

338
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:55,325
"I did that because I
was interested in you."

339
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,672
She said it all.

340
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,265
She seriously made me blush.

341
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,420
I felt very hot.

342
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:04,357
(Sneaking a glance)

343
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:11,263
(Will their relationship develop further?)

344
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:17,136
If it smells nice, let's apply it here.

345
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:18,464
Oh. Like that?

346
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,004
Wow.

347
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:22,324
I can't get it open.

348
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,235
The oil.

349
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,175
Oh, it's slippery.

350
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,691
This one's not bad.

351
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,636
I have my eye on that one.

352
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,120
What if we have similar taste?

353
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,075
That's a good thing.

354
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,387
It's the scent only the two of us have.

355
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,785
Have you ever made perfume?

356
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:56,284
- Never.
- Never?

357
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:57,339
- You have?
- I...

358
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,449
I know someone who has a perfumery.

359
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,712
- So I've made some.
- With whom?

360
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,392
I don't know.

361
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:08,281
Did you go alone?

362
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,723
I see.

363
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:14,931
Back then when I smelled all the scents...

364
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,367
We had to try out scents, right?
I got a killer headache.

365
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:19,959
Are you having a headache?

366
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,915
Not at all, even after I've smelled a lot.

367
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,932
They're like natural scents.

368
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,297
(Secretly hurt)

369
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:35,956
(Noticing)

370
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,462
I'll mix three scents.

371
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:38,844
Three?

372
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,732
(Awkward atmosphere)
Three?

373
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:44,922
I think I'll just do that.

374
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:47,080
If I smell more scents,
I'll definitely get dizzy.

375
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,016
(Mirang tries to create a mood.)

376
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,300
What's this?

377
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,262
It bugged me but I tried not to care.

378
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:56,676
We've only gone on one
date. We're not dating.

379
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:57,996
Even though it bugged me,

380
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:01,576
it didn't really bother me that much.

381
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,027
(Choosing perfume for each other)
What's this?

382
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,263
I'll mix three scents too.

383
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:07,364
Yes.

384
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,169
- This one?
- Yes.

385
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:12,669
No.3, no.1, no.27.

386
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,458
How about that?

387
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:17,200
What do you think?

388
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,108
Should I remove something?

389
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,304
It'll work, right?

390
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,702
It's not bad.

391
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,194
But must use number 3 as the base.

392
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:24,672
- Let 3 stand out.
- No.3 is the base.

393
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,865
- I trust the expert.
- Sure.

394
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,110
Use no.3.

395
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:29,313
This one is well-made.

396
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:30,750
(Surprised)

397
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,932
About this perfume, you...

398
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,863
Gotta keep it for the next 50 years, right?

399
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,213
Okay.

400
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,607
Would you like some hot coffee?

401
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,071
Actually, anything's good.
But I prefer iced coffee.

402
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:49,440
- Both of you?
- I'd take it hot.

403
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:51,749
I'll take it hot too.

404
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:52,994
Why? Get what you want.

405
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,351
Why are you copying me?

406
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,226
Then I'll take iced coffee.

407
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,424
Older, younger, the same age.
Do you have a preference?

408
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,010
I used to like older women.

409
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,229
Really? You don't look the type.

410
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,323
What about you?

411
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:12,395
- Older?
- Older.

412
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,814
You prefer older.

413
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,291
But I've only been with younger girls

414
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,712
so I think they're charming too.

415
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,696
They have their own charms?

416
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:20,994
As we get older,

417
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,400
we start to worry about
approaching the other person.

418
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:26,221
We start to think more.

419
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,689
But...

420
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,369
But younger girls speak honestly.

421
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:31,939
They're straightforward.

422
00:18:32,993 --> 00:18:34,555
So you have a notion of younger girls.

423
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:39,718
That means older girls are ideal for you.

424
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:43,093
(Pondering)

425
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:46,560
Sometimes I prefer older girls,
sometimes I prefer younger girls.

426
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,380
Really?

427
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,583
Suddenly?

428
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:54,915
Did you say that because I look younger?

429
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,822
But I like younger girls like this too.

430
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:58,533
What are "younger girls like this" like?

431
00:18:58,558 --> 00:18:59,784
You're straightforward.

432
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:02,026
Straightforward.

433
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,497
At first she said she preferred older girls

434
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:07,060
but would probably prefer
younger girls from now on.

435
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:09,662
So I thought there was
no hesitation with this woman.

436
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:14,296
How could she say it
with that much confidence?

437
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:17,634
This is fun.

438
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:18,743
Really?

439
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:20,657
I've been told I'm funny once we're close.

440
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,962
If the other person rarely speaks,

441
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,383
- it will get awkward.
- It's tiring, right?

442
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,314
You responded to my
joke, so I kept talking.

443
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,760
I did?

444
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,486
- Huh?
- I responded to your joke?

445
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,830
But you're very casual.

446
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,871
If someone listens and responds,
the conversation can keep going.

447
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,597
But if they don't,
it's difficult to keep talking.

448
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:42,785
She asked a lot of questions.

449
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,168
And her eyes were...

450
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:48,457
They indicated she was curious about me.

451
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,957
I liked that very much.

452
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:55,696
For me, getting responses
from the other person is crucial.

453
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,694
Her responses. Her reactions.

454
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,758
Those things have an impact on how I talk.

455
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,204
But she listened and answered throughout,

456
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:04,489
so I could keep talking.

457
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:09,438
(Dagyo and Mirang hit it off.)

458
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,002
Wish I had a mirror.

459
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:17,792
A mirror? You look good.

460
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,426
Your eyes are very beautiful.

461
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,659
Really?

462
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:25,886
They're mesmerizing.

463
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,142
You have princess eyes.

464
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,752
- I do?
- Like yesterday

465
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,723
at dinner when we were all together.

466
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,910
It made me ask myself,
"Do I like this style?"

467
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,878
Um, I could sense that.

468
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,128
Your eyebrows are charming too.

469
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,662
Thank you.

470
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,765
I'm so glad

471
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,132
I put on good makeup today.

472
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,054
Please pick a bottle.
I'll put your perfume in it.

473
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,925
Pick the one that suits me.

474
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,650
I already picked one.

475
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:02,721
You did?

476
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:06,103
(Pondering)

477
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:07,245
I'll pick this one.

478
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,221
Oh, this one.

479
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,656
I was gonna pick that one,

480
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:15,038
but you're wearing a white top today.

481
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,125
Um.

482
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:17,968
It looks like a shaved head.

483
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:20,390
That one looks like it has short hair.

484
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:22,164
This looks like someone with long hair.

485
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:25,586
They kind of look like us.

486
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,564
That's hilarious.

487
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,321
We'll take these, sir.

488
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:33,916
Please write something you want to write

489
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:35,689
and stick it on.

490
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,210
I see. Write whatever we want?

491
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,671
Yes, go ahead and write whatever you want.

492
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:47,341
(Both are reflecting to capture
the memory of their first date.)

493
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:54,732
(How will they remember this day?)

494
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:01,757
Why do you feel that shy?

495
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:04,574
It's kind of funny.

496
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,968
So I'm gonna stick it on.

497
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:14,117
Ms. Mirang was acting
like she felt very shy,

498
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:15,555
but she flirted with me a lot.

499
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,025
I liked it very much.

500
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,658
The way she was very direct.
There was no hesitation.

501
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:23,645
I didn't expect her

502
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,200
to let me in on things that much.

503
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,430
After the date,

504
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:31,315
I'm confident that

505
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,297
I've made my decision.

506
00:22:33,517 --> 00:22:40,142
In my heart right now,
Ms. Dagyo is the best.

507
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,285
- After you.
- Thank you.

508
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,754
Hello.

509
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:49,090
Hello.

510
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,927
Hello.

511
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,068
The activity you both will be doing today

512
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:55,913
is decorate your own glass.

513
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:58,397
(Heeyoung and Jinah's second date)

514
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,889
(Tasting newly brewed beer)

515
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,578
(and doing many activities together)

516
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:04,553
Have fun.

517
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:06,615
- Thank you.
- Please go to the third floor.

518
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,811
We will. Shall we take the stairs?

519
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:14,635
Doing things related to beer
that I'd never done before,

520
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,135
it was interesting.

521
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,127
I felt really good.

522
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:21,994
Wow.

523
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:25,796
Those are souvenirs.

524
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:28,548
Turn beer into products.

525
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,713
But I drink this brand more often.

526
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:31,833
You've had this before?

527
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,873
I've had this one. Wit Ale.

528
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
Wit Ale.

529
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:38,237
- I've never had Geomeng Ale.
- What's Geomeng?

530
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,637
This one isn't very
fruity. It's pretty good.

531
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:47,567
It's a brand of beer that I like.

532
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,786
I'm the type to do romantic things

533
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:51,686
when I get to know someone,

534
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:52,811
so I liked it very much.

535
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,838
(Jinah's happy with the date.)
Buy and...

536
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:58,940
This is wine.

537
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,206
Cute.

538
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:09,803
Thank you.

539
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:12,534
Please drink from left to right.

540
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,963
The Wit Ale beer is our bestseller.
Perfect with a candied orange slice.

541
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,690
Please try them together.

542
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:20,550
Wow, finally.

543
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:22,316
We finally get alcohol.

544
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:23,769
Suddenly look lively.

545
00:24:25,987 --> 00:24:27,317
Let's take pictures.

546
00:24:32,866 --> 00:24:35,153
(Heeyoung doesn't forget
to pick up a film camera.)

547
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,937
Can I take your pictures today?

548
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:43,343
With this by my side? Good.

549
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,975
On one of the samples is an orange slice.

550
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,567
I felt, "Wow, this is clearly a date."

551
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,872
Beautiful things make me feel good.

552
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,098
I probably like picturesque dates.

553
00:24:57,158 --> 00:24:58,533
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

554
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,852
It's very sweet at first.

555
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:07,945
So good.

556
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,110
It tastes so good.

557
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,169
It's not sweet.

558
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:14,059
Uh, yes.

559
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:17,325
It's so good.

560
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,765
I'm not a beer drinker,
so I was very worried.

561
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,250
But it was very delicious.
I had fun and was happy.

562
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,922
Cheers.

563
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:35,666
I like this one.

564
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:37,386
Can you drink fruity beer?

565
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,495
Um.

566
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,370
But I...

567
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,010
really love clinking glasses.

568
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,502
You know the saying
"clinking clear glasses"?

569
00:25:45,572 --> 00:25:48,080
- This one?
- You know it?

570
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:51,143
This works. This works.

571
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:53,283
Three-quarters?

572
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:57,658
(They're getting closer
while enjoying beer.)

573
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,805
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

574
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,578
This is a DIY project.

575
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,937
Decorating your own beer glass.

576
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,804
- Be careful because it's irreversible.
- Okay.

577
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:09,876
You must proceed with caution.

578
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,759
- Shall we start?
- Yes.

579
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,182
I want to make it for you.

580
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,900
But I have no art
skills. Will that be okay?

581
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:18,734
Will an ugly glass deter you?

582
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,171
No, but it'll be more meaningful if we

583
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:23,203
- make it for each other.
- Good, okay.

584
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:25,064
I'm not confident either.

585
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:26,791
Let's try.

586
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,725
I like things in pair.

587
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,146
I just love this kind of activities.

588
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,057
I was very happy.

589
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,074
I'll try to make it simple and cool.

590
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:42,910
Oh, dang it.

591
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:46,253
More difficult than I thought.

592
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:49,558
Just know that I'm doing my best.

593
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,276
I got a bad one.

594
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:00,294
Sorry.

595
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:05,487
- I already apologized. Sorry.
- Yeah.

596
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:08,584
We already agreed it's
the thought that counts.

597
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,170
Dang it. Sorry.

598
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,773
(An apology-filled glass decoration)
Let's decorate new ones with "Sorry."

599
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,240
But since the second day, I've felt

600
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,294
I can read other people now.

601
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:28,857
I actually couldn't read you at all.

602
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:31,115
Yeah?

603
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,263
Me?

604
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,795
Can I be frank?

605
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:37,482
Now that we're focusing,
you can just listen.

606
00:27:38,326 --> 00:27:42,209
I think that

607
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:45,256
you're trying to let me know that

608
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:48,398
you want to try meeting other people.

609
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:50,024
When we talked yesterday?

610
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,015
But having second thoughts in the beginning

611
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,085
is quite understandable.

612
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,265
I think it's natural.

613
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,505
Like things have boiling points
at different temperatures.

614
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,102
Really? I can do that?

615
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:06,321
Of course you can.

616
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,649
When you said I could try that.

617
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,962
Remember what you said?

618
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:18,399
At the time, we talked honestly.

619
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:20,949
And we just happened to talk about that.

620
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,709
So I shared my view.

621
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,425
Based on the reality

622
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,150
of the situation at the time.

623
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:31,017
I didn't say that with a goal in mind.

624
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,288
If you want to do that, you can.

625
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,968
It's better to feel less
uncomfortable, right?

626
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:41,210
Actually, I didn't care.

627
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,850
But it's like Ms. Dagyo

628
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,991
our roommate said,

629
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,375
now I...

630
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:54,672
want to get to know you.

631
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,844
However,

632
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,898
"there's something special here,
let me look back a little."

633
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:02,524
I don't mind if that's the case.

634
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,726
It's true that this is a place
to try with different people,

635
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,372
I want to know her. I
have feelings for her.

636
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:13,858
I want a little reciprocation.

637
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:15,671
I don't know.

638
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:18,959
(Jinah wants clear feelings
from both parties.)

639
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:24,233
I also think that

640
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,849
the first impression is gone.

641
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,420
We came here

642
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,349
to try

643
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:35,481
with different people.

644
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:39,583
But we went on the first date together.

645
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:42,340
Some people may not like that.

646
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,910
In the last two days,

647
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:48,956
I've done everything with Ms. Jinah.

648
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,485
To be honest, it's too fast for me.

649
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,877
And I thought she would agree.

650
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,463
So when we randomly paired up
for the second date,

651
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:01,353
I wanted to go with someone else.

652
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:05,105
That way, my relationship

653
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,812
with Ms. Jinah might be more balanced.

654
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,541
(Heeyoung carefully analyzes
her own feelings.)

655
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,767
I...

656
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:15,994
What I think is...

657
00:30:17,244 --> 00:30:20,805
I thought you wanted to dump me.

658
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,945
Unbelievable, right?

659
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:25,648
It's like... because when we

660
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:29,135
went on our first date,
we didn't know how to act,

661
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,919
so we didn't talk much.

662
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,297
But I'm someone who talks a lot
when I'm uncomfortable.

663
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,596
I might have talked too much about myself.

664
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:36,979
I see.

665
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:41,806
Or I might have done something
that makes you think we're not a good fit.

666
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:43,705
Something like that.

667
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,346
I might be too much of a coward

668
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:48,917
and misunderstand everything.

669
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,323
But when we go out by ourselves,

670
00:30:51,587 --> 00:30:53,571
does she feel uncomfortable?

671
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:57,048
Does she want to get to know other people?

672
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,240
I keep wondering about this.

673
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,043
So I'm a little hurt.

674
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:05,582
(Jinah's words push Heeyoung
to think more carefully.)

675
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,130
Honestly, I already said I'm someone

676
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,645
who thinks things through
and goes step by step.

677
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,866
I think you already knew that.

678
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:19,275
Moving too fast makes me uncomfortable.

679
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,085
It's true that things are
going in that direction.

680
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:25,730
On the contrary, I really don't want to
make the other person uncomfortable.

681
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,086
I don't know your view on this
that makes you feel this way.

682
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:32,547
But to me personally,

683
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:36,251
we're trying to define things too quickly.

684
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:39,836
My true feelings should be filtered.

685
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:43,220
My decisions should be made with freedom.

686
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,532
- I think this is very important.
- Of course.

687
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:48,037
(Heeyoung values making choices
based on feelings, not situations)

688
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:50,092
To be honest,

689
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:53,421
yes, it'll definitely come out.
I'm very straightforward.

690
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:56,617
If I'm think something, it'll come out.

691
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,303
If you say, "This is the only way,"

692
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:01,595
I'll feel very uncomfortable.

693
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,058
So I said if we moved forward too quickly,

694
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:08,420
it wouldn't work for me.

695
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:10,910
But I'm not hiding anything.

696
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:12,993
But if that's what you're saying,

697
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,728
maybe going on dates with other people

698
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,142
will make the uneasy feeling
I'm focusing on disappear.

699
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:22,799
Clearly.

700
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:28,265
I will feel that my actions

701
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,933
don't give you the wrong impression.

702
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,318
I like that.

703
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,063
- Um.
- But...

704
00:32:34,408 --> 00:32:37,017
before that happens,
I wanted to go on another date.

705
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:39,636
- Another date.
- With me?

706
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:42,898
- Give it another try.
- And try with others after that.

707
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:44,970
Yes, then decide what you want.

708
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,165
- I wanted to give it another try.
- Another try.

709
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,033
- I see.
- That's how I feel.

710
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:51,790
(Telling each other honestly how they feel)

711
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:55,635
At this point, the person
who shows interest in me,

712
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,097
from what I can tell, is just one person.

713
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,368
That feeling revolves
around only this person.

714
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:04,111
For me, it's too fast.

715
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:09,570
(Since arriving at the ToGetHer House,
Heeyoung has spent time with only Jinah.)

716
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,992
When I feel that way,

717
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:15,101
it gives me pause.

718
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,945
I feel confused.

719
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,680
I prefer taking things slow.

720
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,472
I feel we express ourselves differently

721
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:29,926
or there's something that

722
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:32,137
doesn't click.

723
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:33,297
When we're with others too.

724
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:36,256
When I said I wanted to know her better,

725
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:40,195
she said we were allowed
to get to know different people.

726
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:45,054
Whenever I think we can be
each other's special someone,

727
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,913
I feel totally baffled.

728
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:55,685
(Their different speeds
in developing a romantic relationship)

729
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,465
Are we the first pair here?

730
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,425
You think that's the case?

731
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:05,865
- Probably.
- Right?

732
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,096
We finished the activity very quickly
and we're back early.

733
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:12,608
Dagyo?

734
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:14,616
She's not here.

735
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:17,725
Can't wait to hear about her date.

736
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:19,116
Same.

737
00:34:20,203 --> 00:34:25,054
(Hangyeol has returned from the date.)

738
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,195
Hello.

739
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,022
You're back.

740
00:34:30,046 --> 00:34:32,241
You're all here.

741
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:33,999
Hey, you're here.

742
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:35,164
There was a hailstorm.

743
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:36,227
You're here.

744
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,384
I don't know which room to use.

745
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,649
Should we call someone?

746
00:34:40,674 --> 00:34:42,109
(Standing up suddenly)

747
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:44,207
Who are my roommates?

748
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:45,699
Who stay in here?

749
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:49,031
Whose room is this?

750
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:50,676
Ms. Mirang and Ms. Seoyeon.

751
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,910
I see.

752
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,051
So you two share the room.

753
00:34:57,237 --> 00:35:00,673
Do you mind covering
your nose when you sleep?

754
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,265
- Mirang pretends to not hear.
- Huh?

755
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,774
Now that we're sharing the room,

756
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,532
do you mind showing me around?

757
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:09,679
Sure.

758
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:14,329
(Suddenly awkward, not knowing
what they are to each other.)

759
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:18,977
The snoring comment. Is she her ex?

760
00:35:19,002 --> 00:35:21,359
She knows even her sleeping habits.

761
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:24,196
- That's true.
- They might not be exes.

762
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:27,195
(Curious)

763
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,140
(Curiosity grows due to
Minwoo and Mirang's relationship)

764
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,176
Why do they put us in the same room?

765
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:36,474
Dang it.

766
00:35:40,156 --> 00:35:41,578
(Hitting)

767
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:47,671
Dang it.

768
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,184
It's so funny.

769
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:52,965
I'm gonna faint.

770
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,215
Frankly, she's someone I know.

771
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:58,865
We have opposite personalities.

772
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,390
And she's not my type.

773
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:03,997
Our types are very different.

774
00:36:04,022 --> 00:36:06,679
To be honest, courting someone

775
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:08,993
in front of your friend

776
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:11,118
is embarrassing.

777
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:12,399
It's bugging me.

778
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,704
But on the other hand,

779
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:17,466
I was so excited earlier.

780
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,545
It's like I have someone to rely on.

781
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,676
I hope she finds someone nice
before the show ends.

782
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,315
Ms. Minwoo.

783
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,817
If you don't mind, we can share this bed.

784
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,130
Yes, looks like this one's bigger.

785
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:35,065
Really?

786
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,032
- Is it bigger.
- I think she snores.

787
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:40,454
(Smiling)

788
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:41,837
I see. Okay.

789
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:45,126
- We can share the bed.
- Okay.

790
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,798
I think they're exes.

791
00:36:48,823 --> 00:36:51,049
So I thought her sharing my bed

792
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,066
would help separate them.

793
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:56,606
So I asked if she wanted to share my bed.

794
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,029
- When she said,
- We can share this bed.

795
00:36:59,054 --> 00:37:01,247
"We can share this bed,"

796
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,880
I thought she was hitting on me.

797
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:07,842
I imagined a lot of things at the time.

798
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,647
How was your date?

799
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:11,592
Um...

800
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,834
At first I was worried
I would be the one talking,

801
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,638
but she's chatty.

802
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:22,264
Ms. Dagyo seems like an adaptive person.

803
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:26,189
Really? Some people are chatty in a group

804
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:28,996
but not as much one-on-one.

805
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:31,371
I thought she was like that.

806
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,220
- But she...
- I guess it went well.

807
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:37,308
Small talk first, then honest talk.

808
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:39,521
I think we were honest
about a lot of things.

809
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:41,135
- I see.
- With Ms. Dagyo.

810
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,828
That requires a one-on-one date.

811
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:44,148
Um, yes.

812
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,774
But I still don't know.

813
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:52,204
Because this was the first time
we went out with another person.

814
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,962
You did that to me. Why
didn't you make it count?

815
00:37:57,747 --> 00:37:58,847
There is a possibility.

816
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:00,191
There is a possibility.

817
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,254
It's unbelievable that
everyone says it's totally different.

818
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:07,621
- I know.
- Yesterday everyone said

819
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:11,669
being outside was
totally different from being inside.

820
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:14,060
- But I didn't believe it.
- Totally different, right?

821
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:17,100
Today, when I was out, I could feel it.

822
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,631
A totally different person.

823
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,731
- You could feel it, right?
- Um.

824
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:23,739
I'm gonna change.

825
00:38:26,185 --> 00:38:27,585
How was your date?

826
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:28,829
Date?

827
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:31,376
Today's date.

828
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:33,381
- Did it go okay?
- Yes.

829
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:35,367
Yes, I had a blast.

830
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,680
I'm very happy with this date.

831
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,109
I had a lot of fun.

832
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:43,617
I see.

833
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,327
It sounds cold.

834
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:47,414
I just want to know more

835
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:49,360
after you guys talked today.

836
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:50,923
Of course you do.

837
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,019
Can I use the trial products make pasta?

838
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,673
Are there eight of us?

839
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:01,052
Eight, yes.

840
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:02,130
Because there's one more.

841
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:04,420
So we should open all four bottles.

842
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:07,405
Tomato sauce and cream sauce.

843
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,944
Mix them to make rosé sauce.

844
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:10,436
Are we making that much?

845
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:13,998
Why don't we use one each?

846
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,395
Because we'll grill some meat too.

847
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,018
- We're grilling meat?
- Yes.

848
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:18,354
Wonderful.

849
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,393
Because we can just

850
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:23,253
mix two things to make rosé sauce,

851
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,526
Great idea. Otherwise we'll be exhausting.

852
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,816
Champignon mushroom.

853
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:29,406
Champignon mushroom.

854
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:32,833
Here.

855
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,164
Can I see you guys cook?

856
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:38,255
Just sit there and chat.

857
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,473
Want some help?

858
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,442
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

859
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,192
- Just go sit.
- Sit and chat.

860
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:45,911
- Flirt.
- Can't have more people.

861
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,833
Really?

862
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,926
(Don't disturb while cooking)

863
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:52,879
I'll just sit here.

864
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,489
When the eight of us are together,

865
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,965
(The ToGetHer House is crowded)
it's much more crowded.

866
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,173
Don't you want to know about her?

867
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,837
I want to know a lot of things.

868
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:09,242
I want to know about everyone
because we barely know anything.

869
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,101
Oh, I see.

870
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,820
We keep saying we want to know.

871
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:16,516
I wish we could all open up today.

872
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,650
True.

873
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,075
(Curious)

874
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:20,852
I'm really curious.

875
00:40:23,032 --> 00:40:24,096
Really curious.

876
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,937
(Starting to get curious about each other)

877
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,535
(Glancing)

878
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:32,008
At the time I...

879
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:35,351
(Mirang hands Minwoo the purple enzyme.)

880
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:37,001
- Have some.
- Oh.

881
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:39,470
Ms. Jinah's good at explaining this.

882
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,206
I have to take this one.

883
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,825
You have to right now.

884
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,099
I'm on a diet. This is perfect.

885
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:48,357
Ms. Jinah, do we take this before meals?

886
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:49,382
After meals.

887
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:50,821
After we have a meal,

888
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:54,154
it will break down the enzymes in the food

889
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:56,053
that didn't break down.

890
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,437
I see.

891
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,771
It helps accelerate...

892
00:40:58,796 --> 00:40:59,982
I see.

893
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:02,068
But there's no fishy flavor,

894
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,710
so it's easy to consume
for people of all ages.

895
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:07,358
It has that enzyme
present in the saliva, amylase.

896
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:12,164
I have to consume things
that contain Alzheimer's.

897
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:14,228
- Amylase, not Alzheimer's.
- Sorry.

898
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:16,025
- Amylase.
- Yes.

899
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,049
Alzheimer's?

900
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:20,698
(Embarrassed)

901
00:41:21,384 --> 00:41:23,354
(Focusing on chopping mushroom)

902
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:24,635
I use chopsticks.

903
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,633
(The totally different sizes of mushroom)

904
00:41:28,704 --> 00:41:29,704
(Sneaking)

905
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:33,320
It's like an artwork.

906
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:35,667
That's why I said it was like a sculpture.

907
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,407
A champignon mushroom sculpture.

908
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,150
Like a creative work of art.

909
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:41,260
What should I do? I'm dying.

910
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:42,269
It's okay.

911
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:44,268
Choices in food are fun.

912
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,659
Large ones. Small ones.

913
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:47,385
You're very good.

914
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,417
Will I be yelled at?

915
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:51,574
(The sizes of mushroom that look organized)

916
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,785
You're good.

917
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,904
You're cutting like you're in "Death Note."

918
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,359
(Mad)
Don't worry.

919
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:03,313
What if someone says I'm a horrible cook?

920
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,889
(Looking left and right)

921
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:09,412
Where's the pepper, Ms. Hangyeol?

922
00:42:09,437 --> 00:42:13,327
The pepper... Where's the pepper? Oh, here.

923
00:42:14,124 --> 00:42:16,682
Put it on the table
so people can add what they like.

924
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:24,690
(Minwoo who only pays
attention to Hangyeol)

925
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,399
If you're bored, want a few sips?

926
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:31,649
Good.

927
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,329
Right now I'm...

928
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:36,032
a very bad cook.

929
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:38,760
You have to help with so many things.

930
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:42,338
If I'm interested in
someone, I will express it

931
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:44,769
by teasing that person.

932
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:47,544
And whenever I tease Ms. Hangyeol,
I always get a reaction.

933
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:48,583
So I...

934
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,698
want to keep teasing her.

935
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,472
(Tomato pasta)

936
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:58,394
(Pork belly)

937
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:01,697
- Wow, so much food.
- Grilled pork looks yummy.

938
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:03,005
We did our best.

939
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,589
Full dishes of food.

940
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,143
- That's right -

941
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,572
You must be tired. Cheers.

942
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:09,914
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

943
00:43:09,939 --> 00:43:11,228
Cheers.

944
00:43:19,576 --> 00:43:21,607
We must chat after we finish eating.

945
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:24,779
Hm!

946
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:26,904
Is it good?

947
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:32,067
Do you know that IKEA sells pasta?

948
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,161
It's delicious.

949
00:43:33,186 --> 00:43:35,389
No, I think this is better
than what IKEA sells.

950
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,264
IKEA...

951
00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:38,480
That startled me.

952
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:40,535
- What?
- It's a mess.

953
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:47,630
(Everyone in the ToGetHer House,
you may introduce yourself.)

954
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:49,179
What? What?

955
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:50,647
Just like that.

956
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,593
I'm so happy.

957
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:55,352
But it's good we get to do that

958
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:57,159
- after you arrived.
- Yes.

959
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:00,325
I think I'm really fortunate.

960
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,387
So far it's been very uncomfortable because

961
00:44:03,412 --> 00:44:05,269
our conversations had limitations.

962
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:08,419
Now we can eat and talk at the same time.

963
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:12,583
I'm curious the most about Ms. Heeyoung.

964
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:17,973
(After the date, Heeyoung's more worried.)

965
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,458
(Starting from Mirang)
Should we just do it?

966
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:21,652
- I go first?
- Yes.

967
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,175
- Go ahead.
- Hurry.

968
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,691
First of all, my age...

969
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:29,410
I thought she must have been
in her early or mid 20s.

970
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:31,321
I'm so curious.

971
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:34,172
I was born in 1991.

972
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:37,422
She looks so young.

973
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:38,595
She looks super young.

974
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:40,875
I was shocked.

975
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,040
I thought she couldn't be
two years older than me.

976
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:46,432
How can she look so young?

977
00:44:46,807 --> 00:44:48,705
(Shocked)
She looks so young.

978
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,572
- Really?
- She looks super young.

979
00:44:51,257 --> 00:44:52,702
Only my heart is in my 20s.

980
00:44:52,727 --> 00:44:55,232
That sentence is much funnier.

981
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,937
Only my heart is in my 20s.

982
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,827
And MBTI?

983
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:01,079
Oh, MBTI?

984
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,061
What's your MBTI?

985
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:04,850
I'm ESTJ.

986
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:08,395
(Mirang is ESTJ.)
ESTJ?

987
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,115
And my job is...

988
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,601
And my job is...

989
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,435
a real estate agent.

990
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,943
- Very unexpected.
- Really?

991
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:24,607
That's unbelievable.

992
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:27,741
I was shocked by her job too.
It was really unexpected.

993
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,746
That job never crossed my mind.

994
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,444
She doesn't look like those agents.

995
00:45:31,832 --> 00:45:34,949
Mirang works in real estate.

996
00:45:35,173 --> 00:45:36,660
I thought she worked

997
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:39,649
in fitness or a restaurant.

998
00:45:39,674 --> 00:45:41,095
Very unexpected.

999
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:44,152
I also manage buildings.

1000
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,499
I work as a real estate agent

1001
00:45:55,524 --> 00:45:57,922
and I manage many buildings.

1002
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:02,741
I want to see how capable I am

1003
00:46:02,766 --> 00:46:04,768
and I want to try running a business.

1004
00:46:05,183 --> 00:46:09,407
That's why I chose to work in real estate.

1005
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:20,134
(Mirang, real estate agent
and building manager)

1006
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:23,393
Now I live in Gyeonggi.

1007
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:25,636
I'm 31 years old.

1008
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:27,511
- I see.
- Yes.

1009
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,811
Born in 1995.

1010
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,169
And my MBTI is INTP.

1011
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:40,349
It's been single for two years now.

1012
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:42,713
Very detailed.

1013
00:46:43,313 --> 00:46:45,080
My job is a secret.

1014
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:47,924
(My job is a secret.)
Okay.

1015
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:53,727
(One secret the ToGetHer House guests
want to keep)

1016
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:56,008
I'm even more curious

1017
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,258
now that it's a secret.

1018
00:46:57,283 --> 00:46:58,799
(Curious)

1019
00:46:59,564 --> 00:47:01,485
She probably has a shopping mall.

1020
00:47:03,356 --> 00:47:05,928
If there's one secret I want to keep,

1021
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:07,572
it's definitely my job.

1022
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:12,141
I want to date someone who doesn't care

1023
00:47:12,423 --> 00:47:14,643
about things that come with me.

1024
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,564
Because I'm confident
I can find someone like that.

1025
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,485
I want her to see me for me.

1026
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,727
Okay.

1027
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:27,939
I live in Seoul.

1028
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,348
My age...

1029
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:37,297
My age... I was born in 2000.

1030
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:39,422
I knew it. She's so cute.

1031
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:42,357
I see. Not that much younger.

1032
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:44,935
Hearing her age

1033
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,107
has pushed me look at reality

1034
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,421
that our views on love may be different.

1035
00:47:50,762 --> 00:47:52,538
I'm just thinking ahead.

1036
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,105
When I heard her age,

1037
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,650
I was like, "Aren't you too young?"

1038
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,574
"Does she think I'm too old?"

1039
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:01,926
I was taken aback. It was unexpected.

1040
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:06,183
Dagyo is younger than I thought.
I thought she was young

1041
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:08,809
but older than her real age.

1042
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:12,044
Based on the vibe I got from her,

1043
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:14,845
I thought she was around that age,

1044
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:16,439
so I wasn't shocked.

1045
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:18,404
- Oh, my MBTI.
- Yes, yes.

1046
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,231
My MBTI is ESTJ.

1047
00:48:21,256 --> 00:48:22,956
- I see. ESTJ.
- Oh!

1048
00:48:24,898 --> 00:48:26,575
You two are the same?

1049
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,244
Yes, ESTJ.

1050
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:29,535
I see.

1051
00:48:30,222 --> 00:48:32,143
I work as a radiographer.

1052
00:48:32,168 --> 00:48:33,971
I work in a hospital.

1053
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:36,073
Oh. Wow.

1054
00:48:37,618 --> 00:48:41,579
She probably wears a white lab coat.
She works in a hospital, right?

1055
00:48:41,604 --> 00:48:43,579
When I picture that,

1056
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:45,626
I feel it suits her image.

1057
00:48:45,651 --> 00:48:46,876
I like her even more now.

1058
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,812
I'm Park Dagyo, 26 years old.
I work as a radiographer.

1059
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:54,859
(X-ray Room)

1060
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,948
In my work, I mainly X-ray patients.

1061
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:02,729
I work in a hospital
that mainly treats children.

1062
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:06,438
Please stay still and don't move.

1063
00:49:08,868 --> 00:49:11,774
I casually explain the steps.

1064
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:13,352
When I talk to the patients

1065
00:49:13,377 --> 00:49:15,217
is when I feel proud of my work.

1066
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,436
I think medical personnel

1067
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:20,408
should be reliable and responsible.

1068
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:24,323
(Park Dagyo, radiographer)

1069
00:49:29,706 --> 00:49:33,049
I'm an indie singer/songwriter.

1070
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:35,714
I'm also a freelance songwriter.

1071
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,255
I expected her

1072
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,320
to work in something that uses feelings.

1073
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,320
I thought she might write books.

1074
00:49:44,345 --> 00:49:46,000
I didn't think of music at all.

1075
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:51,428
My name is Jeong Hangyeol, working as...

1076
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:53,227
a singer/songwriter.

1077
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:56,952
Actually, in other countries,
there are a lot of artists who

1078
00:49:56,977 --> 00:50:00,247
come out and work in this field a lot.

1079
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:04,792
But I thought why Korea
doesn't have singers

1080
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:06,347
who are lesbians?

1081
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:08,217
So it's my intention

1082
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:11,404
to introduce myself as a singer/songwriter.

1083
00:50:13,264 --> 00:50:15,130
(Hangyeol, singer/songwriter)

1084
00:50:17,493 --> 00:50:19,333
And I want to

1085
00:50:19,412 --> 00:50:22,638
keep my age a secret.

1086
00:50:22,663 --> 00:50:24,998
Everyone can tell she's the youngest.

1087
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:27,976
She should have chosen
a different secret than can be concealed.

1088
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,453
Instead, she conceals an obvious thing.

1089
00:50:30,478 --> 00:50:33,492
So I feel that she's quite innocent.

1090
00:50:33,517 --> 00:50:34,750
I'm so curious.

1091
00:50:34,775 --> 00:50:35,890
I know.

1092
00:50:36,976 --> 00:50:39,577
My MBTI is INTJ.

1093
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,039
INTJ.

1094
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:42,359
(Hangyeol, INTJ)

1095
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:45,478
I'm Kim Jinah.

1096
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:47,378
I was born in 1994.

1097
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,362
You look very young.

1098
00:50:49,387 --> 00:50:50,575
Born in 1994.

1099
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,810
I'm working two jobs.

1100
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,412
First, I write psychology essays.

1101
00:50:55,437 --> 00:50:58,044
- Oh, you're a writer.
- Yes, I write essays.

1102
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:59,764
My other job is a complete opposite.

1103
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:02,135
I'm the youngest executive
in a startup company

1104
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,864
in creative AI data.

1105
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,077
(Amazing)

1106
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:09,014
- You're so talented.
- Right?

1107
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,289
I was thinking she was a very good speaker.

1108
00:51:11,314 --> 00:51:14,954
When I heard that, I
was like, "I knew it. See?"

1109
00:51:14,979 --> 00:51:18,157
"That's why." My reaction was genuine.

1110
00:51:18,415 --> 00:51:20,047
That's why.

1111
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:22,515
Hello, I'm Kim Jinah, 31 years old.

1112
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,575
I'm the youngest executive committee
member of an AI startup company

1113
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,352
in Korea.

1114
00:51:30,665 --> 00:51:32,431
The main service of our company

1115
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,383
is provided by our IT department.

1116
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:36,415
As for other areas such
as talking to our clients

1117
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,893
and all things management related
are supervised by me.

1118
00:51:41,626 --> 00:51:44,281
(Jinah's another job is
writing psychology essays.)

1119
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,659
I originally enjoyed writing

1120
00:51:46,684 --> 00:51:48,909
messages on social media.

1121
00:51:48,934 --> 00:51:51,651
Then a publisher contacted me.

1122
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:53,269
So I automatically became

1123
00:51:53,294 --> 00:51:55,105
an essay writer

1124
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:58,644
and I've been writing essays ever since.

1125
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:02,446
(Jinah, AI startup executive & writer)

1126
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:05,666
And you guys suspected I was a newscaster.

1127
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,254
I started working as a newscaster.

1128
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:11,559
Your voice is sweet like
there's a cotton candy filter.

1129
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,055
As a kid I planned that

1130
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,750
I had to become a newscaster,

1131
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:19,110
so I naturally became a newscaster.

1132
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,706
I worked as a newscaster into my late 20s.

1133
00:52:21,832 --> 00:52:25,048
Suddenly, I felt I had enough of it

1134
00:52:25,073 --> 00:52:27,445
and wanted to work
in something totally different.

1135
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:29,875
So I decided to quit.

1136
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:33,895
My MBTI is INFJ.

1137
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,079
But since I worked as a newscaster first,

1138
00:52:37,508 --> 00:52:40,955
I adopted a habit of enduring dead air
because I couldn't show awkwardness.

1139
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,055
- Oh, so that's why.
- So talented.

1140
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,640
That's why I haven't
gone on many blind dates.

1141
00:52:50,722 --> 00:52:52,116
So cool.

1142
00:52:55,276 --> 00:52:57,749
My name is Kim Seoyeon.

1143
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:00,131
I'm really curious about you.

1144
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,463
My age... I was born in 1993.

1145
00:53:04,488 --> 00:53:07,716
I told you I was the oldest.

1146
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,545
And my MBTI is INFJ.

1147
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,635
Really?

1148
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,270
- You're the same.
- Really?

1149
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:16,417
My job...

1150
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,424
My job... I used to work

1151
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,696
as a video PD for an entertainment
company for 4-5 years.

1152
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,012
That job never crossed my mind.

1153
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:32,754
But I quit that job and now

1154
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:34,295
I'm running my own business.

1155
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,846
Really? That job's really unexpected.

1156
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,979
She used to be a PD.
I think that's so cool.

1157
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:45,475
I used to be a video PD
for an entertainment company.

1158
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,005
Now I'm preparing to run my own business.

1159
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,429
My business has to do with adult products.

1160
00:53:50,454 --> 00:53:52,815
We develop products for women

1161
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,563
and are preparing to sell them.

1162
00:53:55,588 --> 00:53:56,815
When it comes to adult products,

1163
00:53:56,839 --> 00:54:01,475
women are often objectified and sexualized.

1164
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,979
I don't want women to be objectified,

1165
00:54:05,004 --> 00:54:08,642
so I live by a motto,
"Focusing on women's sexual desire"

1166
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:11,979
to upgrade adult products.

1167
00:54:12,004 --> 00:54:13,924
That's why I do business in this field.

1168
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:19,958
(Seoyeon, running her own business)

1169
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:23,124
(Heeyoung's the last one)
Ms. Heeyoung.

1170
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:24,594
Wow, the last one.

1171
00:54:25,835 --> 00:54:28,921
My name is Park Heeyoung.

1172
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:33,212
I want to call her "Older Sister."
Please be older.

1173
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,880
I was born in 1993.

1174
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:40,771
(Surprised)

1175
00:54:40,818 --> 00:54:42,099
(Seoyeon's age)
The same age.

1176
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:46,894
Wow, I didn't expect this at all.

1177
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:49,747
So you two are the same age?

1178
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:52,872
(Shocked)
What's wrong? Why are you that shocked?

1179
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:56,255
I thought she was a lot younger than me.

1180
00:54:57,006 --> 00:54:58,872
I thought she was my age.

1181
00:54:58,897 --> 00:55:00,833
- I'm so shocked.
- So you're older.

1182
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,872
I was shocked. She looks really young.

1183
00:55:03,897 --> 00:55:06,256
I thought she was
in her early 20s, but she's my age.

1184
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,834
I suddenly felt ashamed next to her.

1185
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:11,569
Her age is completely unexpected.

1186
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:13,655
I thought she was my age.

1187
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,775
But she said she was born in 1993.

1188
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,854
But that big gap in age makes me
want to go on a date with her even more.

1189
00:55:18,879 --> 00:55:20,182
I like older girls.

1190
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:24,971
Oh, as for MBTI,
I really don't like talking about it.

1191
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:27,645
It's overlapping.

1192
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:28,959
I see.

1193
00:55:28,984 --> 00:55:32,585
I feel uncomfortable
to tell you just one thing.

1194
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,828
I go back and forth between INFP and INTP.

1195
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:37,180
- Really?
- Yes, it's overlapping.

1196
00:55:38,678 --> 00:55:43,052
As for my job, I'll tell you
when we know each other better.

1197
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:45,661
- Oh, your job.
- A chef.

1198
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:47,617
A chef?

1199
00:55:47,642 --> 00:55:49,024
I'll cook today.

1200
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,798
Actually, I want to know
what Heeyoung does for a living.

1201
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:57,959
But she wouldn't say.

1202
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,937
She looks like a bar owner.

1203
00:56:00,168 --> 00:56:03,230
Suits for mixing cocktails.

1204
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,054
Why can't Ms. Heeyoung
tell us about your job?

1205
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:07,897
She has tattoos on her hands.

1206
00:56:07,922 --> 00:56:09,908
Her navel is pierced too.

1207
00:56:10,655 --> 00:56:11,822
What the heck?

1208
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:14,225
A tattoo artist.

1209
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,819
Something cool.

1210
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,389
A piercer.

1211
00:56:18,414 --> 00:56:19,901
Or an idol.

1212
00:56:20,922 --> 00:56:23,480
I have no idea. The mystery
makes me even more curious.

1213
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:25,615
That's right.

1214
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,686
- Maybe a beautician.
- No.

1215
00:56:27,711 --> 00:56:29,580
You said you worked during long holidays.

1216
00:56:29,605 --> 00:56:32,123
You work at night too.

1217
00:56:32,148 --> 00:56:33,452
(Curious)

1218
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:38,088
(Heeyoung's secret increases curiosity.)

1219
00:56:38,926 --> 00:56:43,097
(And what are the secrets
the other four girls keep?)

1220
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,100
Everyone looks really young.

1221
00:56:47,401 --> 00:56:49,326
I have a question.

1222
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,858
We all heard something.

1223
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:54,140
Is there anyone, like,
different from their image

1224
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:55,773
in your mind?

1225
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:57,617
Who's different?

1226
00:56:57,871 --> 00:56:59,587
- We didn't know their age.
- You and...

1227
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:01,188
- You and...
- Me?

1228
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,341
Well, Dagyo...

1229
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,810
She's very cute. It's...

1230
00:57:07,835 --> 00:57:09,428
- Really?
- Yes.

1231
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,515
Something like that.

1232
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,407
I've been calling her Dagyo.

1233
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:15,821
If she said she was born in 1992,

1234
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:17,111
- 1992?
- It would've been bad.

1235
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:19,023
I thought you were really young.

1236
00:57:19,048 --> 00:57:20,242
- That's why. Yes.
- Really?

1237
00:57:20,267 --> 00:57:23,632
I thought maybe 2000.1998 to 2002.

1238
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:25,952
2002? I've never been told that.

1239
00:57:26,165 --> 00:57:28,780
After the introductions,

1240
00:57:28,805 --> 00:57:32,045
I want to know Ms. Seoyeon better.

1241
00:57:32,594 --> 00:57:34,925
She doesn't seem to be straightforward.

1242
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,492
Right now, the number one in my heart

1243
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:38,883
is Ms. Dagyo.

1244
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:42,054
Ms. Dagyo, 70.

1245
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,059
Jinah, 30.

1246
00:57:45,018 --> 00:57:47,629
I now feel more drawn
to Ms. Mirang and Ms. Heeyoung.

1247
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,466
Even though I don't know Ms. Heeyoung's job

1248
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,004
and Ms. Mirang's job is very unexpected.

1249
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:53,179
How is this happening?

1250
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,683
Oh, actually,

1251
00:57:57,465 --> 00:57:59,293
the two of us know each other.

1252
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:01,698
(Everyone but Mirang and Minwoo knows.)
We all know that.

1253
00:58:01,723 --> 00:58:04,827
Yeah, that. So you guys
are probably wondering

1254
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,597
what we are to each other.

1255
00:58:09,976 --> 00:58:10,996
We're...

1256
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:13,519
We're like siblings.

1257
00:58:13,544 --> 00:58:16,173
We never had that kind of relationship.

1258
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:19,206
- We've only...
- We're friends.

1259
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:21,112
Ever been friends.

1260
00:58:21,223 --> 00:58:23,136
There's nothing at all.

1261
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:24,669
We're really just friends.

1262
00:58:24,694 --> 00:58:27,403
I'm really curious about one thing.

1263
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:30,247
I used to think of myself as pansexual

1264
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:33,514
because I don't look at genders or careers.

1265
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:35,272
Genders, careers, families.

1266
00:58:35,297 --> 00:58:37,405
I don't care about
these three things at all.

1267
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,195
Now I want to get married,
so I want to date only women.

1268
00:58:42,021 --> 00:58:44,903
But when you get to know each other,

1269
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:47,489
if I date a man,

1270
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:51,818
there will be an urge
to get married automatically.

1271
00:58:52,068 --> 00:58:55,185
But with a girlfriend,
I have to ask about it first?

1272
00:58:55,558 --> 00:58:57,451
Do I have to persuade her?

1273
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,347
Or I must hide that even on social media?

1274
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,799
I want to know
everyone's opinion about marriage.

1275
00:59:03,824 --> 00:59:05,765
I want to have a wedding.

1276
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,471
Oh, a wedding.

1277
00:59:07,496 --> 00:59:12,230
I find that the steps
in preparing the love confirmation

1278
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,191
shows our responsibility
for the other person.

1279
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:18,194
I personally like money very much.

1280
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:19,331
Money?

1281
00:59:19,731 --> 00:59:20,905
Who doesn't like money?

1282
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,105
The reason I got more ambitious,

1283
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,425
one of my goals

1284
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,862
is marriage.

1285
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:29,034
I want to have a wedding as well.

1286
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,947
Yes, I want to have a wedding.

1287
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:33,939
- I think everyone does.
- I want a cool one.

1288
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:37,320
This is why I'm trying to make money.

1289
00:59:37,345 --> 00:59:38,658
It's like...

1290
00:59:40,002 --> 00:59:41,330
Very cool.

1291
00:59:42,272 --> 00:59:44,002
I think everyone has the same goal.

1292
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:45,661
- Really?
- Probably.

1293
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:48,250
I was wondering
if someone didn't want to get married.

1294
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:53,264
I came here to meet my future spouse.

1295
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:55,102
So I tried to sound them out.

1296
00:59:55,127 --> 00:59:58,770
If someone's right for me
and thinks the same thing,

1297
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,245
they will value this concept, right?

1298
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,441
They might score 15 more points with me.

1299
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,271
So I brought it up on purpose.

1300
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:14,529
(It's time to send love letters
to the heart room)

1301
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,485
(The love letter topic
that shocks everyone)

1302
01:00:28,354 --> 01:00:31,369
(Letters written
after careful consideration)

1303
01:00:32,643 --> 01:00:34,362
I probably won't get any

1304
01:00:34,752 --> 01:00:36,127
because I didn't the last time.

1305
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:39,166
Because that's really from my heart.

1306
01:00:39,558 --> 01:00:41,455
It's just not clear at all.

1307
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,882
I was very happy during the date.

1308
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:45,921
(Increasingly entangled love threads)

1309
01:00:47,913 --> 01:00:51,983
(Who are their hearts about to go to?)
