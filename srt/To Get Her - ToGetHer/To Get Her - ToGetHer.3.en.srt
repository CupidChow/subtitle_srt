1
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,566
Oh, did something arrive?

2
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:44,704
(A message is sent to them again)

3
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:47,787
(Time to send a love letter)
Huh, again? Again?

4
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:52,358
(Time to send your feelings)

5
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:56,247
(Second love message)

6
00:00:57,944 --> 00:01:00,944
(Where are the girls' hearts going?)

7
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:09,735
(A love message sent to the ‘one person
you’re most curious about right now’)

8
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,127
(Anonymously send a love letter to 'the
person you are most curious of right now')

9
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:12,979
(If you send it to someone,
please write "To_______".)

10
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:14,343
(Jinah)
The person I'm most

11
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:16,048
curious of right now.

12
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,478
Haa...

13
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,014
(Dagyo)
I'm someone who overthinks.

14
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,851
I take a long time editing and thinking.

15
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:28,241
Because I have to write it down

16
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:29,802
on paper and send it right away

17
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:30,932
Because I have to write it

18
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:31,918
down immediately.

19
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:33,506
So I think it's a bit of a shame that

20
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:35,046
I couldn't express everything.

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,501
(Hangyeol)
The recipient’s feelings,

22
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:40,922
that’s not really something I can write.

23
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:42,113
And it's not something

24
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:43,386
I can predict either.

25
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,835
So I decided write and be honest

26
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,491
about how I feel right now,

27
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,698
and say what I want to say,

28
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:51,666
and express what I want to convey.

29
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,371
That was the biggest thing.

30
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:56,438
(Mirang)
Even now it’s still unclear,

31
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:58,327
but I think things should be different.

32
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:01,672
(Seoyeon)
It's not like a first impression vote.

33
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:03,938
At dinner, we talked a bit,

34
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:06,119
so I chose someone we had

35
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:07,944
a lot in common with.

36
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,588
The one who, once I saw the bright side,

37
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,002
made me want to get to know her better.

38
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:13,309
I will look at that personality first

39
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:14,682
and then choose.

40
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,873
(Thinking hard)

41
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,203
(Heeyoung)
Even just writing this might

42
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:23,239
feel burdensome for the other person.

43
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,918
I thought hard about this,

44
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:27,409
I have to write to someone else, right?

45
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,755
(Jinah)
What I want to know?

46
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,903
(A moment of thinking harder than
when they first wrote the letter)

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,901
(&lt;Love letter&gt;
that must be done carefully))

48
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:44,356
(Will their hearts tremble?)

49
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:48,412
You told me to fix my hair. Oh.

50
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,338
It's so hectic.

51
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,260
There's a message.

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,402
Me?

53
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:55,963
- Everyone.
- It should be everyone now.

54
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,489
(&lt;Love letter&gt; has arrived
You can check your inbox)

55
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,687
Ah.

56
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:11,131
- Again?
- I don’t really want to know.

57
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:13,492
Haa...

58
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:17,994
(Together Park Dagyo)

59
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,158
(To Dagyo IU - Peach)

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,595
Rather than writing each word,

61
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:38,685
please think of the lyrics to this song.

62
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,166
I want to say,

63
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:43,573
‘That’s my impression of you.’

64
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,074
So I wrote the song title down.

65
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,482
Huh? What?

66
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:55,561
(Another love letter to Dagyo)

67
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,652
To Dagyo,

68
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,084
You look beautiful when you cry.

69
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:00,085
I like it.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,988
I want to get to know you more.

71
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:06,485
(Dagyo who received two love letters)

72
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,499
One of them is Hangyeol,

73
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,179
and the other is Mirang, I think.

74
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:14,913
They came to my room after dinner.

75
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:16,321
It was cold,

76
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:19,341
so they both offered to lend me clothes.

77
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:20,561
They each went to get

78
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:21,890
something from their rooms.

79
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:24,554
But Mirang was a bit faster.

80
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,086
So I ended up wearing Mirang’s clothes.

81
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:28,768
Seeing that, it made me think,

82
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,468
maybe it's Mirang?

83
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:38,359
(Mirang who didn't
receive the first impression letter)

84
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,248
Huh?

85
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:47,411
(Finally, a love letter was
sent to Mirang)

86
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,673
Dear Mirang, you see,

87
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:05,650
if the two of us could talk privately,

88
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,151
we’d really be able to get to

89
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,104
know each other better, hehe.

90
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,710
(Thinking)

91
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,509
(Shocked)

92
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,565
(Glance)

93
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,721
Oh!

94
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,021
Ha, ha, ha. Huh?

95
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,486
- Oh.
- Do you know who?

96
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,107
- Huh?
- Do you know who it is?

97
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:40,773
Huh?

98
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:44,053
Do I know?

99
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:47,827
That drawing is of the suitcase, right?

100
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:49,535
Huh?

101
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:54,807
Oh, maybe not?

102
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,226
Ha, ha. Geez. I don’t know.

103
00:05:58,353 --> 00:05:59,605
I really have no idea.

104
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,992
(Unsure)

105
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,353
I really don't know.

106
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:08,363
Seoyeon’s suitcase...

107
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,286
it’s blue and pink.

108
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,670
She drew it on the letter.

109
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,686
So I thought it was Seoyeon,

110
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:19,176
but Seoyeon seemed clueless.

111
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,888
But honestly, I don’t know

112
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:22,255
who it is either.

113
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:26,564
(Mirang opens it again)

114
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,950
Do you know why I've been

115
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:29,447
reading since a while ago?

116
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:31,132
The reason I keep opening it...

117
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:34,576
- You just keep looking.
- Right? Right?

118
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,215
Even though I was in a good mood when

119
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:37,701
I received the letter,

120
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:39,089
but the content inside

121
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,770
made me feel even better.

122
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:44,446
The message was witty.

123
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:48,037
The suitcase drawing clever and cute,

124
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,656
(Love letter to Mirang...)

125
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:50,694
What I am curious about

126
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:51,787
the most right now...

127
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:57,328
(Thinking)
I wonder...

128
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,437
If it had said

129
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,671
“according to my impression,”

130
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:01,932
I would’ve written Heeyoung.

131
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:04,499
But since it said “a curious,”

132
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,379
And Mirang knows me well.

133
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,969
But as Jinah the girlfriend,

134
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,336
it seems like she talked more.

135
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,493
Even if she didn’t know me well,

136
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,711
Seoyeon will talk about Mirang

137
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,501
with a lot of interest.

138
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:23,226
"I felt there was something I wanted to

139
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:25,480
understand about someone

140
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:27,331
as unique as Mirang.

141
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:28,633
That’s why I originally wrote,

142
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,236
“For various reasons, I’m curious,”

143
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:31,461
but it felt too ambiguous,

144
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:33,101
so I ended up erasing it.

145
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,825
(A love letter was also sent to Jinah?)

146
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,134
(Two love letters sent to Jinah)

147
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,456
To Jinah, I have a lot

148
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,097
of things I was curious about.

149
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:53,801
Let's find the answer to the questions

150
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,624
that still remains unanswered today.

151
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,414
To Jinah,

152
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,665
I’m curious whether you were excited for

153
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:00,826
the person you went on

154
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:01,998
a date with today.

155
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:04,639
When we played the question game,

156
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:08,858
when our eyes met briefly,

157
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,345
I thought I’d like to go

158
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:11,751
on a date with you, Jinah.

159
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,715
I wanted to have a

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,066
one-on-one conversation with you.

161
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:19,657
One person I can guess,

162
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:20,981
and the other, I can’t.

163
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,244
I drew flowers in the letter

164
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:23,938
I sent to Heeyoung.

165
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,443
So I figured it was Heeyoung.

166
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,593
But the other one,

167
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,928
I really have no idea who it is.

168
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:31,291
She wrote it in blue.

169
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,117
But Mirang should know I like pink.

170
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:35,595
She definitely knows that.

171
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:38,244
That’s why I’m unsure.

172
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:41,879
(Will there be a love letter sent to
Heeyoung who is dating Jinah?)

173
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,940
(Heeyoung who received
three first impression letters)

174
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:56,218
(No love letter sent to Heeyoung)

175
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:02,253
Going on a date probably

176
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,074
becomes something official.

177
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,740
How can I write to you?

178
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:07,761
I already know that

179
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,108
it's a definite result.

180
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,986
(The moment of feeling free and sadness)
Because there's none,

181
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,781
I feel free and sad

182
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,862
(The moment of feeling free and sadness)
and at the same time.

183
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:17,800
I think it's because this is curiosity,

184
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,196
which is different from liking.

185
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:23,096
But in the end, I didn't send it.

186
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,160
I felt really heartbroken.

187
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,345
So while opening that anonymous note,

188
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:29,869
I realized I did have romantic feelings.

189
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,552
The fact that I didn’t send one

190
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,603
to that person, I felt bothered.

191
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:38,172
(What about Seoyeon who sent
the first impress letter to Heeyoung?)

192
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,977
(Together Kim Seoyeon)

193
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:45,264
(No love letter sent to Seoyeon)

194
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:58,445
I couldn't pick up on signals

195
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,804
from someone who liked me.

196
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,922
I didn’t really have any expectation.

197
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:04,092
The first time I received it,

198
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:05,214
I was quite surprised.

199
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,089
But the second time,

200
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,529
I didn’t really think much of it.

201
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:16,165
(What about Hangyeol who didn't
receive the first impression letter?)

202
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,159
(Surprised)

203
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:23,127
(Two love letters to Hangyeol)

204
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:30,883
To Hangyeol, thank you for expressing

205
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:33,170
your feelings a lot this evening.

206
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,732
Since it’s the first day,

207
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,872
we didn’t get to talk that much,

208
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:39,820
I'm writing this with the feeling that

209
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:41,191
let's openly expresses feelings

210
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:43,008
to someone who has feelings toward me.

211
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,165
Just the handwriting.

212
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:50,284
I can't tell from just the handwriting.

213
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:51,629
Suddenly, I started thinking

214
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:53,216
that I feel like I gave out too many

215
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,616
compliments to too many people.

216
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:56,819
When I got the letters,

217
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,539
I started getting confused

218
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:00,284
then regretted if it was wasted on me.

219
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,000
Ah, I should just go straight for

220
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,000
the person I'm aiming for.

221
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:10,647
(Their minds are getting more
and more confused)

222
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,762
Ah, I really don't know who.

223
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,431
I really don't know.

224
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,266
I didn’t get one this time.

225
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:22,673
- Huh?
- I didn’t get a letter this time.

226
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:24,847
(Startled)

227
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,500
Ah, but we don't know.

228
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,134
It is always changing.

229
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:30,173
- Right?
- Yeah, it's always changing.

230
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:32,436
And the letters...

231
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:33,487
It feels like it's coming

232
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:34,783
and then it doesn't.

233
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,829
And then it comes and then it doesn't.

234
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:39,202
Just think of it as

235
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,149
an invoice that flew in.

236
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:45,225
Take it easy.

237
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:48,527
But Seoyeon, today...

238
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,555
Earlier, while talking

239
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,182
about this and that...

240
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,079
You seemed to have

241
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:56,028
a lot on your mind and seemed quiet.

242
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:59,170
So now everyone else is confused too.

243
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:00,604
And maybe they thought

244
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:02,171
“she’s not interested in me?"

245
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,537
Perhaps.

246
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:08,368
But I'm not that, really. It was just...

247
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,058
My personality.

248
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,426
So I think I came here

249
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:16,756
with so much determination.

250
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,153
Or because I came with determination,

251
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:21,511
if I'm too impatient,

252
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:23,336
nothing will go as planned.

253
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:26,128
Slowly. Let’s take it slow.

254
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:30,100
I really like people who are cute.

255
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:33,365
With a mature and confident attitude.

256
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,950
But the confident and mature demeanor

257
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,583
has a cuteness reflected at the base.

258
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,244
But also a bit of goofiness too.

259
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,523
But when I tremble,

260
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:41,788
then, suddenly, they would

261
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,190
catch me or hold me.

262
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,835
So at that moment,

263
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,082
I think something inside me

264
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:48,325
cracked open a little.

265
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,349
I seem to fall in love easily.

266
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:55,355
How are we going to sleep?

267
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,729
If she comes, I'll have to ask.

268
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,944
I'll follow both of your opinions.

269
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:03,921
But it's not that much.

270
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,903
So I'm okay with being in

271
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,943
a relationship with both of them.

272
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:10,521
- Staying with just the three of us.
- Even if we went on a date today,

273
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,221
it's still just the beginning.

274
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:14,181
Both of us might not want to go.

275
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,455
But the mood can push things

276
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:16,492
in that direction, right?

277
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:18,704
- Do you get it?
- You're right.

278
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:21,651
We still don't know.

279
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,776
If it feels like things are

280
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,901
being rushed too much,

281
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:26,140
it'll start to feel
uncomfortable and anxious.

282
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:28,123
The other person might
feel the same way.

283
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,407
But in this kind of situation,

284
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,667
it would be too much if

285
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,372
we end up sharing a bed.

286
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:35,106
And it's not just one day.

287
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:39,911
(Heeyoung is thinking hard.)

288
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:41,908
I just came back from

289
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,403
being alone with her,

290
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:44,668
And I haven’t even talked to

291
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:45,995
the other participants yet.

292
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:49,339
I don't know what will happen now.

293
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,521
Because today there're many limitations.

294
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,122
I couldn’t really satisfy my curiosity.

295
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:55,288
I’m still curious about a lot of things.

296
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:59,072
Now I want to be a little more careful.

297
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,110
But I feel like I don’t

298
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,518
even have the option.

299
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:04,282
Yeah, we arrived really late,

300
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:07,206
and we only played one game.

301
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:10,930
Then what should we do about the bed?

302
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,370
- What do we do with the bed?
- Right. What should we do?

303
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:15,018
I knew the relationship

304
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:16,558
would turn out like this.

305
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:21,229
Is this really where people sleep?

306
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:24,556
I really don't know.

307
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,765
The first night when everyone was

308
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:28,232
lost in their own thoughts.

309
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:30,222
Didn't something happen

310
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,302
when I went outside?

311
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:34,953
Can you tell me about it?

312
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,474
We talked about that kind of thing

313
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,099
while we were eating.

314
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:39,253
If we could vote for

315
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,888
the first impressions again,

316
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:41,998
is there anyone who

317
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,705
would change their mind?

318
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,125
That's what we talked about.

319
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,254
But if you ask me how I feel,

320
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,197
that's a very dangerous question for me.

321
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,845
I will sway

322
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:58,920
to the words of the person I like.

323
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:02,119
The more I like someone,

324
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,512
I think I'll inevitably

325
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:04,977
be quiet at first.

326
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:09,097
Because I want them to like me back.

327
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:11,165
So if I said,

328
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,066
‘My first impression has changed’

329
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:18,218
and the person I like heard it,

330
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:19,522
they’d probably leave.

331
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,329
I overthink things unnecessarily.

332
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,967
But changing your mind

333
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,556
like that in the beginning

334
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,424
is better, I think.

335
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,466
I can understand that,

336
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,241
it's natural.

337
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,388
It's better than changing

338
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:34,568
your mind later?

339
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:36,185
Now, after both of you

340
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,581
have collected stories...

341
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,032
After listening to all of them,

342
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:40,257
is it not okay?

343
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:42,366
More importantly,

344
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,790
this is important, isn't it?

345
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:44,881
But being overconfident

346
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,363
from the beginning, honestly,

347
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:47,865
I think there's a bit of a problem,

348
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,065
like 'What do you know?'

349
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,202
That kind of thing...

350
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,007
That's it. There's a difference in

351
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,164
the boiling point temperatures.

352
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,677
Really, so I am like that?

353
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:00,373
So yes, I do understand.

354
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,500
I fully grasp the feelings.

355
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,053
It’s just right now, I’m not okay

356
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:05,878
with what’s being revealed.

357
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:09,486
I just feel like it's a word

358
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,761
that doesn't need to be said.

359
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,762
- Of course.
- But speaking about it

360
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,578
in public,

361
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:17,840
even if the chosen person is chosen,

362
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:20,170
they may feel sad.

363
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:22,124
My feeling starts with half of

364
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,749
my first impression.

365
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:24,803
That feeling.

366
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,556
Yes, that's the feeling.

367
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,299
Actually, about first impression...

368
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,233
We can be impressed by many people.

369
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:34,572
Yes, I was impressed by many people.

370
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,421
- Really?
- Yes, so I understand.

371
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,386
I guess it's because I don't know,

372
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:40,608
but I'm not like that.

373
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,246
- Just one person?
- Yes.

374
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:44,902
It's not like I'm looking at

375
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,749
just this one person.

376
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,561
This person can just stays still,

377
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,764
but I won't be able to see anyone else.

378
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,554
That's amazing.

379
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,297
Telling me to look at someone else...

380
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,585
Even if I look at other people,

381
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,546
I cannot see them.

382
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:07,614
But won't it change in the future?

383
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,922
This is probably my nature

384
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,405
because there's a time limit,

385
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:11,673
so it can't be helped.

386
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,648
If we try to connect,

387
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,668
some people might crave deeper bonds

388
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,306
but they’d have to let that go, right?

389
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:21,810
But there are seven days.

390
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,144
I feel a bit sad.

391
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:27,573
I kept wondering how we got here.

392
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,881
Conversations like these...

393
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:32,974
Already wanting to know others?

394
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,816
These thoughts wouldn’t leave me alone.

395
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,153
Maybe I read things wrong.

396
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,440
But it still hurts.

397
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,590
I think at first,

398
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,378
there were others who thought

399
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,396
the same way I thought,

400
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,988
- so it became a competition.
- Exactly.

401
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:50,682
- Now I've learned a lot.
- I think it's like that.

402
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:52,746
Right now, it hit me,

403
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,810
even if I wouldn’t act that way,

404
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,357
others might.

405
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:58,412
That helped me understand things better.

406
00:17:58,498 --> 00:17:59,608
- Once I saw it that way,

407
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:00,803
- everything felt okay.
- Yeah.

408
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,900
Of course it can be done.

409
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,878
As we got to know each other more,

410
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,804
I started wondering

411
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,932
would this connection grow stronger?

412
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,185
That's what really matters in the end.

413
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:23,618
(The first day of Together House, the night
they got to know each other a little better)

414
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:30,357
(Together House
Welcome the new day)

415
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,735
- I'm sorry.
- No. Stop.

416
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:38,182
No?

417
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,256
Bare natural face.

418
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:43,379
Have you eaten yet? Have you?

419
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,989
Me? I don't know.

420
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,440
Seems like she has eaten a bit.

421
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:48,707
I saw some ingredients,

422
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,462
so I thought I'd cook something.

423
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:52,983
- That's extraordinary.
- Really?

424
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,652
So funny.

425
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:03,890
I was really rude.

426
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:07,568
What's there to eat?

427
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:10,101
But all I can do is breakfast again.

428
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:12,696
But this bread without butter is...

429
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:15,523
Oh, there's eggs, bacon, and bread.

430
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:18,349
- There's a jam, a jam.
- There's also a jam.

431
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,799
Yesterday I went out on a date

432
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,797
so I didn't eat much.

433
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:24,803
Because I was so excited.

434
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,442
I usually don't eat breakfast.

435
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:27,603
But today I think

436
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:29,308
I should eat breakfast.

437
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,279
Since I'm cooking it anyway,

438
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,996
I'll try using what we have to cook.

439
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:38,692
What is this chemistry between the two?

440
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,353
(Supplements)

441
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,458
(Mirang is interested in supplements)

442
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:48,700
(Liposomes (Glutathione?))

443
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,652
What is Glutathione good for?

444
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:52,825
Glutathione is an antioxidant.

445
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,335
And helps whiten skin.

446
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:56,089
- Whitening skin?
- Yes.

447
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,407
Good for nourishing the skin

448
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:58,951
and preventing aging.

449
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:00,798
And helps with hangovers.

450
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:02,843
(Jinah explains its properties fluently)

451
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:05,064
Isn't this an advertisement?

452
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,017
- Are you advertising?
- No.

453
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:09,978
Because I'm eating it too.

454
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,305
Eliminate the bad smell

455
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,245
that's characteristic of enzymes.

456
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:22,050
(Purple enzyme, smooth)

457
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,023
Mmm, this one is delicious.

458
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,517
If you eat something and go ‘mm, ’

459
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,186
it means it’s delicious, right?

460
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,524
The one earlier?

461
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,598
Heeyoung, this one is delicious.

462
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:38,158
(Purple enzyme, smooth)

463
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,886
You have to eat these slowly.

464
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:46,244
(Start your day strong
with purple enzyme)

465
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:49,594
Is this delicious too?

466
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,309
(Jinah brings glutathione
(liposomes))

467
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:52,921
Isn't that too much?

468
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,748
The one I used to eat...

469
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,535
I have to start eating some.

470
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,363
(Dagyo prepares for a new day
of Together House)

471
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:17,761
(The vibe is different from yesterday.
(More meticulous)

472
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:27,131
(Who came?)

473
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,812
(Smile)
- You're here? - Yes.

474
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,097
Who's here?

475
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:32,709
Dagyo, you're dressed so beautifully.

476
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,387
It's quite cold outside today.

477
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,479
Outside? Sure.

478
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,585
That's why I dressed warmly.

479
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,485
The first thing I saw

480
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,121
this morning was Dagyo.

481
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:46,266
The dress she wore today was so pretty.

482
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:48,683
(Heh)

483
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:51,531
I heard you stayed up late last night.

484
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,630
What time?
Why did you stay up late?

485
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,899
- Half past four in the morning.
- Half past four in the morning?

486
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,318
I was just chatting with Seoyeon.

487
00:21:57,406 --> 00:22:00,024
You two must really get along.

488
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:03,272
- We were consulting each other.
- Consulting?

489
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:04,833
It's only the first night, but you two

490
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:06,213
were consulting until 4 am?

491
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,919
Try asking Mirang.

492
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:13,568
By the way,

493
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:14,607
who sets the breakfast shift?

494
00:22:14,631 --> 00:22:17,742
I don't know. Whoever wakes up first.

495
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:20,520
Thank you for starting it.

496
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,645
(Breakfast led by Heeyoung)

497
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,978
So I took a picture with my dad.

498
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:25,271
I'm still wondering now.

499
00:22:31,596 --> 00:22:33,340
Mmm, it's delicious.

500
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,465
- Delicious?
- Mmm.

501
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,197
It's delicious.

502
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:49,500
Do you know who's dating who today?

503
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,225
I don't know. No one knows.

504
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:53,241
Who's going on a date with who?

505
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:54,621
And what kind of date?

506
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,948
I think someone will come today.

507
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:59,552
Megi might come.

508
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:00,836
After we get back from the date,

509
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:01,797
Megi might come.

510
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:03,702
- Really?
- One person will be left behind.

511
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:06,423
- One person will be left behind.
- Because we are odd numbers?

512
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,758
I'm not the type to

513
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,979
get close when I like someone.

514
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,974
I'm actually the type to pull away.

515
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:22,368
I just want to see this person's true,

516
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:23,821
unfiltered self.

517
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,315
I don't want to fake interest

518
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,161
from the beginning.

519
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:30,647
Have you chosen a date

520
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:31,611
with someone today?

521
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:34,747
- Choosing with your heart?
- No, feelings.

522
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:35,748
Haven't decided yet?

523
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:37,623
Have you chosen yet?

524
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,819
Mm, there's someone I want

525
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,853
to go on a date with.

526
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:45,326
I don't know.

527
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:48,305
Are characteristics important?

528
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:49,769
Characteristics?

529
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,790
It's not important.

530
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,467
But the first time I asked them,

531
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,382
they said it's not important.

532
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:56,421
But I'm the same.

533
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:58,799
But I don’t know. It’s too difficult.

534
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,717
Yesterday was difficult, today too.

535
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,511
If I had to choose now,

536
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:05,651
to be honest, who would I choose...

537
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,388
- Like...
- There’s no one that pops into mind?

538
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:13,411
No, there is. I'm a bit troubled.

539
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:15,560
Because I want to know

540
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:17,546
who I want to get to know first.

541
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:19,072
I can’t say it’s just one person.

542
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:20,950
It's not like that.

543
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:22,344
Not just one person for me too.

544
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:24,255
Exactly. Right.

545
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:27,521
Would Seoyeon ask this kind of question

546
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,359
to someone she’s not interested in?

547
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,581
I can’t tell if all women

548
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:33,095
are just being nice to me,

549
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,045
or actually flirting.

550
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:38,983
For me, this is such a rare opportunity

551
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,390
that came with difficulty.

552
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:44,383
Dagyo is the target

553
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:47,081
that I worry about the most.

554
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:49,470
(Seoyeon comes to Mirang who
is preparing after breakfast)

555
00:24:49,494 --> 00:24:50,669
If you can choose a date,

556
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:52,374
would you go on a date?

557
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,446
- Yes, I'd like to try.
- With number 1?

558
00:24:57,447 --> 00:25:00,670
Number 1. But I really don't know.

559
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:02,124
I will choose this person even if it

560
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:03,626
looks like this person will abandon me.

561
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,466
If there's a feeling for me.

562
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,878
I will choose this person even if it

563
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:07,991
looks like this person will abandon me.

564
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:10,158
But I seem to know. Me too.

565
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,463
The feeling that both of them

566
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,597
have is equal.

567
00:25:12,662 --> 00:25:15,669
That person is really my type.

568
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,102
I don't know about this one.

569
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:20,670
Because everyone has different charms.

570
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:24,517
First of all, I want to date Dagyo.

571
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:26,807
First of all, Dagyo.

572
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:29,204
Dagyo?

573
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:30,539
Was it Dagyo from the beginning?

574
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,921
- The first time was Heeyoung.
- It was Heeyoung. Right.

575
00:25:34,287 --> 00:25:36,325
But yesterday,

576
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,566
after watching them go on a date,

577
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,755
It didn’t feel so exciting anymore.

578
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:43,667
And then during dinner,

579
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,664
I talked a lot with Dagyo.

580
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:48,460
We have many things in common.

581
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:51,233
- Yesterday?
- Mm.

582
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:54,478
Ah, this is hard.

583
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,774
(Who is the person
Mirang is interested in?)

584
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,715
(Strong from the base to make
one look more beautiful)

585
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,324
(Gel sheet filled with
moisturizing essence)

586
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:17,981
(Mirang is getting more beautiful)

587
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:21,598
(Moist)

588
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:29,226
(Smooth, firmly attached)

589
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:45,300
(Morning urgent skincare is done)

590
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:56,774
(Mirang comes out with moist cheeks)

591
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:57,937
Oh!

592
00:26:57,938 --> 00:26:59,602
(Stares)

593
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,151
(Pops)
Walking out with a slap on the cheeks.

594
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,572
Gosh, so cute.

595
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:03,896
No, it's unique.

596
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:06,314
She's doing this so coldly.

597
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:07,583
You'll have a nice makeup today.

598
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:10,660
If I smile, it'll fall.

599
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,157
(Shy)

600
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:15,538
- Coldly.
- Yeah.

601
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,855
(Coldly)

602
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:19,210
Oh, she's shy.

603
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:22,648
Embarrassed about skincare.

604
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,882
Then first, let's choose

605
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:27,008
who will cook dinner tonight.

606
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:33,019
Perfect timing.

607
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:34,956
Please decide two people for

608
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:37,208
tonight’s dinner as a game of chance.

609
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:38,672
Feel free to choose any game.

610
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:39,880
A game?

611
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:41,649
How about deciding
with the crocodile game?

612
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:43,838
That's great. That game is fast.

613
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:46,123
Then how should we decide the order?

614
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,013
The order?

615
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:48,591
Last is the worst spot.

616
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:49,802
Then shall we go by

617
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,240
the order of who woke up earliest?

618
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:53,715
- How’s that?
- Oh! Sounds good.

619
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,033
- Me.
- The diligent one gets to choose.

620
00:27:57,204 --> 00:28:00,138
(Starting with Heeyoung
who woke up first)

621
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,233
(Heeyoung passed)

622
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:03,537
Oh, I'm saved.

623
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,934
(Passed)

624
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,235
(Next Jinah's turn next)
We woke up at 4:00 AM for a bit.

625
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,540
No, really?

626
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:10,763
(Jinah passed)
That's right.

627
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:11,898
- Yes, because of the alarm clock.
- Maybe it'll hit this time.

628
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:13,153
I'm going to press it now.

629
00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:16,135
(Seoyeon also passed)
Oh, the sound is scary.

630
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:17,222
(Mirang passed)

631
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:18,704
(Next is Hangyeol)
So scary.

632
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:19,939
It takes time.

633
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:21,916
(Hangyeol is on duty to cook dinner)

634
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:24,403
- We have to choose another person.
- We have to play another round.

635
00:28:24,427 --> 00:28:25,762
- We have to play another round.
- No.

636
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:26,974
Just pick one.

637
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,129
- Yes, pick one.
- Yes.

638
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,985
- Won't that be too much pressure?
- Pick one is the best.

639
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:32,052
No, no.

640
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:33,144
- Pick one.
- No, no.

641
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,175
How about I do it?

642
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:35,791
I woke up late.

643
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:37,960
Do it with me.

644
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,368
Do it with me.

645
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,753
Do it with me.

646
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:44,306
- Do it?
- Mm.

647
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,661
Okay, okay.

648
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,217
- There's something that's confusing me.
- Oh, you want to talk about it?

649
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:57,859
- I'll listen first then talk.
- It's just...

650
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:00,168
I just thought...

651
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,444
Tell me, tell me.

652
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:02,751
Yesterday...

653
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:05,309
Was the first day.

654
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:06,844
So about sending letters,

655
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,931
to be honest,

656
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:10,158
there isn't someone

657
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,302
that I’m really that into.

658
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:15,005
But should I only send one to

659
00:29:15,006 --> 00:29:17,201
whoever shows interest in me first?

660
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:19,969
- Meanwhile, I’ve been giving signals.
- Was there such a person?

661
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,666
So now I’m telling you this,

662
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,505
Earlier, I mentioned this to Seoyeon.

663
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:24,744
But what confuses me

664
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:25,766
are her little actions.

665
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,061
"Is this flirting?"

666
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,310
It made me feel that way.

667
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:29,616
And is me thinking this way

668
00:29:29,623 --> 00:29:31,142
the real problem here?

669
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,318
That's anxiety.

670
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,223
I think I'm overthinking now. So...

671
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:37,422
- Overthinking?
- Yeah.

672
00:29:37,423 --> 00:29:38,933
But how do you even distinguish between

673
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,819
flirting and just being nice?

674
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,390
Yeah. That’s what’s so hard.

675
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:44,335
In here, I usually...

676
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,634
Usually,

677
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:48,425
when I meet someone,

678
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:51,033
‘She is someone who dates women.’

679
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:51,945
I can tell instantly.

680
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,003
Then we meet one-on-one.

681
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:55,445
- And we start with romantic intentions.
- Me too, me too.

682
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:57,079
So I’ve only dated

683
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:58,620
when it was already obvious that

684
00:29:58,644 --> 00:30:01,045
the person liked women like me.

685
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:02,252
In the situation where

686
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:03,873
we like each other,

687
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:05,778
whether it’s physical attraction or not,

688
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:06,808
these encounters

689
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:09,143
aren’t exactly natural.

690
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:11,961
Coming here is a special circumstance,

691
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:14,064
everyone likes girls here,

692
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:15,148
- Yeah, it's the first time.
- This is the first time.

693
00:30:15,152 --> 00:30:19,541
So right now, I can’t tell.

694
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:22,003
Is it just friendly affection

695
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:23,763
with good intentions?

696
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:24,983
The way she smiles at me,

697
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:26,246
touches me,

698
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:28,374
speaks to me or

699
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,481
does it mean something?

700
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:33,219
The things she said to me,

701
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,038
am I overthinking?

702
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,044
Maybe she’s just being considerate,

703
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:38,884
and I’m reading into

704
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:40,271
every little thing she says.

705
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,915
You're right.

706
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:44,865
- Perhaps you're right.
- Geez, is that so?

707
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,753
The person I’m worried about...

708
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,125
the one I actually want to date

709
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,739
and get to know...

710
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:52,336
well,

711
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:53,890
- originally there were two.
- Two?

712
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:55,714
I’ve been torn between them.

713
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,090
Taking care and receiving help

714
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:18,500
from each other should be okay?

715
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:19,652
That's true.

716
00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:25,725
Don't ignore the obvious truth.

717
00:31:25,726 --> 00:31:28,356
That's right. So...

718
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:32,603
That's the truth. You can't ignore this.

719
00:31:55,912 --> 00:32:01,114
(The appearance of a new woman)

720
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:09,695
Now, we can't talk freely.

721
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:11,207
Everyone is getting to know

722
00:32:11,232 --> 00:32:12,912
each other naturally.

723
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,685
That's not possible.

724
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:32,136
A bell rang as we chatted happily.

725
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:33,443
We should probably get going.

726
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:34,656
And then go downstairs.

727
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:38,908
What is it?

728
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:44,701
I opened the door, right? But...

729
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,291
Hello.

730
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,856
I thought she was so beautiful.

731
00:32:50,857 --> 00:32:52,313
I think I was really surprised.

732
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:55,332
Oh That's why it's Megi, isn't it?

733
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,915
Hello.

734
00:32:57,932 --> 00:33:00,327
The person I first met was very tall.

735
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,582
Quite...

736
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,788
A scary person has arrived.

737
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,243
I hadn’t seen anyone like that

738
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:06,308
until now.

739
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:12,326
Hello.

740
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:14,735
- Hello.
- Hello.

741
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:15,844
Firstly,

742
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:17,302
I was most curious about what kind

743
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:18,388
of people would be there.

744
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:21,635
And I felt really excited about

745
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:25,119
the things I could do anything there.

746
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,392
Nice to meet you.

747
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:31,609
- Another person with a bob.
- Ah, that's right.

748
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:32,839
Yes.

749
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:39,278
Please take a seat.

750
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,775
This is my phone.

751
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,637
Seriously...

752
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:47,406
(Distant)

753
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:50,592
(Careful, shy)

754
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:56,334
She's very tall and has a great figure.

755
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,286
Because of the arrogant vibe,

756
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,788
the atmosphere is different

757
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,297
from the people here.

758
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:03,020
- Why are you sitting there?
- Yesterday, Heeyoung was here.

759
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:05,562
- Let's go sit over there.
- I just came in yesterday.

760
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,446
This is Dagyo.

761
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,620
When Dagyo came in,

762
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:11,495
the two of us got super awkward.

763
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:12,773
It was like that.

764
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:14,192
But now we're in the same room.

765
00:34:14,193 --> 00:34:15,397
Oh, really?

766
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:18,011
There are three of us here.

767
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:19,883
Are the others here too?

768
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,538
Yes, they're in the next building.

769
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:22,974
- Dagyo, would you call for them?
- Alright.

770
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:24,368
- Such an exciting person?
- Yes.

771
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:25,837
- You probably couldn’t stay still. Go.
- Yeah.

772
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,342
I want to know the reaction.

773
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:28,671
My face is all red.

774
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:31,418
I'll be back soon.

775
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:34,375
My face is really red.

776
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,894
I imagined a lot of

777
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,359
shy moments like this.

778
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:38,466
But it was actually

779
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,424
such a comfortable atmosphere.

780
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:41,585
So to be honest,

781
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:42,787
I was a bit disappointed.

782
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:44,202
I was hoping they hadn’t

783
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,329
gotten close yet.

784
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:48,994
Did you finish getting ready?

785
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,073
Yes.

786
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:51,134
This is bad.

787
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:52,614
What happened? Why?

788
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:54,230
A new person appeared.

789
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,961
- What?
- Megi is here.

790
00:34:58,215 --> 00:34:59,894
(Totally curious about the new person)
You saw here? She came into the room?

791
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:01,215
I opened the door for her myself.

792
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,050
Let's go.

793
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:04,831
You're here.

794
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:06,095
- Is she pretty?
- Mm.

795
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:07,736
Are you asking if she’s pretty?

796
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:10,128
She probably is, why?

797
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,099
Why do you laugh when I ask if
she’s pretty?

798
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,257
You sound like an old man.

799
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:21,797
Hello.

800
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,244
Hello.

801
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,920
Why do you like, Mirang?

802
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:29,936
Why me?

803
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:31,258
Mirang.

804
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,196
Yeah, why do you like them?

805
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,564
Oh, you at your face.

806
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:36,435
Mirang's face is turning red.

807
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:42,598
(Unknown atmosphere
between Mirang and the new person)

808
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:45,275
Hello, I'm Son Minwoo.

809
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,100
- Son Minwoo?
- Son Minwoo.

810
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,007
- Son Minwoo. Son.
- Son. Son.

811
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,264
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

812
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,946
People often say

813
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,121
my first impression was cold,

814
00:35:59,122 --> 00:36:00,593
so it might be

815
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:02,340
difficult for me at first.

816
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:03,839
People think I won’t

817
00:36:03,866 --> 00:36:05,368
even respond to them.

818
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:07,510
It's actually very delicate.

819
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,659
I think having that kind of personality

820
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,016
is an advantage for me, as I can catch

821
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,962
my opponent quickly.

822
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,931
I like someone who I like.

823
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,594
If I don’t like someone,

824
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,637
even if you give me a hundred million,

825
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,439
I won't sit in a coffee shop with you

826
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,134
not even for a moment.

827
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,393
I get super jealous.

828
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,651
I'll keep him in my prison forever.

829
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,632
I don’t want to suffer because of love,

830
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:35,046
but I want to have a love that

831
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,740
embrace each other because of love.

832
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,895
I want to create a love

833
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,909
like the ones in dramas.

834
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:47,763
(Minwoo)

835
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:52,293
Shall we start the introductions?

836
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:54,692
I'm Park Dagyo.

837
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:56,097
Park Dagyo?

838
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,786
Yes. That's right.

839
00:36:57,787 --> 00:36:59,470
I'm Kim Jinah.

840
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:00,999
Kim Jinah?

841
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,655
- I'm Park Heeyoung.
- Park Heeyoung.

842
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,827
I'm Kim Seoyeon.

843
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:07,583
Kim Seoyeon.

844
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,503
I'm Jeong Hangyeol.

845
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,802
Jeong Hangyeol?

846
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:15,896
Why are you laughing?

847
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,775
Kim Mirang.

848
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:19,069
Kim Mirang?

849
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:20,705
Yes, Kim Mirang.

850
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:23,145
You seem to be very shy.

851
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,208
No.

852
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:28,439
I...

853
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,818
I'm the one who came in the middle

854
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:33,523
because someone left.

855
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:40,537
Please go get ready, Hangyeol.

856
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,597
Please go get ready, Hangyeol.

857
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:44,341
Me?

858
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:46,194
You should go prepare for a date.

859
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,297
Oh, you startled me.

860
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:51,518
I thought I was going to be eliminated.

861
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,577
I thought it was a survival show.

862
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,966
- Wow, I was so shocked.
- Squid Game?

863
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,806
I want to know

864
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:00,860
the selection standards too.

865
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:06,507
(Minwoo received a mission earlier)

866
00:38:06,713 --> 00:38:08,433
(Search for true love,
welcome to Together House)

867
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:10,268
(Invite the person you like
the most on a date 1:1)

868
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:12,649
(From the 7 people who
entered Together House)

869
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,460
I can choose in three seconds.

870
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,352
Hangyeol she...

871
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:17,484
had this aura that really

872
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,936
stood out on her own.

873
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,543
And her eyes were really pretty.

874
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:24,864
Especially when she blinked

875
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,089
from the side.

876
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:32,900
(Hangyeol is rushing to
prepare for the date)

877
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:38,209
(Date pairing 1:1 Minwoo and
Hangyeol is done)

878
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:39,751
How nice.

879
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,068
Are you done preparing?

880
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:45,538
- Yes.
- It's cold, you know?

881
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,099
- Will you be okay?
- Yes, I'll be okay.

882
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:49,390
Then the rest of you...

883
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:54,092
I have a gift for the rest of you.

884
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:55,949
I like it very much!

885
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:58,254
- Such a good person!
- A gift!

886
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,263
Here, take it.

887
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:01,960
Oh, just me?

888
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,797
- Let’s go.
- Going to get married?

889
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,430
It's like you're going to get married.

890
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:08,785
Take care.

891
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:09,739
Safe travels.

892
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,117
Have fun on your date!

893
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:26,577
- Please get in the car.
- Here?

894
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,404
Are you cold?

895
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,192
(Minwoo & Hangyeol
go on their first date)

896
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:39,459
Road No. 1.

897
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,236
(Minwoo & Hangyeol
go on their first date)

898
00:39:42,852 --> 00:39:44,260
Are you wearing your seat belt?

899
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:46,156
- Yes, I'm wearing it.
- So you know.

900
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:48,301
I got it.

901
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:55,152
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

902
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:56,941
(Shy)

903
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:06,111
Hail or rain?

904
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,270
Is it hail?

905
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:11,630
Hail will fall harder, won't it?

906
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:13,326
That's right.

907
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:14,978
Rain.

908
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,315
This is the first time

909
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:19,868
I've seen snow fall in Jeju.

910
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:21,053
Me too.

911
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,084
This is the first time I've ever seen

912
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:28,579
such thick snow flying like this.

913
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:32,640
But in Seoul, have you ever seen

914
00:40:32,902 --> 00:40:36,520
snow as heavy as the first snow?

915
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,254
Here, it feels more like

916
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:42,761
it's fluttering down gently.

917
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:46,595
I don’t think I’ll forget

918
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,700
the snow in Jeju Island.

919
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:59,416
After arriving on the first day,

920
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,027
we went straight on a drive.

921
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:03,195
That’s when it really hit me.

922
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,776
Like, “I’m really in Jeju,”

923
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:06,950
and “someone is beside me.”

924
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:18,010
(Can they create memories as
beautiful as Jeju Island's snow?)

925
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:20,720
Even though the sun is out,

926
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:21,767
it’s snowing.

927
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:23,894
What an amazing country.

928
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:30,102
But how did I end up coming along?

929
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:32,648
What kind of system was it?

930
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,989
- System?
- Yes.

931
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:37,328
Nothing like that, just feelings.

932
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:39,161
Choose from feelings.

933
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,282
When we first met?

934
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:45,257
The first time we met was
when we introduced ourselves.

935
00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:47,542
I didn't know who was who.

936
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:51,861
Your face is just my type.

937
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:54,677
I thought I was eliminated.

938
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,687
At that time,

939
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:57,326
I was like,

940
00:41:57,327 --> 00:41:59,112
“Okay, time to close the suitcase.”

941
00:41:59,113 --> 00:42:01,324
Until then, to be honest,

942
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:02,471
The letter I received

943
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:03,863
at dinner yesterday.

944
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:05,793
During the initial impression vote,

945
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:08,721
I didn’t get even one vote. So I...

946
00:42:08,722 --> 00:42:10,048
You didn't get a single vote

947
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:11,152
on the first vote?

948
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:12,587
I

949
00:42:12,588 --> 00:42:15,201
Went outside since

950
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:17,175
early yesterday morning.

951
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,347
While the others were getting close.

952
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:22,603
I couldn’t increase the intimacy much.

953
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:24,808
Because I was sleeping

954
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:26,701
and getting ready.

955
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,385
So you thought I was told
to leave the house

956
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:31,206
when I told you to come out?

957
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:32,628
Yes.

958
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,297
I thought I had to go.

959
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:37,935
But I was a little surprised

960
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,632
when you said you chose me.

961
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:43,796
I chose because I like you.

962
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:46,741
Really? What should I do?

963
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:49,333
Right now,

964
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,593
I don't know what to do.

965
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,810
What kind of people do you usually like?

966
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,544
- Me?
- Yes.

967
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:01,866
I like

968
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:03,357
people with sharp features,

969
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:05,910
ears, eyes, nose, and mouth.

970
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:08,899
And like people with single eyelids or

971
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:10,704
double eyelids that are hidden.

972
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:15,219
My eyes are a little hidden.

973
00:43:15,244 --> 00:43:18,518
You have a face

974
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,392
like an actor.

975
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:22,410
(Shy)
Oh, that's too much praise.

976
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:25,333
The atmosphere is the most pleasing...

977
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:28,194
to me.

978
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,982
Honestly, when I hear things like that,

979
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:36,340
I don’t really know how to respond.

980
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:39,124
Do as you wish.

981
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,442
I have to accept it.

982
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:43,805
But I'm freezing.

983
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:45,499
I don't know.

984
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:47,823
You can just be frozen.

985
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:50,181
Frozen just like that?

986
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:52,512
My insides were beating wildly.

987
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:56,752
My heart is beating so fast that

988
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:57,848
I'm surprised it can be

989
00:43:57,862 --> 00:43:59,108
beating this fast.

990
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:01,225
At first,

991
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:02,422
my first impression of her,

992
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,925
I thought that

993
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:05,493
she had an appearance of

994
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,251
someone I couldn't reach.

995
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:08,409
I think she

996
00:44:08,434 --> 00:44:10,088
has the exact opposite appearance to me.

997
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:11,892
She's very neat,

998
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:14,273
polite and proper.

999
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:15,354
So,

1000
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:17,368
when she said she picked me,

1001
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:18,742
I was honestly just shocked.

1002
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:20,707
It was like a refreshing jolt,

1003
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:22,229
isn't it?

1004
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:26,902
This should be

1005
00:44:26,903 --> 00:44:28,974
the coastal road.

1006
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,242
The coastal road.

1007
00:44:36,196 --> 00:44:38,141
Shall we take a look here?

1008
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:39,943
Whoa, that’s crazy.

1009
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:42,025
Whoa, so refreshing.

1010
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:45,821
(Minwoo and Hangyeol)
It’s really beautiful.

1011
00:44:45,822 --> 00:44:47,614
(Minwoo and Hangyeol are enjoying the
wide open Jeju sea together)

1012
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:48,670
That's right.

1013
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,010
I haven't seen the sea the same color

1014
00:44:52,043 --> 00:44:53,450
as the sky in a long time.

1015
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:55,406
Is that a stingray?

1016
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:56,577
Where?

1017
00:44:56,578 --> 00:45:00,554
I just saw a big black thing over there.

1018
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:03,488
Look at that.

1019
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:04,448
(Interested)

1020
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:05,674
I'm kidding.

1021
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:09,863
(Dejected)

1022
00:45:10,004 --> 00:45:12,454
I was seriously looking for it.

1023
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,393
But seriously, it’s pretty, right?

1024
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:15,894
I don't think I've seen

1025
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:17,360
the sea hitting the beach

1026
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:19,350
like this

1027
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,062
in a long time.

1028
00:45:21,063 --> 00:45:24,900
Even so, seeing the ocean again,

1029
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:28,051
it's great to see stingrays too.

1030
00:45:28,052 --> 00:45:29,702
I want to take a photo.

1031
00:45:29,703 --> 00:45:32,605
Me? Take a shot of me please.

1032
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,450
A shot with the ocean.

1033
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:37,871
(Snap)

1034
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:40,754
You could see how nervous she was.

1035
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,368
You could see she was kind of alarmed

1036
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:45,714
even though she was so pretty.

1037
00:45:45,715 --> 00:45:47,553
Why is her confidence so low?

1038
00:45:47,554 --> 00:45:49,500
I want to help her feel more confident.

1039
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:51,135
I think it's similar

1040
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,753
to that feeling.

1041
00:45:56,162 --> 00:45:58,722
The photo isn't the camera's fault.

1042
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:03,042
- So is it my fault?
- That's a stingray.

1043
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:04,452
Again?

1044
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:08,253
No, you keep fooling me.

1045
00:46:08,254 --> 00:46:11,450
You're really good at teasing me.

1046
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:14,273
(Snap, snap, snap)

1047
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:16,863
I'm satisfied.

1048
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:24,816
(After taking pictures for a while,
the two of them quietly admire the sea)

1049
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:30,777
- Because of you, I got to see the sea.
- Why?

1050
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:34,515
Thanks to you.

1051
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:39,973
That's basalt rock. Basalt rock.

1052
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,616
Did you know that Jeon Hyun Moo

1053
00:46:42,641 --> 00:46:44,708
is the one who made the basalt?

1054
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:46,679
Huh?

1055
00:46:48,324 --> 00:46:51,692
You seem to like to joke with me.

1056
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,417
But you’re still keeping

1057
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:55,583
your distance for now.

1058
00:46:56,635 --> 00:46:57,932
I'll tell you a lot of jokes

1059
00:46:57,952 --> 00:46:59,332
when we get back to the room.

1060
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:03,297
Isn’t it a bit tiring to understand.

1061
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:04,311
Try...

1062
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:07,764
I'm the type who’s not good

1063
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,471
at leading conversations.

1064
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:14,631
So I feeling a bit anxious in the car.

1065
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:17,289
Whether it was a bit that made me smile

1066
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:21,449
or a bit that made me laugh,

1067
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:24,243
I think I felt a little relieved

1068
00:47:24,268 --> 00:47:26,176
at that time.

1069
00:47:27,923 --> 00:47:29,784
Shall we go?

1070
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,450
I have a lot of questions I want to ask.

1071
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:47,493
Then go ahead. Maybe inside the car.

1072
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:52,692
I can answer better.

1073
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:54,758
Or when we look at
each other in the cafe.

1074
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:58,092
- I want to go ask at the cafe.
- Alright.

1075
00:48:01,406 --> 00:48:06,389
(The two drive and get to know each other)

1076
00:48:10,131 --> 00:48:13,727
(What questions does Minwoo
want to ask Hangyeol?)

1077
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,306
The windows here are high, huh?

1078
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:32,862
Very wide.

1079
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:36,204
(Hangyeol and Minwoo sit next to
each other, facing the wide open window)

1080
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,607
Thank you.

1081
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:42,897
I think you’re supposed to stir
this before eating.

1082
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:43,950
Feels like it.

1083
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:45,353
Yes, I got it.

1084
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:48,571
But both look tasty.

1085
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:50,528
Could this be something you slice up?

1086
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:52,376
Slicing while eating...

1087
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,344
I don’t have any preference.

1088
00:48:55,979 --> 00:48:58,093
This chewy texture…

1089
00:48:58,094 --> 00:48:59,970
I think it’s a croffle.

1090
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:02,876
You’re really good at cutting it.

1091
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:09,841
Try it.

1092
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:12,914
I'll eat this myself.

1093
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:16,271
- I'll eat this.
- Why?

1094
00:49:16,272 --> 00:49:18,017
Because I want to eat it.

1095
00:49:18,018 --> 00:49:20,677
(Joking)
I even cut it into big pieces.

1096
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:23,592
Why do you want to eat small pieces?

1097
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,532
Thank you.

1098
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,179
Since it was pre-cut,

1099
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,979
a lot of the cream had gotten messy.

1100
00:49:30,895 --> 00:49:32,818
Only said quietly.

1101
00:49:32,978 --> 00:49:35,254
I really want to tease her.

1102
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:37,018
She was eating in tiny bites.

1103
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:38,889
That's really cute.

1104
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:41,880
(Cute)

1105
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:45,228
But...

1106
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:49,445
I made a choice in just three minutes

1107
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,325
after walking in.

1108
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,425
So I think you might have been confused.

1109
00:49:57,485 --> 00:50:02,524
But I don't know your type, Hangyeol.

1110
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:06,471
What is your type?

1111
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,812
Even if not in detail,

1112
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:12,131
just broadly is okay.

1113
00:50:12,132 --> 00:50:14,870
Honestly, for me, the basics are

1114
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:17,064
I'm usually attracted by

1115
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:18,816
the innocent style first,

1116
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:23,880
then I'll look deep inside.

1117
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:25,758
If the they say they like movies,

1118
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:26,986
I feel more drawn to them.

1119
00:50:29,341 --> 00:50:32,961
Then someone who is compassionate.

1120
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,150
Because my personality might seem...

1121
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:38,920
Too quiet?

1122
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:40,790
Too tight-lipped?

1123
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:42,457
Perhaps that's what they think.

1124
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:43,868
I'm probably someone

1125
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:45,506
(Hangyul is also a person who)
who has empathy as well.

1126
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,948
(has empathy, just like her ideal type)

1127
00:50:46,972 --> 00:50:48,128
Something like that.

1128
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,708
So the people you’ve dated so far

1129
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:57,150
they all kind of had those traits?

1130
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,185
I liked them first.

1131
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,414
So I approached them first.

1132
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:03,882
No matter how you look at it,

1133
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:06,231
a lot of my relationships started

1134
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:08,624
from a more "receiver" position.

1135
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:15,041
From the receiver's perspective,

1136
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:17,560
but right now,

1137
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,252
that's not a relationship that

1138
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:20,496
you hate that much, right?

1139
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:22,487
That word receiver.

1140
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:24,533
I'm quite happy with

1141
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:28,350
the torture that

1142
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:32,410
comes from relationships.

1143
00:51:32,411 --> 00:51:33,963
I really like it.

1144
00:51:33,964 --> 00:51:35,391
Like,

1145
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:38,700
I just feel like,

1146
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:42,100
when I receive a lot from someone,

1147
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:45,032
I don’t really like

1148
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:46,992
that version of myself.

1149
00:51:47,873 --> 00:51:49,131
You feel uncomfortable when

1150
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:50,578
- someone does things for you?
- Yes.

1151
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:53,424
When someone says...

1152
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:55,118
“I’ll take care of it,”

1153
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,633
that makes me uncomfortable?

1154
00:51:56,634 --> 00:51:58,756
No, more than that...

1155
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:00,425
Well, umm...

1156
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,616
If they say, "For your sake,

1157
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:04,219
I’ll give up something,”

1158
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:06,117
“I’ll yield my choice to you,”

1159
00:52:06,178 --> 00:52:08,391
I’m like, “No. Don’t do that."

1160
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:09,552
"If you’re unhappy with me,

1161
00:52:09,572 --> 00:52:10,591
then just leave. Please.”

1162
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:12,188
I'm that type of person.

1163
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:14,115
I really don’t like when someone

1164
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,432
is holding back for my sake.

1165
00:52:16,457 --> 00:52:18,906
That feeling that they’re enduring me.

1166
00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:22,189
Of course I like enduring.

1167
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:26,013
But in this world, is there anything

1168
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,530
that doesn’t require endurance?

1169
00:52:27,554 --> 00:52:28,796
Mm.

1170
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:32,447
There are more things in life that

1171
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:34,632
you have to endure than that.

1172
00:52:34,753 --> 00:52:36,134
Good things too.

1173
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:37,660
For me?

1174
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,435
Is this called self-torture?

1175
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:41,568
But you've had a good lover, right?

1176
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:43,144
Yes. Good.

1177
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:45,158
It's not that bad.

1178
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,036
Maybe it’s just that person’s style.

1179
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:50,287
Probably just like being led a bit.

1180
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:52,265
Liked being taken care of.

1181
00:52:52,362 --> 00:52:53,810
Liked being a leader.

1182
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:56,722
They like to say things indirectly.

1183
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:58,655
I don't like it even

1184
00:52:58,662 --> 00:53:00,075
just thinking about it.

1185
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:03,020
Wait a minute.

1186
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:04,199
Save some food to eat

1187
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:05,494
at home on purpose.

1188
00:53:05,528 --> 00:53:06,597
Geez.

1189
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:07,689
You're taking it home.

1190
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,710
(Fresh cream)
This too. This too.

1191
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:11,765
This was done on purpose.

1192
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:13,236
This is a stain.

1193
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:16,492
Do you have tissues?

1194
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,573
- If you don't have tissues...
- I have some with me.

1195
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:24,819
(Minwoo wipes off the cream
on Hangyeol's hand)

1196
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:26,321
Is this self-torture too?

1197
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:27,422
Yes.

1198
00:53:27,722 --> 00:53:31,257
I've had experiences in that vibe.

1199
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:33,639
I've had those feelings.

1200
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,493
Actually, I can't do it.

1201
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:40,109
In that kind of atmosphere,

1202
00:53:40,377 --> 00:53:42,352
I don’t know how to respond.

1203
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,448
It's not a useless skin contact moment.

1204
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:48,645
I took courage to hold on.

1205
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:50,292
I feel a bit shy

1206
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,027
and a bit embarrassed.

1207
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,514
(After skinship, both of them
look strangely nervous)

1208
00:53:59,676 --> 00:54:00,984
(Glance)

1209
00:54:03,847 --> 00:54:06,872
(Shy)

1210
00:54:08,277 --> 00:54:12,340
It is just so much fun.

1211
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,262
I think a lot of people might

1212
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:15,970
find you attractive.

1213
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:17,219
- Me?
- Yes.

1214
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:22,343
I need to be the one who likes first.

1215
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:27,311
I was dating someone really cool

1216
00:54:27,336 --> 00:54:29,089
and amazing.

1217
00:54:29,211 --> 00:54:32,195
I have this thought in my head.

1218
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,183
The whole situation was surprising.

1219
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:37,164
It kind of felt like a dream

1220
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:38,911
and it was a bit strange.

1221
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,112
Aren’t you curious about this?
Want to try it?

1222
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:43,672
This is the signature menu.

1223
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:45,825
Is it okay to share with me?

1224
00:54:46,213 --> 00:54:48,036
- Share?
- Yes.

1225
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,994
Here, let's share.

1226
00:54:54,983 --> 00:54:57,509
(Hangyeol's matcha latte)
This one has a bit of powdery texture.

1227
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,283
I want to eat it when it melts more.

1228
00:54:59,284 --> 00:55:01,660
Because there’s powder on the bottom.

1229
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:03,505
This powder has to be sucked up.

1230
00:55:03,506 --> 00:55:06,679
You really identified the root well.

1231
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,902
You can tell by looking at it

1232
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:09,710
that the powder has clumped together.

1233
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:11,377
I thought this was syrup,

1234
00:55:11,398 --> 00:55:13,084
so I sucked it in.

1235
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:15,588
- Aren't you curios?
- Wow, flour.

1236
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:18,197
I thought it was powder in my mouth.

1237
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:19,409
Okay.

1238
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,330
(Intentionally stirring instead of
Hangyeol) I didn't plan on stirring it.

1239
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,919
The ones I cut at first

1240
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:28,891
didn't look so good.

1241
00:55:29,165 --> 00:55:31,136
(Glance)

1242
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:34,439
It looks like a work of art.

1243
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,839
But it's quite...

1244
00:55:36,188 --> 00:55:39,369
Overall, it looks like that.

1245
00:55:39,442 --> 00:55:40,788
It kind of looked like something

1246
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:41,882
you could call art.

1247
00:55:46,402 --> 00:55:47,590
But why do you always agree?

1248
00:55:47,705 --> 00:55:49,230
I was just talking aimlessly.

1249
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,952
It's like sending a small signal.

1250
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,473
Maybe others wouldn’t catch them,

1251
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,803
But to me, those little things

1252
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:01,396
about you were really cute.

1253
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:06,606
(Minwoo & Hangyul are good at sending
nonsensical stuff to each other)

1254
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,923
But I’m curious about something.

1255
00:56:09,924 --> 00:56:11,902
When I came in earlier,

1256
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:14,014
how was it when I came in?

1257
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:15,838
Like...

1258
00:56:17,966 --> 00:56:20,661
Just tell me honestly.

1259
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:24,600
It’s the kind of image that makes me

1260
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:27,350
think you wouldn’t have chosen me.

1261
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:28,857
I thought your type was someone

1262
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:31,198
from a completely different world.

1263
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:32,965
If we had met outside,

1264
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,658
I don't think we would

1265
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:36,771
have a chance to talk.

1266
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:38,512
If we’d met outside, I think

1267
00:56:38,526 --> 00:56:39,599
I would’ve walked up

1268
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,193
and asked who you were.

1269
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:45,705
- Me? Me?
- Yes.

1270
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:49,902
I'm not that attractive.

1271
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:51,419
I was probably just curious.

1272
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,615
Honestly, your face was the prettiest.

1273
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,895
- You’re my type.
- Really?

1274
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:56,913
Saying that is like saying something

1275
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,900
to make me feel good.

1276
00:56:58,901 --> 00:56:59,973
(Shy)

1277
00:56:59,974 --> 00:57:02,162
- But I’m not just saying that.
- Really?

1278
00:57:02,163 --> 00:57:03,289
Yes.

1279
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,375
Just saying it...

1280
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:05,376
when I first saw it,

1281
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,740
you were the prettiest.

1282
00:57:06,764 --> 00:57:08,405
The most beautiful one there.

1283
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:10,797
Actually, I...

1284
00:57:10,813 --> 00:57:12,624
I can’t look at you directly.

1285
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:13,925
- Me?
- Yes.

1286
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:15,435
What about this?

1287
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,818
Yes. Please do that.

1288
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:17,972
- That's quite...
- Yes.

1289
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:20,850
What is it? Kind of like...

1290
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:22,319
Kind of like

1291
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:25,114
you're from a totally different world.

1292
00:57:25,473 --> 00:57:26,588
What to do?

1293
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:29,927
It’s like you're from another world,

1294
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:32,805
we’ve lived such different lives.

1295
00:57:32,835 --> 00:57:33,975
I thought we wouldn’t

1296
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:35,519
have much in common.

1297
00:57:35,543 --> 00:57:37,214
Like our lives wouldn’t

1298
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:38,841
really connect well.

1299
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:40,933
And maybe you wouldn’t

1300
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:45,525
consider me as a potential partner.

1301
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:49,517
(Minwoo's style is beautiful and perfect)

1302
00:57:50,307 --> 00:57:53,953
(In contrast to Hangyeol who is
pressured by Minwoo's image)

1303
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:57,052
Tell me about yourself too.

1304
00:57:57,153 --> 00:57:59,783
I have a lot of stories.

1305
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:01,659
Didn't your hair turn white?

1306
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,826
Right now, it feels a bit like...

1307
00:58:05,828 --> 00:58:08,536
- I don’t know where I'm heading.
- Really?

1308
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:10,337
Going into my throat now.

1309
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,456
I'll tell you how far it's gone.

1310
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,438
Why is it so hard to digest?

1311
00:58:21,618 --> 00:58:23,892
If you come like this, I think

1312
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,404
you have to make it an abbreviation

1313
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,784
for chocolate cream.

1314
00:58:26,808 --> 00:58:29,258
- I have something like that.
- Right?

1315
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:30,419
(Ha, ha, ha)

1316
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,206
It's getting dirty here now.

1317
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,191
Why are you making a heart shape?

1318
00:58:36,192 --> 00:58:37,520
Does it look like a heart to you?

1319
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:38,716
It is a heart.

1320
00:58:38,717 --> 00:58:40,324
Right. A heart.

1321
00:58:40,325 --> 00:58:41,847
But now it's gotten so messy.

1322
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,686
Are you expressing

1323
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:47,833
your inner feelings like this?

1324
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:50,034
I kind of wanted to tease you because

1325
00:58:50,061 --> 00:58:51,596
you were acting all bashful and cute.

1326
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,353
You were drawing a heart with chocolate

1327
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:54,887
and whipped cream.

1328
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:56,535
Seeing someone who

1329
00:58:57,021 --> 00:58:58,116
can express themselves

1330
00:58:58,124 --> 00:58:59,234
so openly like that,

1331
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:00,258
I was kind of amazed.

1332
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:06,132
It's great to get to know you.

1333
00:59:06,754 --> 00:59:09,351
Yes?

1334
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:11,795
- It's good to have the time.
- It is nice to meet you.

1335
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:14,190
Are we getting to know each other?

1336
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:18,960
(Shy)

1337
00:59:22,117 --> 00:59:26,240
(Cute)

1338
00:59:27,936 --> 00:59:29,230
I was curious about something.

1339
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:30,809
Among older, younger, or same age,

1340
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:32,276
which do you prefer?

1341
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,735
I like older and same age.

1342
00:59:35,736 --> 00:59:36,802
But if we click well,

1343
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:38,142
I don’t mind younger either.

1344
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,622
Honestly, I thought I definitely

1345
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,167
like younger ones.

1346
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:47,211
- Something like that.
- What?

1347
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:50,043
I think I like younger by far.

1348
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,380
Even though I feel that way,

1349
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:54,514
I was really surprised

1350
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:57,411
that you chose me.

1351
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:59,216
Actually, I feel that way.

1352
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:00,658
Except for one person,

1353
01:00:00,683 --> 01:00:02,316
everyone looks younger than me.

1354
01:00:02,362 --> 01:00:04,902
To be honest, for me,

1355
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,577
that's not really an advantage.

1356
01:00:07,602 --> 01:00:11,318
That's why I said

1357
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,572
younger is alright.

1358
01:00:13,573 --> 01:00:15,307
It's okay.

1359
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,940
We can talk and understand each other.

1360
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:21,035
Now?

1361
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,453
If you feel like you can talk and

1362
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,526
understand each other, that's good.

1363
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,961
My heart is beating fast right now.

1364
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:30,621
I've noticed a little bit now.

1365
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,411
Secretly noticed.

1366
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:35,068
Really?

1367
01:00:35,804 --> 01:00:37,491
(Even though she was
attracted by her enthusiasm)

1368
01:00:37,492 --> 01:00:38,976
(But she got a sluggish response)

1369
01:00:39,278 --> 01:00:44,604
(Minwoo felt confused
With Hangyeol's reaction)

1370
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,213
She was actually embarrassed.

1371
01:00:47,214 --> 01:00:49,455
In this roundabout, philosophical way,

1372
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:51,534
but in the end,

1373
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:53,618
"I’m interested too,"

1374
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:54,773
that's what I think.

1375
01:00:54,815 --> 01:00:57,805
She's an amazing person.

1376
01:00:57,806 --> 01:00:59,127
Someone I want to get to know.

1377
01:01:00,762 --> 01:01:03,729
Minwoo doesn't know my age yet, right?

1378
01:01:05,193 --> 01:01:06,328
But actually, when I meet

1379
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:07,528
someone around my age,

1380
01:01:07,552 --> 01:01:09,457
it kind of feels like

1381
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,611
they can increase positive energy.

1382
01:01:11,612 --> 01:01:14,086
I think she has an image that she would

1383
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,421
never like someone at my age.

1384
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,978
The liking she shows now,

1385
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:23,792
I actually don't know

1386
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:24,866
if it will remain the same

1387
01:01:24,873 --> 01:01:26,046
after knowing my age.

1388
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,862
I think it's ambiguous.

1389
01:01:30,602 --> 01:01:35,205
(Two people who judge each other's
actions and feelings differently)

1390
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:40,455
(Which way will the feelings of two people
who are going in opposite directions flow?)

1391
01:01:41,817 --> 01:01:43,112
Why did you erase this?

1392
01:01:43,113 --> 01:01:44,405
(The blackboard with the missing name)

1393
01:01:44,429 --> 01:01:46,513
Erased it or walk past it

1394
01:01:46,538 --> 01:01:48,306
and it's erased?

1395
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:54,328
(Heeyoung starts writing again)

1396
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:05,452
(Hmm...)

1397
01:02:08,152 --> 01:02:11,117
(Received item)

1398
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:18,714
(Creating work(?))

1399
01:02:30,129 --> 01:02:33,473
(Add details)

1400
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:44,604
(Satisfied)

1401
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:53,201
(Because of Heeyoung
Together House blackboard is back)
