1
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:41,967
- What? A sudden notification.
- It's a love letter.

2
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:43,537
A love letter.

3
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:45,687
Huh?

4
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:51,467
I don't know.

5
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,586
Select the anonymous
letter you received.

6
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:59,286
(Select the anonymous
letter you received.)

7
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:00,277
Wow!

8
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:01,326
(Take a photo, send it to us
and we'll tell who sent it.)

9
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,057
Wow, hurry up!

10
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:05,547
Select a letter?

11
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:07,187
I'll be back in a minute.

12
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,067
Oho.

13
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,357
This is getting fun!

14
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:14,677
Oops, only four minutes left!

15
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:19,067
What? I need watch it now.

16
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,837
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Three minutes left.

17
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,486
Everyone looks so rushed.

18
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:30,137
Huh?

19
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:31,257
Everyone is in a hurry.

20
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,957
(To Heeyoung, why weren't you so clear? Firstly, I'm sorry! I've been
reclusive because of my heartache!) I couldn't understand the content.

21
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,376
(To Heeyoung, why weren't you so clear? Firstly, I'm sorry! I've
been reclusive because of my heartache!) The sentence was so weird.

22
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:39,986
'I started to think maybe a someone
wrote it to confuse me.'

23
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,237
I had that thought for a moment,

24
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,796
but I really had no idea who sent it.

25
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:46,847
So I chose that one right away.

26
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,637
You already send?

27
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:49,887
I already know.

28
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:51,786
I know, so I didn't need to send one.

29
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:52,377
Mm.

30
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:53,037
Are you sure?

31
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,037
Mm.

32
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,786
(To Heeyoung, your smile is so beautiful)
First of all, in the first letter.

33
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:59,197
(To Heeyoung, your smile is so beautiful)
Riwon once said it herself.

34
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:01,717
(To Seoyeon, are you really caring?)
The second letter is from Minwoo.

35
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:04,176
(To Seoyeon, are you really caring?)
Because she made
it obvious to the letter.

36
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:07,426
Because I only got two letters total,

37
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,547
I didn't have a letter to ask about.

38
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,307
There was only one letter

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,023
I was genuinely curious about.

40
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:14,787
Just one.

41
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:17,727
(To Jinah, I wonder if you'll be moved by the person
you're dating today!) On the first day, I really had

42
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,258
(To Jinah, I wonder if you'll be moved by the person you're
dating today!) no clue who the second letter was from.

43
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,436
(To Minwoo, good night.)
A letter that says 'Good night.'

44
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,436
(To Minwoo, good night.)
Wishing me a good sleep,

45
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:30,666
(To Minwoo, good night.)
and that meant a lot to me.

46
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,616
Honestly, I got my hopes up.

47
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,597
That's why I wanted to know

48
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,302
who sent it the most.

49
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,427
So I chose that one.

50
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:40,516
(To Dagyo, it would be great if I could sit next to
you... Next time, I want to go on a date with you.)

51
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:42,916
(Dagyo and Mirang who are in another
location also received the messages.)

52
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,406
(To Mirang, I wonder if once we get to know each
other better we'll talk about new things! Haha)

53
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,493
The drawing of the suitcase on it

54
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,103
was also super cute.

55
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,866
I thought it was from Jinah,

56
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,200
and I wanted to confirm

57
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,526
if it really was her.

58
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:58,117
(Now that you know the identity of
Love Letters, what will everyone do?)

59
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,117
Huh, it's here!

60
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:02,127
(To Heeyoung, why weren't you so clear? Firstly, I'm
sorry! I've been reclusive because of my heartache!)

61
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,196
(To Heeyoung, why weren't you so clear? Firstly, I'm sorry!
(I've been reclusive because of my heartache!) Who could it be?

62
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:07,487
(The person who wrote
this letter is Kim Jinah.)

63
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:08,517
Is it Mirang?

64
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:12,227
Oh, seriously?

65
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:31,317
Dammit.

66
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,688
That's insane.

67
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:33,857
I didn't expect it.

68
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:39,712
I'm so curious who it was.

69
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,867
I really didn't expect that.

70
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:43,547
What to do?

71
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,292
Who could it be to make
you react like that?

72
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:47,597
Dang, I cannot believe it.

73
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,957
What egg?

74
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,016
Oww...

75
00:03:57,017 --> 00:04:00,697
Oww... It's so fun.

76
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,482
I kept saying I didn't

77
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,167
understand the letter, right?

78
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,732
But now it totally makes sense?

79
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:11,776
The content is still weird.

80
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:14,156
Still weird, honestly.

81
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:15,157
Jinah.

82
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:18,346
(Shocked)

83
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:19,386
When... When was that one written?

84
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:20,557
Last time, I guess...

85
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,627
What was the content about?

86
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,016
'Why weren't you so clear?
Firstly, I'm sorry!'

87
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,086
'I've been reclusive'

88
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:31,717
because of my heartache...'

89
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:32,807
What does it mean?

90
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,527
Sorry for liking you.

91
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:36,896
It was an apology.

92
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:37,897
Just saying sorry.

93
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,196
Oh, that's why I didn't know who it was.

94
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,047
I cut her off from the beginning.

95
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,696
So that's how it is.

96
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:46,686
I really tried to understand.

97
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:47,796
Even though I know who it is now,

98
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:49,836
but I still don't understand.

99
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,897
So what exactly do you want?

100
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,666
(To Jinah, I wonder if you'll be moved
by the person you're dating today!)

101
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:02,046
(The person who wrote
this letter is Kim Mirang.)

102
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,666
I sent the second letter on the first day.

103
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,186
Mirang.

104
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:07,806
It's such a shame, honestly.

105
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,673
When it comes to love,

106
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,753
timing is everything.

107
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,947
When you want to get to know

108
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,828
someone but feel uncertain,

109
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,618
you have to just go for it

110
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:21,013
without hesitation.

111
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:24,637
I regret that I couldn't do that,

112
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:26,390
but I feel like I learned

113
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:27,713
something really important.

114
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:29,623
From now on, in any future love

115
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:30,810
I experience,

116
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:32,063
I won't ever worry,

117
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:37,082
I won't let fear or hesitation

118
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,982
get in the way.

119
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:43,227
I'll go all in, without regret.

120
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:50,316
(To Minwoo, good night.)

121
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,006
(The person who wrote
this letter is Kim Seoyeon.)

122
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:54,067
That's what I thought.

123
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,526
I knew someone would noticed

124
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:58,576
that I don't sleep well.

125
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,846
It wasn't a random person,

126
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:02,587
so I wasn't that surprised,

127
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:04,847
and I wasn't disappointed either,

128
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,957
but I was a little bummed

129
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,630
it wasn't Heeyoung.

130
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:14,616
(To Dagyo, it would be great if I could sit next to
you... Next time, I want to go on a date with you.)

131
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:16,846
(The person who wrote this
letter is Jeong Hangyeol)

132
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:17,917
Oh.

133
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:19,917
So that's how it was.

134
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:27,066
(To Mirang, I wonder if once we get to know each
other better we'll talk about new things! Haha)

135
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,986
(The person who wrote
this letter is Kim Jinah)

136
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:30,457
She didn't even show any signs

137
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,146
of having feelings for me,

138
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:34,286
but she clearly showed
her feelings twice.

139
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:35,406
I was really thankful.

140
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:37,457
I'd said I was a fan of that person,

141
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,176
and after sending the first letter,

142
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:42,226
I didn't send another one.

143
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:44,866
'It's more of a pity than a regret.'

144
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,237
That's how I thought.

145
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:51,117
(Will the girls' hearts beat fast?)

146
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,556
Should we do a face mask before bed?

147
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:55,867
Yeah, sounds great.

148
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,127
Help me apply it.

149
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,396
Do mine for me.

150
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:01,477
- Want me to apply it?
- Mm.

151
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,333
Since we were at the beach,

152
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,266
But the beach in the morning,

153
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,956
the wind was really strong.

154
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:11,177
The weather was nice because the wind.

155
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:13,837
Have you done this before?

156
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:15,787
Has anyone ever done this for you?

157
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:18,346
Never.

158
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:21,657
My hands are shaking so much.

159
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:24,797
I'm nervous.

160
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:25,963
I've never helped anyone

161
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,301
put a face mask on.

162
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,797
- Really?
- Mm.

163
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:34,917
(Dagyo puts a face mask on
herself to nourish Mirang's skin.)

164
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:42,917
(A moment alone between the
two where no one disturbs them.)

165
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,377
Wait a minute.

166
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,212
Other masks are usually very thin.

167
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:50,796
It feels like wet wipes.

168
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:53,706
But this one is thick and bouncy.

169
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,937
You can even sleep with it on.

170
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:58,012
At least 3 hours is best.

171
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,916
- What does it help with?
- It says it works well as a sleeping pack.

172
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:01,107
(Sleeping mask rich in collagen
is good for long-term use.)

173
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,337
The one we're using today is collagen.

174
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:04,837
How is it?

175
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:05,866
- So good!
- You always say that.

176
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:10,536
If it's with you, I like anything.

177
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:11,617
Everything is good?

178
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:13,157
Should I put one on you too?

179
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:14,157
Yes, please.

180
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,257
You're better at applying it than I am.

181
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:34,607
How is it?

182
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:36,806
Does it fit well?

183
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,106
Your skin looks great.

184
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:40,676
Even with the mask on,
you say my skin looks amazing?

185
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:42,516
Your skin is really amazing.

186
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:43,526
It's glowing.

187
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,723
Leaving the mask on will make

188
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,997
your skin super hydrated.

189
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,227
You can even lie sideways

190
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,533
and it won't fall off.

191
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:50,107
Let's sleep with them on tonight.

192
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:53,537
It feels kind of exciting.

193
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:55,517
Why?

194
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,387
Sleeping like this really
feels different, right?

195
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:03,567
Mm.

196
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:08,057
Have you checked all the letters yet?

197
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:10,976
Everyone wrote to flatter you, right?

198
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:11,977
Mm, but yeah.

199
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:14,927
Really?

200
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:16,127
And you?

201
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:17,737
I don't think so.

202
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:19,813
When I put it together,

203
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,571
I remembered the memories from that day.

204
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,876
The handwriting is so cute.

205
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:27,017
This isn't a letter asking to
get to know me.

206
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,517
The letter that was sent to me.

207
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31,527
Not sleepy?

208
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:33,017
Mm.

209
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,446
(Suddenly)

210
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,447
You can lift your leg.

211
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,637
Where? Here?

212
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,227
Put it up.

213
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:45,227
No...

214
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:46,986
You can't.

215
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,997
Why not? I like lifting legs.

216
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,873
Really?

217
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:57,577
My legs are really heavy.

218
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,317
Oh, it's fine.

219
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:03,907
Do you like skinship?

220
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:06,317
Mm.

221
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,257
Why'd you ask?

222
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:12,687
Did you ask me because you like it?

223
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:13,917
Mm.

224
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:16,727
Now your ears are burning.

225
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:20,337
I...

226
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:28,487
What?

227
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,203
You're imagining things

228
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:32,370
about me, aren't you?

229
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,197
No. Why are you saying that?

230
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:36,806
Caught you.

231
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,326
No.

232
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,216
What are you talking about?

233
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,350
You were the one who

234
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,753
asked about that first.

235
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:44,937
I didn't think about that kind of thing.

236
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:52,686
(Acting cutesy)

237
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:53,697
Oww, geez.

238
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,087
You got stabbed.

239
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:59,146
Done.

240
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:01,017
(Imagine) All done.

241
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:04,317
(Shy)

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,840
Can I rub around your belly?

243
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:17,387
What are you saying?

244
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:21,747
Why are you so slim?

245
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:27,577
Why are your ribs sticking out so much?

246
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:31,717
Because I'm lying down.

247
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,147
Too skinny.

248
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:41,007
(The night the two became closer)
Guess I'll rub while
you're sitting down.

249
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:46,542
But honestly, all the timing so far

250
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,927
it's been weirdly perfect.

251
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,852
Even how I ended up suddenly

252
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,677
going on a date with Dagyo,

253
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,037
Seoyeon suddenly took Mirang on a date

254
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,807
and it turned out like this.

255
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,347
I didn't think it would end like that.

256
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:01,217
But what happened to me?

257
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:02,942
Can you tell me?

258
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:04,687
About Jinah?

259
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,187
I'm still hung up on, Jinah.

260
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:12,156
There are only a few days left.

261
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:13,423
It seemed like she

262
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:15,117
became really isolated.

263
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:18,276
'She looked like she was left out'

264
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:20,036
When I get that feeling,

265
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,146
I wonder why someone

266
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,417
has to carry that feeling.

267
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:28,317
(Heeyoung's heartfelt thoughts
after going on a dating with Jinah)

268
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,997
She was a roommate along with Dagyo.

269
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,717
She came on really strong with me.

270
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:35,827
She was talking about

271
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,043
her life philosophy,

272
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,647
values, marriage…

273
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,712
Then she started saying things like,

274
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:43,323
if someone changes or

275
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,726
if people act a certain way,

276
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:47,017
she'll reject them using any excuses.

277
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,616
(However, Heeyoung, who received 0 votes, has a different opinion
from Jinah's words.) She kept telling me that I couldn't do it,

278
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,707
she kept telling me that.

279
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:53,887
So...

280
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:55,940
(The situation is that a misunderstanding is forming because
actions are different from words.) These are the people whose words

281
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:56,993
(The situation is that a misunderstanding is forming because
actions are different from words.) and action don't match.

282
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,447
And I just stayed quiet.

283
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:01,083
But I didn't have a second choice,

284
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,793
because they told us to

285
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,607
send within five minutes.

286
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,096
So I wrote right away.

287
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,226
But as I left,

288
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:10,047
she said some sarcastic remarks.

289
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,542
Ah, I get it, because of you,

290
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,636
now I have to go on a date
with someone else.'

291
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:16,906
He was saying stuff like,
'I was using you, '

292
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,157
I was just speechless.

293
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:19,963
Suppose I was in

294
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:21,083
the same position as Jinah

295
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,057
and we didn't match and go on a date,

296
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:24,282
then that would mean she lied.

297
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:25,866
But if it wasn't a lie

298
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,856
and was just a system error,

299
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,317
the outcome would've
been different.

300
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,727
It's possible.

301
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:34,803
I just couldn't accept

302
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:35,923
that kind of attitude.

303
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:38,507
(Heeyoung felt
disappointed in her attitude)

304
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,107
I had all these thoughts in my head,

305
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,720
but I didn't want to make it a big deal.

306
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:43,950
I didn't say much

307
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,313
because I was still confused

308
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:47,306
and just tried to focus
on other things instead.

309
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,906
When she did talk to me
from time to time,

310
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,917
I would respond,

311
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,837
but she said she was having
a hard time because of me

312
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:56,266
saying her PTSD from being bullied
was triggered again.

313
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,326
Because of me, I ended up
being excluded by others,

314
00:13:58,327 --> 00:13:59,117
ignored,

315
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,677
and caught up in clique behavior.

316
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,096
She told me I was cliquish toward her,

317
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:07,057
she said she wanted to leave.

318
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,736
She felt like we couldn't communicate,

319
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,069
that it was all one-sided.

320
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:16,297
(The two could not come to an understanding
even after talking for a long time.)

321
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:17,753
It was just my own

322
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:18,957
frustration with myself,

323
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:22,137
more than what Jinah passed on to me.

324
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:27,717
(At the same time, Hangyeol also
witnessed Heeyoung's feelings.)

325
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:32,247
(Worries)

326
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:38,917
(Will Hangyeol's feelings change?)

327
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:43,017
(The morning of the sixth day,
the weather is clear.)

328
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,917
(The day of the gathering,
the last date)

329
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:51,247
(Will their fate change in one day?)

330
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,797
My mission is to open up and talk to

331
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,426
Hangyeol and Seoyeon today and tomorrow

332
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:57,807
because if we leave,

333
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,253
we may never have the chance

334
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,436
to greet each other again.

335
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:01,137
Right.

336
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:03,057
I have something on my mind right now,

337
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,236
for Hangyeol.

338
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,017
As for Seoyeon,

339
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:09,936
I'm borrowing Mirang's words,

340
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,073
People who are open about themselves

341
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:12,113
and tell me that they like me,

342
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,476
and I like people like that too.

343
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,752
I never had to go through

344
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:15,873
something tough.

345
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:17,477
Unrequited love with Hetero?

346
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:19,146
I never had to go through
one-sided love.

347
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:21,096
I've only ever been liked and asked out.

348
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:22,857
So all of this is super awkward for me.

349
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,267
'I like you first' 'Please like me too'

350
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:25,376
I've never said that before.

351
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:26,507
It's not that I'm that good.

352
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,507
I don't love that way
because I'm scared.

353
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:29,596
Because I have anxiety.

354
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,666
If I really had the chance to

355
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:32,924
talk to Seoyeon and

356
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,344
Hangyeol face to face...

357
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,437
This morning when I woke up,

358
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,486
I thought 'Just one more night,

359
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:42,337
and I can finally leave this house.'

360
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:43,896
But this thought is not like,

361
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:46,567
'I'm having a hard time
and I want to escape.'

362
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,376
That's not it.

363
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:50,210
In a lot of ways,

364
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,757
I think I've grown so much.

365
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,483
When I go out, I'll go and

366
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,913
develop this experience,

367
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:59,256
A stronger and cooler me.

368
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:02,043
I'm also more confident

369
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:03,942
that I can live well

370
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,947
as a lesbian in Korea.

371
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:08,157
Yes, there are cases like this.

372
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:10,836
Minwoo!

373
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,396
Who's there?

374
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,057
It's me, Heeyoung.

375
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:15,776
Hey, can I borrow your lash curler?

376
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:16,607
What?

377
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,087
- Lash curler.
- Lash curler?

378
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,496
Why are you getting dressed so early?

379
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,557
You're up so early.

380
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:24,547
Thanks.

381
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,587
I'll come visit.

382
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:30,367
Umm...

383
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,426
Even though Jinah's my roommate,

384
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,286
the fact that she coincidentally came

385
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,493
at our first building

386
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:39,783
without any problems,

387
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,457
I think it's a good sign for us.

388
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:43,187
Maybe she doesn't dislike her.

389
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:45,077
Maybe she still cares.

390
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:46,772
I'm okay with that.

391
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:49,193
Even if there's just a 10% chance,

392
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:50,757
that's enough.

393
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:54,392
(Knock, knock)

394
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,717
(Heeyoung looks in a hurry.)

395
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:03,267
Heeyoung! What's the matter?

396
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,197
I'm going to change clothes.

397
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:06,917
Oh...

398
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,117
There's no time.

399
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:17,107
60 59 58 57...

400
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,197
Hello.

401
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:24,677
I'm sorry.

402
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:26,167
Thank you.

403
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:27,487
It's Seoyeon!

404
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,612
From early morning,

405
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,313
I woke up in battle mode.

406
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:33,984
I worked out,

407
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:36,583
ate breakfast alone, picked out clothes

408
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,037
and tried to guess what kind

409
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,960
of dating mission it might be.

410
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,590
I thought maybe it would be something

411
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,393
like “first come, first served,”

412
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:44,796
so I put my shoes on,

413
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:46,723
sat by the shoe rack,

414
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,217
ready to run out the moment.

415
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:52,337
(Hum a song)

416
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:56,536
(Seoyeon looks great today.)

417
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:58,716
When I woke up this morning,

418
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:00,756
I thought today is the last day,

419
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:02,576
I think it would be nice to go on

420
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,490
a date with Dagyo.

421
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:06,207
Because after today,

422
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:07,743
there won't be another chance.

423
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:08,897
I want to say all the things

424
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,125
I haven't been able to say,

425
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,910
In order not to regret it

426
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:13,368
at the last minute,

427
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,607
I would like to try a date with Dagyo.

428
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:21,446
(Minwoo and Heeyoung
are ready to go out)

429
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,847
Where are you going, though?

430
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:25,117
I can't guess today at all.

431
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:27,167
But even I myself don't know

432
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:28,956
what will happen next.

433
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:31,317
So if I go on a date

434
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:33,923
and it ends up being with someone else,

435
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,717
what would you think about that?

436
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,017
Then it's your freedom.

437
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:39,707
Ask yourself if you want to

438
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,143
get to know someone.

439
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,353
And if you really want to

440
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,823
know more, it's probably real.

441
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,357
I've never dated like this

442
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:48,357
with anyone before.

443
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,837
Don't worry about that because of me,

444
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,597
Don't force anything,

445
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:53,773
just follow your heart and

446
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:54,983
do whatever you want to know.

447
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,200
I think it would be better than

448
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,143
to solve the problem.

449
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,487
I think that way too.

450
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,063
I want you to think that way as well.

451
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,917
- I thought you'd say the same thing.
- I thought so too.

452
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,137
But I was curious how you'd react.

453
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:07,399
Me? I understood.

454
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:08,894
Because if the curiosity lingers,

455
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:09,654
you'll always wonder.

456
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,679
Mm.

457
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:12,934
I'm more curious now.

458
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:16,694
- I got it.
- See you later.

459
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,037
When she said 'Try it out.

460
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,150
But it'll still be the thing

461
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:21,190
that I'm most curious about.'

462
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:22,414
She looked cool.

463
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,973
I wasn't exactly feeling great.

464
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,300
I feel bad because it's like

465
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:29,767
I need to ask for permission

466
00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:31,190
for them to like me.

467
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:34,214
Saying “I hope you don't go.”

468
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:38,694
I don't have the right to say that much.

469
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,554
And trying to block her from going

470
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:43,972
felt like it would only hurt me more.

471
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:47,344
So saying “I'm not okay with this...”

472
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:51,064
That's why I backed out first.

473
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,874
(Mirang and Dagyo's morning,
who slept together all night)

474
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:06,354
(Abruptly)

475
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:09,654
(Stares)

476
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:15,933
(The mask turned
translucent after waking up)

477
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,204
Take it out for me, please.

478
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:25,083
Everything is whiter except the eyes.

479
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,174
Huh? Really?

480
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:28,894
That's a lie! What the heck.

481
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:33,574
I'm not lying. Your skin is whiter.

482
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:36,414
Really?

483
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:39,654
(Mirang's compliment on
Dagyo's skin looking brighter)

484
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
I'm not lying.

485
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:43,794
I'm so sleepy.

486
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:45,434
Super sleepy.

487
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,390
Are you going to continue sleeping?

488
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:50,870
I don't know,

489
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,250
but it'll probably feel

490
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,577
better if I get up.

491
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,020
(Mirang quietly walks away from
Dagyo who's still not fully awake.)

492
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:05,154
(Exhausted)

493
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:16,054
Ow, I'm so tired.

494
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,773
(What's the reason for getting up
first even though her body is still tired?)

495
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:34,754
(Mirang drives towards somewhere)

496
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:38,854
(Where is the place that Mirang
is heading to alone?)

497
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:48,904
('K' cafe)

498
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:53,453
Hello.

499
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:54,873
I've been here for coffee before.

500
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:56,713
It was great, so I came back again.

501
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:57,714
Thank you.

502
00:21:58,274 --> 00:22:01,614
I'd like to order two Americanos.

503
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:03,284
But which coffee beans

504
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:04,817
are more delicious?

505
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:07,363
'ISO 500' is a high-quality coffee bean.

506
00:22:07,364 --> 00:22:08,410
If you like it strong,

507
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:09,800
you must try 'ISO 500'.

508
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:13,183
Ah, then I'll get two of the 'IS 500s.'

509
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,884
- Two 'ISO 500s.'
- Yes.

510
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,953
And one matcha cracker

511
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:19,963
and one salted cracker.

512
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,704
Oh, does this cafe...

513
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:24,824
I'm actually from Seoul,

514
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,663
Is there a way to buy it
and drink it there?

515
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,053
We have drip bags.

516
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:29,363
Oh, you have drip bags?

517
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:30,164
Yes, we have drip bags.

518
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:31,874
Please give me a recommendation.

519
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:33,964
Right now, we have

520
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:35,435
four blends of drip bags

521
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:37,049
and one decaf.

522
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,249
If you like something simple

523
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:39,370
and don't want to waste money,

524
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:41,003
the brand Rehearsal is a great choice.

525
00:22:41,004 --> 00:22:42,344
(Mirang's buying a drip bag to take back to
Seoul.) Yes, this is the brand Rehearsal.

526
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:43,664
And here we have a bag of

527
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:45,230
Americano drip coffee.

528
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:49,014
- I'll take a bag of Rehearsal.
- Sure.

529
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:50,287
Yes.

530
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:58,354
(Making coffee to relieve
Mirang and Dagyo's fatigue)

531
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:05,453
It's ready.

532
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,044
Thank you.

533
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:16,454
Park Dagyo.

534
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:17,744
Yes?

535
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:19,384
What did you bring?

536
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:21,644
Coffee and cake.

537
00:23:22,174 --> 00:23:23,004
Cake?

538
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:24,304
Yes, cake.

539
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,433
I woke up and her,

540
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:30,414
she had brought coffee and dessert.

541
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:31,694
I was seriously touched.

542
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:35,734
Last night we slept together happily,

543
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,223
so when we woke up, we were tired.

544
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:38,404
- Did you choose them?
- Yeah.

545
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:40,330
I guess this must be

546
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:41,404
their signature item.

547
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:43,704
Which one do you like more?

548
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:45,714
Let's share half and half and see.

549
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:47,653
I think I'll like this one more.

550
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:49,114
- This?
- Mm.

551
00:23:49,424 --> 00:23:50,733
Do you like green tea?

552
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:50,954
Mm.

553
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,584
Oh.

554
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:56,054
(Crispy)

555
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:01,404
Mmm. Good.

556
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:03,554
- It's good.
- Really good.

557
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:05,874
I really like it.

558
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:08,794
How was it?

559
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:09,824
This piece?

560
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:11,424
Sleeping in the same bed.

561
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:13,492
We're roommates, but we hadn't

562
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,150
shared the same bed before, right?

563
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,804
Sleeping in the same bed,

564
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:20,964
it felt a bit intense.

565
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:25,274
I couldn't sleep. My heart was pounding.

566
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:28,624
I'm so sleepy now.

567
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:31,494
And you?

568
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:33,084
Do you still need to ask?

569
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:37,854
(Shy)

570
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:40,223
For sure, sleeping in the same room

571
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:42,174
is totally different.

572
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:44,934
(Shy)

573
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:48,854
(Smiles)

574
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:50,434
I think one-night stands made

575
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,807
us feel awkward.

576
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,783
Overall, I was satisfied.

577
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:57,613
I wanted to go on a second date.

578
00:24:57,614 --> 00:24:58,907
Because we went on a date before,

579
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:00,420
even though we're just roommates,

580
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,137
sleeping in the same bed with someone

581
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:03,700
is different from sleeping separately.

582
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:04,910
So I became curious about what

583
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:05,930
it would be like to share a bed,

584
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:07,164
and through that, I got to

585
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:08,670
understand her feelings more

586
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:10,034
just like on that day.

587
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:13,174
Wow, the sky is so clear.

588
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:14,704
It's beautiful.

589
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:17,663
(Mirang and Dagyo return to the
accommodation with their memories.)

590
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:19,724
It's great, this kind of weather.

591
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:21,960
Even though we're very busy, we

592
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,680
still need to find time for ourselves.

593
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:24,254
Yes.

594
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,543
Put the phones away.

595
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:27,884
And we're in Jeju,

596
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:29,624
so it feels really far from everything.

597
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:31,793
If this was just the
outskirts of Gyeonggi,

598
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:32,853
it wouldn't feel like this, right?

599
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:34,313
Yeah, definitely wouldn't.

600
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,303
It wouldn't feel as detached.

601
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:37,304
Correct.

602
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:39,234
This lets you immerse yourself more.

603
00:25:39,764 --> 00:25:41,224
- Really immersed.
- Mm.

604
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,694
Once it's over, it's going

605
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:44,830
to feel like a dream.

606
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:45,854
Mm.

607
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:48,677
I heard we're going

608
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,391
to the beach tomorrow.

609
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:51,274
(A week in Jeju Island passed quickly.)

610
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:53,444
The time here seems so short.

611
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,173
Really?

612
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,774
At first I thought the route was far.

613
00:25:57,784 --> 00:25:59,743
But it's actually not that far.

614
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:01,403
It's really ambiguous. If
the route is long, it's long.

615
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:04,073
- If it's short, it's very short.
- When it's short, it's very short.

616
00:26:04,074 --> 00:26:04,764
Yeah.

617
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,293
If we were going home today,

618
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:08,024
I would've felt really sad.

619
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:09,683
The trip was a bit short.

620
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:10,684
Mm.

621
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:12,334
I want to spend a little more time...

622
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,939
together.

623
00:26:13,964 --> 00:26:16,530
(The memories of Jeju Island will
stay in their memory for a long time.)

624
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:19,854
(Please gather at building one.)

625
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:21,424
Why aren't they coming?

626
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:22,934
Because

627
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:24,327
yesterday, maybe they slept in

628
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,794
a single bed or a double bed?

629
00:26:27,444 --> 00:26:28,854
Why does that matter?

630
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:32,904
It's just the two of them.

631
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:34,504
When are they coming?

632
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:36,193
They can be connected to
become a single bed.

633
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,124
Still not here?

634
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,304
It's our room. So they're not back yet.

635
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:40,794
- Hello! Hello!
- They're here.

636
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:43,834
- Hello.
- What? Still not back?

637
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:46,304
Hello.

638
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:48,727
Hangyeol, your styling keeps

639
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:50,041
getting prettier and prettier.

640
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:56,744
We're going to Building one right?

641
00:26:57,144 --> 00:26:57,794
Building one.

642
00:26:57,794 --> 00:26:58,284
Oh, right.

643
00:26:58,294 --> 00:26:59,394
Oh, that's right.

644
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:01,727
We're gone all day,

645
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,681
something must have happened.

646
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:09,453
They're here.

647
00:27:09,454 --> 00:27:10,833
Oh, hello.

648
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,564
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

649
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:15,273
Mirang came in first.

650
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:16,783
I thought I'd feel bad seeing her,

651
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:17,947
but I was kind of happy

652
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,240
when I saw her first.

653
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,114
Then Dagyo also came in,

654
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:23,454
I saw here sat beside Mirang.

655
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:26,345
I started feeling not so great again.

656
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:28,336
Mirang came back looking

657
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:29,560
totally exhausted.

658
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:31,156
It really looked like an example of

659
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:32,720
an older-younger dynamic.

660
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:33,905
How are you guys feeling?

661
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,064
We just went...

662
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,664
Let's play some games.

663
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:40,570
Writing answers to this

664
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:42,030
and that questions.

665
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:44,053
What do we do in the evening?

666
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:47,403
Oh, the Mimibibi couple will visit us.

667
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,693
- The four of us cook together.
- Really?

668
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:50,774
That's why it's called Double Date.

669
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:52,894
Oh, that kind of Double Date.

670
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,614
That's why it's called Double Date.

671
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:57,044
We talk and cook and eat together.

672
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:58,074
I don't care about any of that.

673
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,574
Was it one bed or two?

674
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,800
We were on the first floor.

675
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:02,340
It was a one big double bed.

676
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:03,454
A double king?

677
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:05,503
(Startle)

678
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,850
And we put face masks

679
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,261
on each other's faces.

680
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:11,077
- Do you sleep under the same blanket?
- Yes, under the same blanket.

681
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,333
As I listened, I felt relieved.

682
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:15,894
She said it was a fun time

683
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,645
and they shared the same bed.

684
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:19,106
I think I ended up sleeping more

685
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,480
because we were roommates.

686
00:28:20,704 --> 00:28:21,774
Besides,

687
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:23,993
It didn't seem like it was a date

688
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,133
with any romantic sparks
or fluttery moments.

689
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,304
So I was relieved.

690
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,564
- Wait a minute.
- My phone.

691
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:33,084
Let's watch together.

692
00:28:33,574 --> 00:28:34,880
Today is the last

693
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:36,839
one-on-one date on day 6.

694
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:38,384
Please submit the name of

695
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:39,970
the person you want to date.

696
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:42,194
(Please submit the name of
the person you want to date.)

697
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:46,703
Of course, I'll ask Hangyeol out.

698
00:28:46,704 --> 00:28:48,933
I regret not having enough time
to get to know her.

699
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,573
And I don't want to leave the house

700
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:54,684
with that lingering feeling.

701
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:01,177
The first time I saw the word

702
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,295
'A one-on-one date
without any conditions'

703
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:05,943
I suddenly thought,
'Oh, that's how it should be.'

704
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,214
My fingers moved without

705
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:09,574
even seeing the content below.

706
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:12,013
As soon as the opportunity arose,

707
00:29:12,014 --> 00:29:14,364
I immediately sent you Dagyo's name.

708
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:16,664
Oh, where's my phone?

709
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:18,670
I couldn't find my phone,

710
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:20,430
even though it's definitely there.

711
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:21,424
But

712
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:22,873
- You see...
- Oh, it's right here.

713
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,523
Under the blanket here

714
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:25,354
it must be hidden.

715
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:26,294
You hid it, right?

716
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:28,533
- Me? Me?
- Seoyeon hid it.

717
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:29,793
Geez.

718
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:32,464
- Why, what's wrong?
- Definitely got cut in.

719
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:33,930
It's a date where you

720
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:35,400
can only choose one person.

721
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:36,857
I'm a little worried because

722
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:38,209
I heard the rules like that.

723
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,505
I already knew others were

724
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:41,031
going to send it to Dagyo too.

725
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,704
Because I am in that situation too.

726
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:45,974
I was already in a heartbroken state,

727
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:47,819
And I found your phone late,

728
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:50,324
someone must have sent Dagyo's name.

729
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:57,194
(The final, carefully delivered message)

730
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:59,493
Is there a time limit for sending this?

731
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:02,103
No, I just sent it quickly.

732
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:02,754
Why?

733
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:04,463
- Because it's first come, first served.
- First come, first served.

734
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:05,974
If multiple people send it,

735
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:08,134
- the one who sent it first goes.
- That's right.

736
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:09,610
But what if going

737
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:10,950
later is actually better?

738
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:12,123
Because even if everyone

739
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:13,824
rushes to send it, it will be in order.

740
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:16,523
- Ah.
- Ah, ah, ah.

741
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,394
Well, you can still send,

742
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:19,324
it's done in order.

743
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:21,594
Calm down! It's the last day.

744
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:22,613
That's how it is!

745
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:23,494
Sending late,

746
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:25,104
if the day ends, it won't be in time.

747
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:27,737
The reason I didn't send it right away

748
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:29,520
after getting the message was because…

749
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,164
If Heeyoung ends up going on

750
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,519
multiple dates,

751
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:35,833
I wanted to be the last one.

752
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,704
Because the last one is more memorable.

753
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,944
(How will they show their sincerity to
each other in the last chance that comes?)

754
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:49,494
(Dagyo and Heeyoung meet privately in the
living room before the one-on-one date.)

755
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:51,524
I've been waiting to talk to you

756
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:52,897
since yesterday,

757
00:30:53,174 --> 00:30:54,574
but you went out to stay overnight.

758
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,803
Look, I didn't even know.

759
00:31:00,804 --> 00:31:02,164
I thought I would return home

760
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:03,710
so I didn't think about that.

761
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:04,724
You have to prepare your stuff, right?

762
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,053
If I had known, I would've prepared.

763
00:31:06,054 --> 00:31:07,623
I wouldn't have been nervous.

764
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:08,764
But it ended up like that,

765
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,780
so I was very nervous.

766
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,524
When I got there,
I was asked to stay there.

767
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:12,627
Right?

768
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:14,064
I thought I would come back here.

769
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:17,434
But anyway…

770
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:21,244
I want to date you.

771
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:22,844
With me?

772
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:25,743
(Awkward)

773
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:27,823
Last time

774
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,363
you told me that.

775
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,944
It wasn't a date.

776
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:32,570
A real date is when

777
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,264
both are ready for it.

778
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:36,344
Right.

779
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:39,002
So I wanted to let you know

780
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:40,129
I'm ready now.

781
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:42,134
Really?

782
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:43,680
That's what you wanted
to say yesterday?

783
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:44,704
Mm.

784
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:46,254
You didn't come.

785
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:51,094
(Flaring)

786
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:52,287
It doesn't matter if it's a

787
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:53,567
single bed or a double bed.

788
00:31:56,654 --> 00:31:57,654
I got it.

789
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:02,573
Okay.

790
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:05,814
You look beautiful in black today.

791
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:08,964
That's why I'm wearing black.

792
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:13,064
Are you okay?

793
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:15,094
Yeah.

794
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:16,554
I'm alright.

795
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:19,833
Then before the dinner party, should we

796
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:20,893
meet one-on-one?

797
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:22,294
You see...

798
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,314
I don't know.

799
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:26,644
What will you do if there were a lot

800
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:28,351
of people who chose you?

801
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:31,844
- I don't know yet.
- It's probably a short date.

802
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:33,974
One day is way too short.

803
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:36,034
What if you had to choose?

804
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:39,233
I don't know.

805
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:41,174
I guess it's in order.

806
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:43,004
Hurry and finish dating!

807
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:47,063
I don't know...

808
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:48,014
If it's really in order,

809
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:49,150
It's probably in the order

810
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:50,220
the messages were sent.

811
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:51,661
- You think so?
- Yeah.

812
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:56,294
Got it?

813
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,553
I'll go get changed now.

814
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:01,984
Okay, go get ready.

815
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:05,404
I ran and told her,

816
00:33:05,454 --> 00:33:06,600
think about me while

817
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:08,141
dating someone else.

818
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:09,675
Because she doesn't know if she'll

819
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,020
be going on a date with me.

820
00:33:11,044 --> 00:33:12,452
She doesn't need to know that

821
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:13,720
to wait for me.

822
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:16,089
I had prepared that kind of

823
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:18,030
strategy from the beginning.

824
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,274
Your outfit looks great.

825
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:26,533
Shall we go on a date?

826
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:27,534
Sure.

827
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:30,604
- But you haven't thought about it, yes?
- Mm.

828
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:33,023
(Spraying)

829
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:34,493
Did you really spray that much?

830
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:35,644
I also want it.

831
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:38,734
Don't hit the head.

832
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:41,894
(Spraying)

833
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:43,364
Done?

834
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:46,417
I'm old. I still feel old

835
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,802
when I come here.

836
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:49,153
Right.

837
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:50,293
- Right?
- Me too.

838
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,413
You see, I, I, I...

839
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:55,273
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

840
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:56,953
I was just sympathizing.

841
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,354
Really?

842
00:34:02,094 --> 00:34:05,063
(Mirang's heart melts when it
touches Dagyo's cuteness.)

843
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,430
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

844
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,289
I was just sympathizing.

845
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,664
Sympathizing?

846
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:11,314
I didn't think you'd be upset.

847
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:13,024
Right.

848
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:15,774
So should we follow the order?

849
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:18,654
- First-come-first-served order.
- Not like that.

850
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:20,184
I misunderstood.

851
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,843
I thought it was
first-come-first-served.

852
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:24,254
I sent it quickly.

853
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,974
Really? Didn't you say you
didn't have a phone.

854
00:34:25,984 --> 00:34:26,694
You said you didn't have your phone.

855
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:28,863
I ran to find it and sent it instantly.

856
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:31,254
Oh, so that's how it is.

857
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:32,663
I didn't know.

858
00:34:32,664 --> 00:34:33,904
I got it.

859
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:37,464
Oww, I want to be the very last one.

860
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:41,614
Why do you want to be last?

861
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:43,867
Because I want the person

862
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:45,347
I date to wait for me.

863
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:47,043
(Surprised)

864
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,854
You fox!

865
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:51,644
Sly fox.

866
00:34:54,504 --> 00:34:56,073
That's why I called you to talk now.

867
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:58,654
A vicious fox.

868
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
As expected of a fox.

869
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,737
The people who likely

870
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:07,709
sent messages to Dagyo,

871
00:35:07,734 --> 00:35:10,313
if I had to guess, it's probably Mirang

872
00:35:10,314 --> 00:35:14,393
and Heeyoung.

873
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:16,633
And I think Dagyo

874
00:35:16,634 --> 00:35:19,734
probably sent a message to Heeyoung.

875
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:22,724
Yesterday, I heard from Heeyoung

876
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:25,804
that Dagyo confessed to her

877
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:27,689
that she liked her.

878
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:29,854
When I heard that,

879
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:33,264
I could guess how it would end.

880
00:35:33,984 --> 00:35:35,474
Why am I so nervous?

881
00:35:35,804 --> 00:35:36,634
Huh? What?

882
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,884
Why am I this nervous?

883
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:40,314
Because it's a date.

884
00:35:40,624 --> 00:35:43,553
Dates are supposed to make you nervous.

885
00:35:43,554 --> 00:35:46,553
Because I date when I want to.

886
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:47,514
Right now, you're nervous.

887
00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:48,414
This is the first time

888
00:35:48,424 --> 00:35:49,670
as soon as you saw her face,

889
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:51,091
the mood appeared, right?

890
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:53,203
You're just nervous.

891
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:55,764
Hey, but you're doing so well.

892
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:57,034
Actually,

893
00:35:58,764 --> 00:35:59,963
What would happen if a date
you don't want to go on

894
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,220
turns out to be so good
that you're shaking all over?

895
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:02,144
You want to run away?

896
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:03,428
Because I also have feelings for a date

897
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,374
that I don't want to go on.

898
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,654
See? See?

899
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,394
I knew you'd want to run away.

900
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:07,440
If you keep doing this,

901
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,731
it will become a habit.

902
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,524
If it weren't like that,
it'd be really good.

903
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:12,674
You're my competition too, I'm just

904
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:14,359
criticizing everything objectively.

905
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:16,193
That's true.

906
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:18,064
I came here to overcome that.

907
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:22,433
But this is driving me crazy.

908
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:23,763
- You just...
- Well,

909
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,933
just do what you always do, okay?

910
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:26,804
Or you have to adjust a bit.

911
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:27,774
Adjust?

912
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:29,833
Show a new side of you,
when it's just the two of you,

913
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:30,794
Ah, okay.

914
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:32,094
So when you're with other people

915
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:34,193
or in a group, I change a lot.

916
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,307
When you do something

917
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:36,320
with someone you like,

918
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,933
you should show it.

919
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:38,895
I'm someone who do this

920
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,454
to someone I like.

921
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:42,333
This is your chance to show it.

922
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,494
You must show it.

923
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:47,503
I'm so nervous, I feel all tingly.

924
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:48,704
Want a massage?

925
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,274
No thanks.

926
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:51,734
Instead of choosing

927
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:53,244
the hopeless option because

928
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,628
you have no chance

929
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:56,216
I think it's better to have the chance

930
00:36:56,236 --> 00:36:57,392
to talk to everyone you want to date.

931
00:36:57,416 --> 00:37:00,243
And I think it's a good way

932
00:37:00,244 --> 00:37:01,848
to pick the ones

933
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:03,350
you're most interested in.

934
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:07,164
That's why I'm sincerely treating Dagyo

935
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,593
with the best I can offer right now.

936
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,494
And I hope everyone else does the same.

937
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:14,093
But now I'm a little worried.

938
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:15,774
Worried?

939
00:37:15,784 --> 00:37:17,173
I'm also waiting.

940
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:18,653
Right.

941
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,464
I must go on a date today.

942
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:23,680
This depends on how long

943
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:25,065
we have to wait.

944
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:28,463
(Nods)

945
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:30,204
I'd do anything for a date,
this is a war.

946
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,894
Then I probably won't see Mirang again.

947
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:33,954
Mirang did everything

948
00:37:33,964 --> 00:37:34,884
well.

949
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,407
I will never neglect anything

950
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:38,028
that shows her my feelings.

951
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:40,053
What is Mirang doing?

952
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:41,740
You look worried about Mirang...

953
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:42,959
How should I put it?

954
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:44,374
Must be a little worried.

955
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:48,343
Aren't you going to tell Dagyo?

956
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:50,223
- But I got caught.
- I guess so.

957
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:51,913
I'll go for it openly.

958
00:37:51,914 --> 00:37:55,213
But Mirang knows my feelings too.

959
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:56,434
Oh...

960
00:37:57,594 --> 00:37:58,894
(Haha)

961
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:04,153
Are you scared?

962
00:38:04,154 --> 00:38:05,934
I'm scared. I'll admit it!

963
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:08,834
(Very scared)

964
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:10,339
How come!

965
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:15,864
(Will their hearts change after
their last one-on-one conversation?)

966
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:18,074
I'll go first.

967
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:20,014
- Have a good trip.
- Good luck.

968
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,394
So you're going to split up like that!

969
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:24,684
Seriously...

970
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:27,063
I'll try the fastest way.

971
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,304
(On guard)
Dagyo got the most date requests, right?

972
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:31,724
So cute! I want to know more now.

973
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:32,724
No.

974
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:37,014
Dagyo,

975
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,337
she must have ended up going

976
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:39,397
on three dates today.

977
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:43,284
It could happen.

978
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:47,643
The one who went out first was Dagyo.

979
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:49,543
And being first out probably

980
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,523
means she got the most picks.

981
00:38:52,524 --> 00:38:54,453
Whether it's first or second,

982
00:38:54,454 --> 00:38:55,644
she's definitely going on

983
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:56,869
a date with me.

984
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,654
When we go on that date,

985
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:01,457
I believe Dagyo will enjoy

986
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:02,920
our time together

987
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:05,104
more and more.

988
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:13,394
(The girls leave Together House
with their hearts beating fast.)

989
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:16,993
(The last person left was
Mirang after everyone had left.)

990
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:18,243
Two days ago, when it was

991
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:19,780
just the two of us,

992
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:21,443
Dagyo and I had a deep conversation,

993
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:22,844
And I told her

994
00:39:22,854 --> 00:39:26,053
not to go on a date with Heeyoung.

995
00:39:26,054 --> 00:39:27,374
So I trusted Dagyo.

996
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,880
I really thought Dagyo

997
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:30,972
would pick me, no matter what.

998
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:34,876
(Calm waves)

999
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:38,067
(And the wind blows gently)

1000
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:43,257
(A certain someone is waiting for someone)

1001
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:46,027
(Dagyo's date)

1002
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:54,013
(Who will be the first to go on
a one-on-one date with Dagyo?)

1003
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:09,857
Dagyo.

1004
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,606
So you're here.

1005
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:15,306
You know I chose you?

1006
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:17,157
Huh? Just a guess...

1007
00:40:17,177 --> 00:40:19,026
I've wanted to try dating you before.

1008
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:20,187
Really?

1009
00:40:23,132 --> 00:40:25,652
So, Seoyeon came first, huh?

1010
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:27,746
I already knew she had written letters.

1011
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:30,796
And not just once,

1012
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:32,656
she sent several.

1013
00:40:32,657 --> 00:40:33,850
If sending a letter meant you

1014
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,023
automatically got to go on a date,

1015
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,036
maybe she just wanted to
talk with me once.

1016
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:38,526
I also wanted to talk to her.

1017
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:39,546
But when I came in,

1018
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:40,967
Dagyo's face

1019
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:43,316
looked very surprised.

1020
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:46,367
Like she knew,

1021
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,646
But she looks a little shy.

1022
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:51,356
And maybe a little nervous too.

1023
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:52,903
Maybe it was the kind of nervousness

1024
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,273
that comes with shyness.

1025
00:40:54,297 --> 00:40:56,227
I realized I wasn't

1026
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:58,061
the only one nervous here.

1027
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:01,266
Even though I was nervous,

1028
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:03,197
I thought, I must express myself well.

1029
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:05,856
So I sat down carefully and mindfully.

1030
00:41:05,857 --> 00:41:08,136
I was seriously so nervous.

1031
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:11,336
It's our first date, you know?

1032
00:41:11,337 --> 00:41:12,387
Mm.

1033
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:16,810
You must be surprised that

1034
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,363
I sent the message so soon.

1035
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:21,646
Mm...

1036
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:22,796
Not really.

1037
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:24,096
- You weren't surprised?
- Mm.

1038
00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:25,306
You already knew?

1039
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:26,356
(Nods)

1040
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:29,716
Because when we do everything together,

1041
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:32,546
That day, we misunderstood the rules,

1042
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:35,027
and you said something to me then.

1043
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,667
Will you go on a date with me?

1044
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:39,437
Huh? Do you mean it?

1045
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,086
Is it possible?

1046
00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:41,897
(Seoyeon's true feelings that
was misunderstood(?)) Huh?

1047
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:42,897
Wait, the winning team.

1048
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:47,546
Back then, actually,

1049
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,776
I felt pressured.

1050
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:51,256
I lost my rationality.

1051
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:54,026
I just acted on instinct.

1052
00:41:54,027 --> 00:41:55,100
I just blurted it out

1053
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:56,403
while talking to you,

1054
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:57,797
and I was like, 'huh?' I said it.

1055
00:41:58,653 --> 00:41:59,953
Ah, so that's what happened.

1056
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,111
You already knew.

1057
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:03,326
But when you said that,

1058
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:05,796
it was a very surprising memory.

1059
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:07,627
Oh, you first realized that then?

1060
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:09,777
No, not really.

1061
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:11,786
Did she send me a letter?'

1062
00:42:11,787 --> 00:42:13,117
That's when I realized.

1063
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,176
Do you know how many I sent?

1064
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,636
That is...

1065
00:42:17,637 --> 00:42:19,357
a secret.

1066
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,576
You sent me a lot, didn't you?

1067
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:22,717
- Mm.
- Really?

1068
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,347
But why didn't you show it at all?

1069
00:42:28,997 --> 00:42:33,117
First of all, you and Mirang,

1070
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:35,796
you two seemed so solid.

1071
00:42:35,797 --> 00:42:36,877
Mm, I see.

1072
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:39,996
You really looked like a firm couple,

1073
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:41,110
so I thought there's no way

1074
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:42,133
I can step in here.

1075
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:45,197
'I must not be Dagyo's type.'

1076
00:42:45,787 --> 00:42:47,236
That's what I thought.

1077
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:49,826
Why would you think that?

1078
00:42:49,827 --> 00:42:51,287
My hair is long,

1079
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:53,373
my style is the complete

1080
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,348
opposite of Mirang.

1081
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:56,526
Don't worry about long hair.

1082
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:57,596
Really?

1083
00:42:57,597 --> 00:42:59,176
The person I was curious about

1084
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,916
wasn't just Mirang, you know?

1085
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,336
I can't say who it was,

1086
00:43:02,337 --> 00:43:04,136
Anyway, when I saw people

1087
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:05,786
with short hair, it was only Mirang.

1088
00:43:05,787 --> 00:43:07,617
I just wanted to tell you

1089
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,246
not to worry about stuff like that.

1090
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:11,727
(Relieved)
- Oh.
- Please feel at ease.

1091
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:17,096
I still want to date you.

1092
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,906
If I had another chance, I'd sign up.

1093
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:19,597
I've made up my mind.

1094
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,546
But at that time,
we didn't cook together.

1095
00:43:21,547 --> 00:43:22,987
Yes, we were supposed

1096
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,593
to cook dinner together.

1097
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:26,787
Yesterday, who did you eat dinner with?

1098
00:43:27,787 --> 00:43:28,887
Riwon.

1099
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:32,317
I felt kind of bummed about that.

1100
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:35,416
I wanted to cook with you just once.

1101
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:36,966
Because you said

1102
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,427
you wanted to go on a date with me,

1103
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,612
but we didn't get to.

1104
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,097
Because I went on a foursome date.

1105
00:43:42,157 --> 00:43:44,183
I thought 'It'd be nice

1106
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,861
to at least cook together.'

1107
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:48,606
But I ended up going out.

1108
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,287
I was kind of disappointed too.

1109
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:52,497
I wanted to talk with you.

1110
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:57,297
I'm curious though,

1111
00:43:57,322 --> 00:43:58,536
why did you pair me up

1112
00:43:58,561 --> 00:43:59,810
with Mirang as roommates?

1113
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:05,086
During the sketchbook thing,

1114
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:06,481
(Paying attention)
It felt like I confirmed

1115
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:07,773
just by seeing it.

1116
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:10,606
Can't guess what I wrote there?

1117
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,786
Mm, everyone was close

1118
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:16,806
and sharing their thoughts anyway.

1119
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:17,557
So

1120
00:44:17,558 --> 00:44:19,433
I figured you had your

1121
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:20,744
own reasons for it.

1122
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:21,487
Oh.

1123
00:44:21,488 --> 00:44:22,887
(I see...)

1124
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,206
You looked so solid…

1125
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,596
And since Mirang and I shared a room,

1126
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:31,346
I heard a lot about how she felt too.

1127
00:44:31,347 --> 00:44:32,866
The relationship between the two of you,

1128
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:35,477
was much deeper than I thought.

1129
00:44:35,497 --> 00:44:36,917
Both are caring for each other...

1130
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:39,377
And...

1131
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:42,166
I just thought,
'I guess I have to give up.'

1132
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,676
What were you two talking about?

1133
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:45,436
I was just wondering about that.

1134
00:44:45,437 --> 00:44:46,696
When did you talk about that

1135
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:47,990
and how many days

1136
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:49,444
did you talk about that?

1137
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:50,750
I think it was the day before

1138
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,783
we changed rooms.

1139
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:54,376
Maybe it's because you left too

1140
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:55,777
so I want to keep seeing your face.

1141
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:58,076
I missed and wanted to meet you.

1142
00:44:58,077 --> 00:45:00,046
She already told you about that, huh?

1143
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:01,637
I even dreamt about you too.

1144
00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:06,166
But you still like me.

1145
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:07,567
How come...

1146
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,496
Honestly,

1147
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:11,827
I used to really

1148
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:13,957
liked Mirang before.

1149
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:17,356
(Halts)

1150
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:18,703
I normally hate

1151
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:20,461
being dependent on people,

1152
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,566
but with her we talked a lot,

1153
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:24,207
shared our concerns…

1154
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,453
Even though I started

1155
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:28,493
developing feelings for her,

1156
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,041
it's in a sense that

1157
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:31,562
I wanted to rely on her,

1158
00:45:31,587 --> 00:45:32,936
and grow closer.

1159
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:34,566
So there's that kind of thing.

1160
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:36,936
So I didn't want her to hate me either.

1161
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:39,266
Mm, I get it.

1162
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:41,467
Because I didn't want her to hate me.

1163
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,327
I really didn't want her to dislike me.

1164
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,036
You like older or younger partner?

1165
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,007
(Seoyeon and Mirang talked a lot in
the first episode at Together House.)

1166
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:50,127
Originally, I've always

1167
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,667
liked older people,

1168
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:53,137
but right now, there aren't

1169
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:54,653
many older ones around…

1170
00:45:54,677 --> 00:45:55,786
Mm, that must be hard to accept.

1171
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,436
(The reason Seoyeon watched
their relationship from a distance)

1172
00:45:58,437 --> 00:45:59,687
It's funny.

1173
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:01,616
(Seoyeon, who didn't want to
hurt Mirang, whom she liked.)

1174
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:04,256
- Just kidding.
- Seriously, you...

1175
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:07,076
So that's how it is...

1176
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,447
You have to fight for it.

1177
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:11,006
I thought about fighting for it.

1178
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:14,267
But I don't see an opportunity.

1179
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:16,457
I see.

1180
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,397
Nervous?

1181
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:22,067
You...

1182
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:28,586
Do you like someone with my style...

1183
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:30,526
or not?

1184
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:32,297
Do you not like it?

1185
00:46:35,717 --> 00:46:37,077
No, that's not it.

1186
00:46:37,677 --> 00:46:38,707
Really?

1187
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:40,976
At first,

1188
00:46:40,977 --> 00:46:42,203
I was confused as to whether you

1189
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,298
have feelings for me or not

1190
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:44,956
during breakfast.

1191
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:46,157
When you first asked me if

1192
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,063
I cared about “preferences”, remember?

1193
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:49,187
Mm.

1194
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:53,496
Are characteristics important?

1195
00:46:53,497 --> 00:46:55,086
Characteristics?

1196
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:56,573
It's not important.

1197
00:46:56,594 --> 00:46:58,123
But the first time I asked them,

1198
00:46:58,147 --> 00:46:59,776
they said it's not important.

1199
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:01,106
But I'm the same.

1200
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:01,967
(Seoyeon cautiously
shows interest in Dagyo.)

1201
00:47:01,968 --> 00:47:03,886
I was confused when I heard that

1202
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:04,936
in our beginning.

1203
00:47:04,937 --> 00:47:07,766
Even though I

1204
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:09,336
don't care about this kind of thing.

1205
00:47:09,337 --> 00:47:10,923
But I wonder if you want to

1206
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,483
know about me or not.

1207
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:13,766
I want to know about that.

1208
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:15,007
It's so confusing.

1209
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,276
Just by saying something on your mind,

1210
00:47:17,277 --> 00:47:20,616
we're all a little bit delusional.

1211
00:47:20,617 --> 00:47:21,626
You just said what's on your mind,

1212
00:47:21,627 --> 00:47:25,707
I was like 'what did that mean?'

1213
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:28,116
If it were me, I'd only ask

1214
00:47:28,117 --> 00:47:29,816
someone I'm interested in.

1215
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:30,787
Mm, right.

1216
00:47:30,812 --> 00:47:32,183
Because I didn't think

1217
00:47:32,204 --> 00:47:33,804
you wanted to know.

1218
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:35,766
Yeah, that's why I asked

1219
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,893
if it was important

1220
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:39,037
because I have feelings for you.

1221
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:41,826
That's why I said

1222
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,696
it didn't matter.

1223
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:46,367
I should've just gone for it back then.

1224
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:50,036
Well at least now we get to talk,

1225
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,696
because even just once,

1226
00:47:51,697 --> 00:47:53,167
we got to spend time one-on-one.

1227
00:47:57,607 --> 00:48:00,996
My first impression pick was Heeyoung,

1228
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:04,086
but after that, gradually,

1229
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:05,607
I became interested in you.

1230
00:48:06,377 --> 00:48:07,817
Why?

1231
00:48:12,337 --> 00:48:14,187
Because I like you.

1232
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:15,177
(Shy)

1233
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:19,797
I wonder how I'm being seen.

1234
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:21,866
I really can't guess.

1235
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:23,596
Before coming here,

1236
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:25,396
I assumed I wouldn't be popular.

1237
00:48:25,397 --> 00:48:28,327
So this feels really surprising.

1238
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,586
I thought I'd be super popular,

1239
00:48:30,587 --> 00:48:32,856
(Joking)
but I'm not...

1240
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:35,456
No, why do you think that?

1241
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:38,767
I only got two letters until now.

1242
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:44,216
Still, before this ended, I thought

1243
00:48:44,217 --> 00:48:45,810
it would be nice to

1244
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,510
talk to you like this.

1245
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:49,117
Me too, me too.

1246
00:48:49,118 --> 00:48:51,746
I wish we had that kind of time too.

1247
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:52,846
Really?

1248
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:53,873
Because you said

1249
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,293
you had feelings for me,

1250
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:56,686
so I really wanted to know

1251
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,447
what kind of feelings you had for me.

1252
00:48:59,387 --> 00:49:01,426
You're so pretty,

1253
00:49:01,427 --> 00:49:02,367
(Shy)

1254
00:49:02,368 --> 00:49:03,927
and I think we have

1255
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:05,887
a similar taste in food, too.

1256
00:49:06,797 --> 00:49:09,466
I think you like peace,

1257
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:11,106
and our personalities are similar.

1258
00:49:11,107 --> 00:49:12,686
You were really observant.

1259
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:14,847
Of course. I was watching you.

1260
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:20,146
I really like that personality.

1261
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:21,573
I thought our personalities

1262
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:22,638
matched well.

1263
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:25,667
But.

1264
00:49:26,887 --> 00:49:29,060
But I ended up saying it just now.

1265
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,087
And

1266
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:32,357
you're really pretty.

1267
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:34,096
Thanks.

1268
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:35,097
You're pretty too!

1269
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:39,146
(Shy)

1270
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:40,946
But today you came to tell me like this.

1271
00:49:40,947 --> 00:49:42,076
Will it be okay?

1272
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:43,736
You won't regret, right?

1273
00:49:43,737 --> 00:49:45,487
Yeah, I won't regret it.

1274
00:49:46,387 --> 00:49:47,507
The reason I say

1275
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:49,125
I won't regret it is because

1276
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,139
I'd been hiding my feelings

1277
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:52,964
for Dagyo this whole time.

1278
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:56,676
She talked about everything so smoothly

1279
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:58,457
and it reached my heart.

1280
00:49:59,107 --> 00:50:00,613
Now the accumulated stress

1281
00:50:00,627 --> 00:50:01,823
has eased a lot.

1282
00:50:01,847 --> 00:50:04,916
I put in a lot of effort

1283
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:07,527
to make that effort a success.

1284
00:50:08,477 --> 00:50:13,467
That's the reason why I confessed.

1285
00:50:14,497 --> 00:50:17,457
So I have no regrets.

1286
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:20,136
I'm satisfied overall.

1287
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:22,530
Because it's a date

1288
00:50:22,544 --> 00:50:24,452
that both of us wanted.

1289
00:50:24,477 --> 00:50:27,367
Today, I feel like I got to understand

1290
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,832
her feelings more.

1291
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:38,686
(The one-on-one date time is over,
Dagyo, please go to the next date.)

1292
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:39,817
It's over.

1293
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,916
That was short, huh?

1294
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:44,087
Mm.

1295
00:50:44,387 --> 00:50:45,406
We didn't get to talk that much.

1296
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:47,127
We didn't even drink much.

1297
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,667
Let's drink a little more first.

1298
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,906
I think I'm a little busy.

1299
00:50:51,907 --> 00:50:53,427
Because you're popular.

1300
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:55,627
It's really not like that.

1301
00:50:56,927 --> 00:50:58,000
I'll leave the thing

1302
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:59,180
you gave me here too.

1303
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,506
Your love...

1304
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:06,327
Whoever it is, I hope it works out.

1305
00:51:06,787 --> 00:51:09,507
I also want the love you sent me.

1306
00:51:10,807 --> 00:51:11,927
I wanted to tell you that

1307
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,143
you were really cool.

1308
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,207
Thank you so much.

1309
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:16,506
(Seoyeon who reveals her feelings
even though it's too late) Mm, good luck.

1310
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:17,797
I have to go on another date...

1311
00:51:17,997 --> 00:51:18,827
Because you're popular.

1312
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:21,406
No... But I really enjoyed it

1313
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:23,377
- I enjoyed it too.
- Talking with you like this.

1314
00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:25,586
You're my first girl.

1315
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:26,766
(Dagyo is Seoyeon's first official girl)

1316
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:28,397
That's right.

1317
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:32,106
I'm officially your first girl.

1318
00:51:32,107 --> 00:51:35,416
I'm taking that title, sorry.

1319
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:36,107
Take care.

1320
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:38,067
I should get going first.

1321
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,676
- Bye bye.
- See you back at the house later.

1322
00:51:42,677 --> 00:51:45,387
(Dagyo and Seoyeon's
one-on-one date has ended.)

1323
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:56,887
(Heeyoung is waiting for her date)

1324
00:51:58,627 --> 00:52:03,307
(Who is Heeyoung's one-on-one date?)

1325
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:08,306
(Minwoo signs up for a
one-on-one date with Heeyoung)

1326
00:52:08,307 --> 00:52:10,747
Today was our last date,

1327
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:13,166
and honestly, it meant a lot to me.

1328
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,576
To Heeyoung,

1329
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:17,207
My goal was just to tell my story.

1330
00:52:21,293 --> 00:52:22,167
Hi.

1331
00:52:22,168 --> 00:52:23,327
Aren't you cold?

1332
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:25,466
Nope, but the weather's so nice.

1333
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:26,607
Is the weather nice?

1334
00:52:30,307 --> 00:52:31,616
Today,

1335
00:52:31,617 --> 00:52:33,276
- Huh?
- We're like

1336
00:52:33,277 --> 00:52:34,717
black and white.

1337
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,419
Oh, you're right.

1338
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,176
(Both of them wore black and
white outfits as if they had planned it.)

1339
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:45,999
(Sheepishly)

1340
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,480
Did you get to say what you wanted?

1341
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,909
Say what?

1342
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,119
With other people who
you want to talk to.

1343
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,039
If you want to talk to them again.

1344
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,389
You said before you wanted to try.

1345
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,660
Mm...

1346
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,580
Still not interested?

1347
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:04,050
From the beginning,

1348
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:05,949
I think I never really had

1349
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,510
that kind of chance.

1350
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,140
It all felt a little

1351
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:10,765
overwhelming for me.

1352
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,940
(Nods)

1353
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:13,080
Yesterday,

1354
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,640
I just expressed my feelings.

1355
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,103
I usually don't express myself

1356
00:53:18,123 --> 00:53:20,363
if we didn't sit down
and talk like this.

1357
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,720
It must be that feeling

1358
00:53:21,728 --> 00:53:23,661
on the last day of selection

1359
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:28,689
that all my efforts

1360
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:29,900
were in vain.

1361
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,379
It's me, Minwoo.

1362
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,029
(Last night, Minwoo told her
feelings over the phone.)

1363
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,649
Where are you? What are you doing?

1364
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,379
I'm just in my room.

1365
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,919
I waited for the call a long time.

1366
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,500
Mm.

1367
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,619
I had my phone on while doing stuff.

1368
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,079
But it didn't come, and honestly,

1369
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,400
I got a little annoyed.

1370
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,900
And I don't have that cool style.

1371
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,090
I was really jealous.

1372
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,699
(I see)
But I just held it in.

1373
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,300
I tried to match your pace.

1374
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,920
(Heeyoung looks back quietly on yesterday.)

1375
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,229
(Minwoo becomes more clear with Heeyoung)
I should have expressed myself

1376
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,430
more clearly today.

1377
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,169
Coming to the together house,

1378
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,929
I still don't understand

1379
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:17,690
what everyone is thinking.

1380
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,660
Now that I see it,

1381
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,736
I feel it a bit because

1382
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,430
that's the kind of personality I have.

1383
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,700
That's right.

1384
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,800
But now that I've started to

1385
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:28,605
understand you a little.

1386
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:30,349
What I noticed is that

1387
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,665
a lot of people expresses love

1388
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,716
in a similar way.

1389
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,620
They're super cautious,

1390
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:35,129
and hide their feelings
from the other person.

1391
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,019
There are many people like this.

1392
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,570
- Something like that.
- Mm.. Besides what you did to me,

1393
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,169
when I see other people,

1394
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,389
there are a lot of 'things like this'.

1395
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,770
I don't have that feeling at all.

1396
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,869
Because I'm not open to
something like that.

1397
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:53,610
Right.

1398
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:54,763
Maybe you couldn't help

1399
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:55,866
but feel irritated that

1400
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,779
you couldn't reach me on the phone

1401
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,350
- just to expressed your feelings to me.
- That's right.

1402
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:05,069
So I talked to you yesterday

1403
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,889
and I felt like I liked you more.

1404
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,996
If you had send me

1405
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:11,855
another thank-you note,

1406
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,209
I'd be even more confused.

1407
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,230
At first, I didn't really know you well.

1408
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,390
It's surprising that you

1409
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,026
didn't show any reaction.

1410
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,331
At first, I wasn't interested

1411
00:55:22,345 --> 00:55:23,545
in you at all.

1412
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,410
(Really?)

1413
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:26,279
I didn't even expect

1414
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,109
hat I'd become interested

1415
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,299
not even 0.5%.

1416
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,489
What was that percent?

1417
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,970
When we did the go kart game.

1418
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,609
(Realized that I had feelings for Heeyoung even though it was too late.) - I know, I know.
- Okay, okay. That was it.

1419
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:39,999
During the game?

1420
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,420
Yes, when you played the game,

1421
00:55:41,445 --> 00:55:42,654
you did very well,

1422
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,109
and now I really like your look.

1423
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,469
Seeing how happy and excited you were,

1424
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,749
Until that look, it made me see
how charming you were.

1425
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,636
From that moment until now,

1426
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:52,639
you've looked pretty to me.

1427
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,539
Ah, so that was the point, huh?

1428
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,080
Then we won and went on a date together.

1429
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,369
I see.

1430
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:59,530
So I used a lot of tricks to

1431
00:55:59,555 --> 00:56:01,151
try to stay close to you.

1432
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,100
I planned it.

1433
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:03,249
Oh.

1434
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,089
But if I was too obvious,

1435
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,299
I knew you'd be like,

1436
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,399
“Why?” because of your personality.

1437
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,062
I'm not the type of person who wants

1438
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,290
to open up and tell my feelings.

1439
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,340
Oh...

1440
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,219
So I just naturally kept

1441
00:56:17,244 --> 00:56:18,613
sticking around you.

1442
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,619
(Uneasy)

1443
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,709
I don't think our pace

1444
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,219
matches super well.

1445
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,233
But I'm really thankful that

1446
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:32,933
you tried to match mine.

1447
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,288
I just wanted to express

1448
00:56:34,315 --> 00:56:35,995
my feelings honestly.

1449
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,670
Yeah, that's really cool of you.

1450
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,460
If you change your mind,

1451
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,560
please contact me

1452
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,250
after the show ends.

1453
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,029
I felt a bit better on today's date.

1454
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,943
Whether the answer was

1455
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,366
positive or negative,

1456
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,989
I was just glad

1457
00:56:57,996 --> 00:56:59,730
I got to say what I felt.

1458
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,536
And with the camellia flowers

1459
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,441
in the background and Heeyoung.

1460
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:04,556
Plus, I get to see your

1461
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:06,076
beautiful smile too.

1462
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:07,960
I liked her because she looked pretty.

1463
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,790
Huh?

1464
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,219
(The one-on-one date has ended.)

1465
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,430
It's over.

1466
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,430
Let's go.

1467
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,679
Did you like it?

1468
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,699
I really liked it.

1469
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,700
Me too.

1470
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,800
I liked it a lot.

1471
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,100
(Hate)

1472
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,860
Let's get to work.

1473
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,600
(While everyone is on a date)

1474
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,700
(Mirang accidentally
falls asleep while waiting)

1475
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,399
(Minwoo comes in after the date
with Heeyoung ends)

1476
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
(Bam!)

1477
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,919
(Hahahaha)

1478
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,209
Why did you come back so early?

1479
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:04,930
Huh?

1480
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,069
Isn't it too early?

1481
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:07,236
Because I was in a hurry,

1482
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:08,626
I came back in a hurry.

1483
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:09,650
Why?

1484
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,559
Who did you go with?

1485
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,149
I went with Heeyoung.

1486
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,339
The date is over?

1487
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:15,900
Mm.

1488
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,719
I only have Heeyoung.

1489
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,070
Did it go well?

1490
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,209
We had a good conversation...

1491
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,250
Even if it's not mutual,

1492
00:58:23,277 --> 00:58:24,423
I'm okay with that.

1493
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,499
Right.

1494
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,819
What were you doing?

1495
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,299
I was just lying here the whole time.

1496
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,449
You didn't go out?

1497
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,580
Mm.

1498
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:32,930
Oh...

1499
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,799
You didn't write Dagyo's name, right?

1500
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,740
(Nods)

1501
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:38,513
Yeah. Earlier, Riwon came

1502
00:58:38,538 --> 00:58:39,898
by for a second,

1503
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,223
Heeyoung declares that she will

1504
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,170
fight with all her heart for Dagyo.

1505
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,869
So, Heeyoung likes Dagyo?

1506
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,519
I don't know if she likes her,

1507
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,379
This is what they're doing.

1508
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,539
I remember when they went
on a one-on-one date,

1509
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,839
we changed roommates.

1510
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,159
Ah, right, right.

1511
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,186
I'm sure they had

1512
00:58:58,207 --> 00:58:59,526
some sort of talk then.

1513
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:03,629
Since then, I noticed Heeyoung

1514
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,329
taking care of Dagyo.

1515
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,930
Because I happened to see from the side.

1516
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,296
I think the unexpected

1517
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,636
variable is Heeyoung.

1518
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,189
Heeyoung and Dagyo.

1519
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,859
They must have been curious about

1520
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,659
something to end up like that.

1521
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,180
Heeyoung even told me that

1522
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,229
'if she gets a chance to get
to know someone else'

1523
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,109
and also 'I must find an answer.'

1524
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,140
If there was no one else,

1525
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,370
I don't think she would've said that.

1526
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,699
I think Dagyo still has a

1527
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,190
lingering curiosity about Heeyoung.

1528
00:59:34,215 --> 00:59:35,323
I wonder if she still has

1529
00:59:35,343 --> 00:59:36,343
feelings for her.

1530
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,900
(Mirang came in second)

1531
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,160
Hey.

1532
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:44,880
You're back.

1533
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:45,979
Mm.

1534
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,859
Huh? Why did you come over here?

1535
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,029
I was here by myself the whole time.

1536
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,359
I just came to eat.

1537
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,389
Where? Where were you all alone?

1538
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,709
In that room.

1539
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:54,610
There's no one there?

1540
00:59:54,611 --> 00:59:56,350
I've just been alone.

1541
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:58,769
Then Minwoo and Jinah just came in.

1542
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,229
I was so hungry.

1543
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,109
Please eat this. I made it.

1544
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:03,110
Mm! Nice.

1545
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:04,350
Thank you, thank you.

1546
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,310
Eat it with kimchi stew.

1547
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,739
How was yesterday?

1548
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,590
Yesterday?

1549
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:12,650
It was fun.

1550
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,639
Please enjoy your meal.

1551
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,660
Thank you.

1552
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,049
The rice is still hot.

1553
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,050
Mm...

1554
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,910
(Great!)

1555
01:00:20,911 --> 01:00:22,869
Riwon made that kimchi stew.

1556
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,350
- It's really delicious.
- Really?

1557
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,380
It's so good.

1558
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:26,403
How should I put it?

1559
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,686
It tastes like home-cooked food.

1560
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,620
You know right?

1561
01:00:28,621 --> 01:00:30,096
Being good at making tasty food

1562
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:31,561
for one's partner.

1563
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,029
Oh...

1564
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,470
She definitely has done it a lot before.

1565
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,039
But I think she'll

1566
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,240
take good care of her partner.

1567
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:39,755
I do my best.

1568
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,770
(Haa...)

1569
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,200
(Heavy heart)
You seem nervous.

1570
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,480
Huh? Mm...

1571
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,780
You already know, right?

1572
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,689
About

1573
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,010
choosing Dagyo today?

1574
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,839
It's war.

1575
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,709
(Aye) (Snap)

1576
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:04,330
But I don't care about

1577
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,610
you choosing Dagyo.

1578
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:08,979
Besides, we're all here,

1579
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,123
everyone here is looking

1580
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:11,236
for someone to date,

1581
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,466
I just hope everyone does

1582
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:15,107
whatever they want and

1583
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,649
follows their heart with no regrets.

1584
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,739
- I totally agree with that.
- Don't care what other people think.

1585
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,870
Even if someone is watching me,

1586
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,758
I'll do whatever I want, whether

1587
01:01:22,785 --> 01:01:24,416
it's a competition or anything.

1588
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,399
We're here to do

1589
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
what we want.

1590
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,000
Exactly.

1591
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:30,241
Since it's been done like that,

1592
01:01:30,985 --> 01:01:32,375
I should do the same for myself.

1593
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,690
I've never seen this side of me before.

1594
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,940
This time, I've changed a bit.

1595
01:01:37,145 --> 01:01:39,386
Because I understand

1596
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:41,185
what my heart wants.

1597
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,169
You know the situation already.

1598
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,170
Mm.

1599
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,110
Even though I knew it was like that,

1600
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,076
the outcome would've
turned out different

1601
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,420
if I hadn't done anything at all.

1602
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:51,255
Situations like this happen all the time

1603
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,590
so there's no way I could just fake it.

1604
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,860
That's true.

1605
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,149
But it seems that today

1606
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,350
is the first time I've done

1607
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,916
what I wanted to do first.

1608
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,330
Did you think beforehand?

1609
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:03,850
A date that both parties

1610
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,395
want to do together.

1611
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:05,890
(Both parties?)

1612
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:07,460
A mutual date.

1613
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,396
So today is about getting

1614
01:02:12,421 --> 01:02:13,787
to know each other better.

1615
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,260
I didn't know it would be like this.

1616
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:16,500
I realized it too late now.

1617
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,229
'Oh, so that's how it is!'

1618
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,980
Now, let's wait and see.

1619
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,039
Because this is how you've acted

1620
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,319
since we've known each other until now.

1621
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,989
I believe I have to fight harder.

1622
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,019
But now, something new has happened.

1623
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,910
It's possible.

1624
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,380
So really, we don't know how it'll go.

1625
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,030
Right, we really don't know.

1626
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,420
So you, just keep showing all

1627
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:37,330
the charm you've been showing so far.

1628
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,270
I do it my way.

1629
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,050
And it should work.

1630
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,210
Yeah.

1631
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,580
Now, the choice is really up to Dagyo.

1632
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,779
But you never know. I just realized now,

1633
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,120
I might not be the one.

1634
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,870
It might not be Dagyo either.

1635
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,260
But there's one thing.

1636
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,990
Dagyo and I made a promise.

1637
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,060
If today doesn't go that way,

1638
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,210
then I'm not sure what to do.

1639
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,016
I think it will affect

1640
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,346
the final decision.

1641
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:09,349
Even your final choice.

1642
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,350
Mm.

1643
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,129
(Confused)

1644
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,370
To me, that's really important.

1645
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:19,159
You're not going to tell me
what the promise was.

1646
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,160
Mm.

1647
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,480
Ah, the promise?

1648
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,160
I'm so curious.

1649
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:30,360
It must be complicated for you.

1650
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,520
Everyone's coming back.

1651
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:37,489
Maybe I misunderstood,

1652
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:39,469
but Heeyoung said

1653
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:40,889
it was the first time

1654
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,039
she secretly liked someone.

1655
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,859
When I heard that,

1656
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,040
I...

1657
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:49,619
I remembered a promise
I made with Dagyo.

1658
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,980
But if Dagyo broke it,

1659
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,579
I'd feel so betrayed

1660
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,810
and really hurt.

1661
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,400
(Worried)(Anxious)

1662
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,509
(Mirang's expression isn't very good.)

1663
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,800
Wait, wait.

1664
01:04:02,825 --> 01:04:04,256
I thought I saw the two of them

1665
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:05,436
talking a while ago.

1666
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,150
Oh.

1667
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,800
(Staggering)

1668
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:16,349
(Dagyo prepares for the next date)

1669
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,690
Did you have a good time?

1670
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,670
Yes. It was fun.

1671
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,540
But my cheeks turned so red.

1672
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,309
Why are they so red?

1673
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,423
I must have been allergic

1674
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,124
to something this morning,

1675
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,750
it flared up like this.

1676
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,070
Just go out like that.

1677
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:35,580
Go out like this?

1678
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,320
It's like you used a blush on.

1679
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:37,420
It flared up like this,

1680
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,706
it doesn't look like a blush on.

1681
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:39,875
No, you're already pretty.

1682
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,908
You look good.

1683
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,930
(Frowning)

1684
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,180
But why did you come back?

1685
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,170
Huh?

1686
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,000
Why did you come back?

1687
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,186
Been home for a while.

1688
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,130
Really?

1689
01:04:52,131 --> 01:04:53,150
I'll go.

1690
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,900
(After Dagyo left, Mirang sat there
lost in her thoughts.)

1691
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,199
But really,

1692
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,980
my heart hurts.

1693
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,299
After talking to Heeyoung just now,

1694
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,480
I gradually don't feel good.

1695
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,400
I want to cry.

1696
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:27,300
(Finally, Mirang shed the tears
she had been holding back.)

1697
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,050
We made a promise.

1698
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,699
But despite that, she still wanted

1699
01:05:40,713 --> 01:05:41,940
to go out with Heeyoung.

1700
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,799
But you talked that much yesterday,

1701
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
it still isn't clear?

1702
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:49,010
That's what I thought too.

1703
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,460
And she must have some reason

1704
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,966
for still wanting to

1705
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,276
go out with Heeyoung

1706
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,060
and do things like that...

1707
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,933
I really believed her

1708
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,480
after we talked yesterday.

1709
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:00,890
I trusted her.

1710
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,800
But if I were in your shoes,

1711
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,360
I'd feel betrayed and shocked too.

1712
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:11,030
And

1713
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,740
I'd lose all trust, maybe?

1714
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,720
If that were true, I would lose faith.

1715
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,760
I'm going on a date with Dagyo soon.

1716
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,300
Going on a date?

1717
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,580
I submit her name.

1718
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,830
You still haven't gone on a date?

1719
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,280
Mm.

1720
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,880
It's the first time.

1721
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,500
I've seen you cry like this.

1722
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:35,690
Yesterday's date was really good.

1723
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,020
Because it was with Dagyo...

1724
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,526
I never thought of that.

1725
01:06:39,553 --> 01:06:40,596
I'll have to talk to her.

1726
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,210
Something is going to change today.

1727
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,199
I don't care who

1728
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,400
Dagyo goes on a date with.

1729
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,990
If Dagyo went out and

1730
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:51,697
had her eyes on someone,

1731
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,777
I would sit and think to myself

1732
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:55,864
how I would feel at that time

1733
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,310
because it would be like

1734
01:06:57,335 --> 01:06:58,695
a huge betrayal.

1735
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,780
When we meet there,

1736
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,923
I'll try to calm down

1737
01:07:02,948 --> 01:07:04,628
and make things clear.

1738
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:16,600
(Dagyo is waiting for her date)

1739
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:25,300
(Who is Dagyo going on a date with?)

1740
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,570
Why do you always look so heartbroken?

1741
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:29,270
'Why am I like that?'

1742
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,559
Because that letter made me feel happy.

1743
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,420
Oh, you're exactly my type.

1744
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,690
- Why are you so attractive?
- Why? Why?

1745
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,820
I want to know you as a woman.

1746
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,169
A little worried?

1747
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,450
When I think of the conversation
we just had.

1748
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,690
That's what I want to express.

1749
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,600
(The last night at Together House,
the anxiety intensifies.)

1750
01:07:58,073 --> 01:07:59,703
I'm so uneasy I want to cry.

1751
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,600
It's the last day.

1752
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,600
Can you please not make it complicated?

1753
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,900
(Mirang sits in a daze when
she sees Dagyo crying.)

1754
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,176
She received a letter from Heeyoung.

1755
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,360
It's like she's about to cry.

1756
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,200
I will not see her in this state.

1757
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,020
I don't want to cry either.

1758
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,529
I can't control my emotions.

1759
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,916
If I can't control myself like this,

1760
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:24,130
I'll get irritated.

1761
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,900
I'll make my own choices.
