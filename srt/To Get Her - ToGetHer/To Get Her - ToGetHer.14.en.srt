1
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,480
(The morning of the 7th day
that can be seen from afar)

2
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:41,346
(The last day at Together House)

3
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:45,165
(The final selection is approaching)

4
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:50,119
(Seoyeon packing up to go back)

5
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:54,977
So much stuff.

6
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:57,639
- A lot of stuff?
- Mm.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,726
Honestly, it still didn't feel real.

8
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:02,944
It still feels like I'm still

9
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:04,416
spending time with everyone.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,380
Cooking and eating together everyday,

11
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:08,387
and sending letters at night.

12
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:09,958
There were painful moments but that's

13
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:11,493
because we've spent
so much time together.

14
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,605
I don't know.

15
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,759
I still can't believe it's over.

16
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:18,840
It's normal to have some regrets.

17
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:21,077
But I always put in my best effort

18
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,731
to sincerely express my feelings.

19
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:26,289
A lot of the things I learned here

20
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,296
will be the ones I miss the most.

21
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,730
So for today's final choice,

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,435
I think I'll follow my heart.

23
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,829
Why is my makeup flaking like this?

24
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,126
My skin feels a bit dry.

25
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:42,414
Hey Minwoo, try using that one.

26
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,076
I use that one every morning.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,813
Which one? This pad?

28
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:47,539
Every day, I use it to wipe my

29
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:49,067
face, elbows, neck.

30
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:50,655
Yes, that one, it's seriously good.

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,834
You see,

32
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,113
In the second or third day

33
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:54,882
after coming here, my skin was dry.

34
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,208
Because the air is dry.

35
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:58,545
But after using this,

36
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,742
it got super smooth. Look at my skin.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,632
Yeah, very smooth.

38
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,303
- My makeup's flaking.
- It also helps reduce allergies.

39
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:07,885
Keeps it hydrated,

40
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,105
helps makeup go on better.

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,430
- Look.
- Face must be moist.

42
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,022
- Soft and bouncy and moist too.
- You're right.

43
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:15,813
It's really good. Try it.

44
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,840
- It's really soft.
- Oh.

45
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:30,437
It's so moist and rich.

46
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,262
You can leave this sheet mask on

47
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:42,903
and then put on makeup.

48
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:44,197
Yes, I left the sheet mask on

49
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:45,603
and then went to eat.

50
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:49,258
It's soft like it has collagen.

51
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,832
Oh, that's good.

52
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:58,571
(Minwoo and Jinah are happy)

53
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,172
(Mirang and Dagyo are still gloomy)

54
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:08,761
You're dumb.

55
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,379
- What?
- I said you're so dumb.

56
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,599
You're even more dumb.

57
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:15,661
Seriously, you...

58
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:19,045
It seems you still don't understand.

59
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,271
The real reason why I cried.

60
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,971
You didn't make it clear.

61
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,008
When did I not speak clearly?

62
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:30,135
Your attitude seems unclear.

63
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,721
Last night's letter

64
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,267
wasn't just a love letter.

65
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,304
Some people don't write
for that purpose.

66
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,038
There are people who write to thank me.

67
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:40,923
I didn't cry because of love

68
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,337
or anything like that.

69
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:43,989
Is there something like that?

70
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:47,419
They said since it was the last day,

71
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,285
and they wanted to thank me.

72
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:52,127
When I read those messages, I cried.

73
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,286
Yesterday,

74
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,601
I chose you as my date.

75
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,921
I even sent you a letter.

76
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:00,952
I thought I expressed

77
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,369
everything I could.

78
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:05,187
But maybe it wasn't enough for you.

79
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,307
Still, I understand

80
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,180
what parts made you upset.

81
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:11,757
So maybe the way I cried,

82
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,603
from your point of view,

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
you didn't like it.

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,211
I understand that.

85
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:19,605
I hate that.

86
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,112
Exactly.

87
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,999
I understand.

88
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,328
- Because I feel the same way as you.
- Mm.

89
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:29,630
But what can I do?

90
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:32,917
Really?

91
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,580
Actually,

92
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:36,805
I understand that

93
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,163
you're upset

94
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:40,120
because of what I said,

95
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:41,809
but on the other hand,

96
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:45,498
it also makes me think that you know

97
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,013
how tired I am, but can't you

98
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,047
understand me a little bit?

99
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:52,022
Because it's only me until now.

100
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,310
Before, too,

101
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:56,226
I was the only one who cared about you,

102
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:57,555
so I'm tired.

103
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,027
Yesterday, there were

104
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:01,514
many things I was waiting
to talk to you about...

105
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,594
That's why when we were together,

106
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,647
I tried to explain to you
that it wasn't like that.

107
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,425
I understand that. I understand.

108
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,439
But

109
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,531
from my perspective, at that time,

110
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:15,005
I told you that I was tired too

111
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,222
and you still came

112
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,649
and cried in front of me.

113
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,936
Mmm, I understand how you feel,

114
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,573
if you had to see something like that,

115
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:25,333
you wouldn't like it.

116
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,312
People are like this.

117
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,625
Some people cry,

118
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,085
some people don't.

119
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,072
At that time, I thought

120
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,803
maybe you didn't care about me.

121
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:39,238
Yesterday... I was sulking.

122
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:40,924
I am sulking too.

123
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,628
Why are you sulking?

124
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,177
I'm the one who's more tired than you.

125
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,384
I really mean it.

126
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,653
(Sigh)

127
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,292
I told Heeyoung that I wouldn't go

128
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,350
on a date with her.

129
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:56,746
From then on,

130
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,112
I just did what I wanted.

131
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,778
I've been telling you all this time.

132
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,266
But yeah.

133
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,729
It's not like I didn't show you,

134
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:09,745
I show my feelings to you all the time.

135
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,659
Because of this, I feel hurt too.

136
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,584
Yesterday, I explained clearly to you

137
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,131
that I didn't cry because of that.

138
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,597
You just kept

139
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,441
misunderstanding.

140
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,826
So I went to tell you

141
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,019
that you misunderstood,

142
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:24,631
but you still didn't understand.

143
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,504
I understand how you feel.

144
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:28,427
That's why I can't do anything

145
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,496
except blame myself.

146
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,540
Don't do that.

147
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:41,280
(The two seem to understand each other)

148
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:46,455
(But Dagyo who is still sulking)

149
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:53,605
(Drops)

150
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,168
(The hot bag with a smiling face that was put down carelessly)

151
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:59,409
(Followed by pumpkin juice)

152
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,791
It's not that I don't like her.

153
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:05,027
But this is the last time,

154
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:06,600
so I want to take care of her

155
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,657
and make up with her.

156
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:14,739
(Mirang who wants to make up)

157
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,481
(Discovered)

158
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:29,099
(Dagyo who has many thoughts
from the reconciliation gifts)

159
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,345
- Is it yours?
- Mm.

160
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:36,672
Thank you.

161
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,215
(Glances)

162
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,150
(Feelings that are passed on without words)

163
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:54,938
(Everyone leaves their final message on the Together House board)

164
00:07:57,438 --> 00:08:02,504
(Final greetings to Together House)

165
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:14,311
(A visitor's board to leave memories of
Together House)

166
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,823
(What will you all leave behind?)

167
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:33,622
(To Together House)

168
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,345
The first thing I wrote on the board

169
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,680
was my feelings

170
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:40,877
from being here for the past seven days.

171
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:42,699
While writing it down, letter by letter,

172
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,722
my heart trembled.

173
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,173
Leaving here

174
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,411
doesn't mean that my love will end.

175
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:50,396
In the future,

176
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,861
I might meet a new love

177
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,140
that will make my heart races.

178
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:56,061
I wrote the message line by line

179
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:59,036
with a trembling heart.

180
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:01,389
(Jin-ah, 'A week full of experiences and growth to find my stable and strong love.')

181
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:05,007
(The last message that Jinah left)

182
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,127
Done.

183
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:24,327
I thought for a long time

184
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:26,066
about how to write my feelings over

185
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,274
the past seven days in
the most concise way possible

186
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,687
because these feelings

187
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:31,765
were filled with many people,

188
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:32,818
many moments,

189
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,202
and sincere feelings.

190
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,223
I thought about how to write

191
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:39,726
these things well.

192
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,085
(Seoyeon, 'The various moments and sincerity spent with many people')

193
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:47,502
Over the past seven days,

194
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:49,495
there has been love, friendship,

195
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,988
arguments,

196
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,076
and misunderstandings.

197
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,394
It's natural for these things to happen

198
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,213
when many women come together.

199
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,921
Because of these events,

200
00:09:58,284 --> 00:09:59,714
I came to realize how
meaningful they truly are.

201
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:01,384
These memories will stay
with me for a long time.

202
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:02,697
I don't know how things would've turned out if I hadn't come here.

203
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,870
Since arriving,

204
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,697
I've felt so many emotions.

205
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,613
Within such a short time,

206
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:12,799
surrounded by people I'm grateful for,

207
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:14,872
people who took care of me.

208
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:17,215
That's why I wrote it all down.

209
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,715
Day by day,

210
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,605
my heart and emotions kept changing,

211
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:25,309
even surprising me.

212
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,801
Sometimes I felt moved,

213
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,970
sometimes I felt scared,
and sometimes I felt uneasy.

214
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,076
So many feelings

215
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,674
but one thing I kept telling myself was

216
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,948
to protect my heart,

217
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,905
I must prioritize myself.

218
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,539
That mindset

219
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,778
gave me a good feeling,

220
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,117
and I hope everyone else

221
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,007
can feel that too

222
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:46,762
and feel inspired to try loving.

223
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,935
That's what I wrote about.

224
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:49,635
(This is the place that let my heart follow its true feelings. Let's be happy together!)

225
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,674
(Minwoo slowly and carefully writes each letter)

226
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:02,880
(Minwoo 'The moments of closeness with the new me and the feelings that can't be erased')

227
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:06,264
I don't think I'm able to form a relationship with anyone here.

228
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,339
It's like…

229
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:11,704
my heart just isn't ready for that yet.

230
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:12,927
Not because of the exchange of relations

231
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,645
or sharing feelings with someone.

232
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,623
But I think I'm still not able to

233
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:21,867
fully focus on all these changes.

234
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:23,675
And I wrote that down

235
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,363
with those very feelings.

236
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:28,195
(To Together house,
Jin-ah, 'A week full of experiences and growth to find my stable and strong love.')

237
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,739
(Seoyeon, 'The various moments and sincerity spent with many people')

238
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:32,733
(Dagyo 'I was so happy not just because of love,
but also because of the friendship and all the beautiful feelings I received)

239
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,236
(Mirang: 'Thank you for giving me a lot to think about. I'll miss you')

240
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,038
(Heeyoung
This is the place that let my heart follow its true feelings. Let's be happy together!)

241
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,606
(Minwoo
'The moments of closeness with the new me,
and the feelings that can't be erased')

242
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,290
(Hangyeol
'Thank you for helping me write the story of my own growth')

243
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,973
(Riwon
'Thank you for spending this whole week together.
Our relationship has already begun!!')

244
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:49,305
(Their special Together House)

245
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:53,822
Seoyeon, I never said it...

246
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,499
Thank you for choosing me

247
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,739
as your first impression.

248
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,505
You are super popular.

249
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,493
What do you mean popular?

250
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,309
What's the first thing you
want to do after returning?

251
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:08,903
Eat jajangmyeon.

252
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:11,716
And fried chicken.

253
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,696
Fried chicken?

254
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,829
I miss my dog so much.

255
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,641
You raise a dog, huh?

256
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:20,964
I'm jealous of you.

257
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:22,827
You did everything with no regrets.

258
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:26,232
I just cried a bunch.

259
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:29,414
Haa...

260
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,071
When will I ever become grow?

261
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,644
You're becoming one starting today.

262
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:42,996
(The moment of sending the last love letter)

263
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:48,085
(Please prepare to leave Together House
and go to the room of the heart)

264
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:55,011
(Jinah who walks out of Together House)

265
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,243
Even up to the end,

266
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,966
they made us write those final letters.

267
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,503
I expected it would be

268
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:05,905
the final selection.

269
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:07,877
But the feelings I had

270
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:09,761
while making my final decision…

271
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,006
were so different from

272
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,543
what I thought they would be.

273
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,603
It was surprising, honestly.

274
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,484
I really want to know
what other surprises

275
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,087
this Together House will bring me...

276
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:27,681
I felt such relief.

277
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,200
Honestly, up until now

278
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,680
I kept wondering,

279
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:32,104
"Who should I write to?"

280
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,792
and things like that.

281
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,351
But today

282
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,220
after clearing out all my emotions

283
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,632
and going to write the letter,

284
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:42,692
Today, I will think only of that person

285
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:45,799
and decide to write a letter to her.

286
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,708
On my way to write the letter,

287
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:50,073
I feel more relieved than I thought.

288
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:51,738
I'm off now.

289
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,154
Take care.

290
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,131
- Take care.
- Don't go.

291
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,135
Don't go.

292
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,240
Honestly, I thought there

293
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,218
was still a lot of time left.

294
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:07,148
But looking at each day,

295
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,208
it felt long,

296
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,426
yet short at the same time.

297
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,867
I didn't expect to go through

298
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,611
this many emotions in such a short time.

299
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,313
I thought, 'This is the last latter.
It has to be written well.'

300
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:18,067
I'm still worried about what to write

301
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,940
because I've already chosen that person.

302
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,191
Goodbye.

303
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,196
Goodbye.

304
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,524
I don't want to regret coming here.

305
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:41,188
I will tell her my feelings

306
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,539
and I will be honest

307
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,231
and sincere about my feelings.

308
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:45,867
So whether things worked out or not,

309
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:47,087
that didn't matter anymore.

310
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:48,544
I already knew clearly who I was

311
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:50,344
going to write the letter to.

312
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:52,626
I'm going.

313
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,490
I like getting to know someone slowly.

314
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,879
But because I'm not the type

315
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,830
who wants to connect with people

316
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,511
right from the first meeting,

317
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:08,901
I was really worried while being here

318
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:12,678
afraid that I might end up leaving

319
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:14,286
without ever starting anything at all.

320
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:16,031
But she kept showing me

321
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:17,622
her sincerity all along,

322
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:18,654
and I'm truly grateful for that.

323
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,252
So, I've decided to prepare myself

324
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,966
to write her a letter.

325
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,915
Honestly, I didn't want to go home.

326
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,293
The time we spent together

327
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:34,752
went by so quickly.

328
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,168
When I think back on everything,

329
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,621
it makes me feel a little down.

330
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,665
I don't even want to write

331
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,370
the words ‘last time.'

332
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:43,358
Even though we're leaving this place,

333
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:45,147
this isn't the end.

334
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,675
So I thought,

335
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,008
‘Say everything you want to say,
just let it all out.'

336
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:52,738
I thought really hard about

337
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:53,896
how to act in a way that

338
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,590
I wouldn't regret later.

339
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,631
After our conversation yesterday,

340
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,042
even though I believed

341
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,576
I no longer had feelings,

342
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,413
a small part of me still wondered,
maybe something was left,

343
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,848
or maybe I was just being

344
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:05,388
swayed by my emotions.

345
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,581
This is the moment for me to be sure.

346
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,119
I hope this will be

347
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:11,639
a time that allows me to

348
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,067
be the most honest and
straightforward with myself.

349
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:19,632
(The last love letter)

350
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:21,502
Mmm...

351
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,219
(The last love letter
that will convey feelings)

352
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:31,819
(After writing a letter to the person who wants to confess, go to that place to deliver the letter)

353
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,101
From... Again.

354
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:50,754
(A love letter filled with many thoughts)

355
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,240
The word 'like', it's something

356
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:00,593
I've been wanting to say.

357
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:02,123
I wanted to try writing it down

358
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,267
at least once.

359
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,360
And as I wrote it, my heart wavered too.

360
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,052
I don't want to have regrets,

361
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,545
whether my choice ends
in happiness or not.

362
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,142
That's why I'm going to

363
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,621
follow the voice of my heart

364
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,272
so I didn't overthink it at all.

365
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,525
If there was someone here

366
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,199
who wanted to move forward with me,

367
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:22,254
or if there was a chance to
continue building a connection,

368
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,032
it might have allowed me

369
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:25,559
to feel something truly good

370
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:29,499
so I do feel a bit sad about it.

371
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,528
Because I never really

372
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:39,051
had a serious conversation with her,

373
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:41,116
it made me wonder what I could do

374
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,750
to avoid burdening her

375
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:44,019
and maybe even help ease

376
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,513
some of her stress.

377
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:51,426
(Minwoo, who is struggling
to write a letter)

378
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:53,197
To be honest,
I was thinking about it too,

379
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,900
my hand just wouldn't move.

380
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,057
But still,

381
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,909
I wrote down the feelings I had

382
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,954
in my heart since yesterday.

383
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,545
(Another person who can't write)

384
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,753
I had already thought about
what I wanted to write,

385
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,491
but when it came time to write it,

386
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:12,863
I couldn't get anything down.

387
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,086
So I ended up

388
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:15,611
thinking a lot about

389
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:17,225
how to express

390
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,764
what's truly in my heart...

391
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,618
how to end it in the best way,

392
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:21,976
and how to write it so that it

393
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,916
wouldn't burden her too much.

394
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:26,984
When I sat down to

395
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,287
write the final letter,

396
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,520
I felt really good.

397
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:34,163
What I wrote came out

398
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,232
just as I had felt in my heart.

399
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:37,007
I truly hope that all the friends

400
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,635
who helped us stay together

401
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,814
over these past seven days

402
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,441
will each have a beautiful ending.

403
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,491
(The letter that was folded neatly for the last time)

404
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:08,086
(In the end, who will these
girls give their last letter to?)

405
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:12,426
(After writing the letter to the person who wanted to confess, go to that place to deliver the letter)

406
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:17,185
(The moment of the final choice)

407
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:21,904
(The journey to protect their precious heart)

408
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:31,478
(The path that leads to them)

409
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:46,894
(Mirang, who is holding flowers,
is waiting anxiously)

410
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,031
I hope Dagyo will come.

411
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,898
If I leave this place,

412
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,006
I know I'll really miss her.

413
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,801
I don't want to have any regrets,

414
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,894
Whether things work out or not,

415
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:06,520
I chose to follow my heart

416
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:08,188
without any hesitation.

417
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:16,548
(Mirang's heart sends to Dagyo)

418
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,632
(Will Dagyo's heart be sent to Mirang?)

419
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:42,778
(Waiting)

420
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:51,999
(The distance is getting closer)

421
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:53,268
Hey.

422
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:55,402
Oh.

423
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,816
(Dagyo who arrived at another place)

424
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:10,239
(Who will Dagyo's final choice be?)

425
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:11,913
I'm curious to see who will come

426
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:12,980
and honestly, I'm excited.

427
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,012
What if the person
I wrote to doesn't show up?

428
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,291
Or if they do, what should I say?

429
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:28,539
(Someone who is on a journey to meet Dagyo)

430
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,243
(The two who are getting closer)

431
00:21:39,294 --> 00:21:45,096
(Heeyoung who chose Dagyo for the last time)

432
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,241
This is just the beginning.

433
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:54,637
I'm not hoping for us to get

434
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:55,832
to know each other deeply

435
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,391
or to develop a relationship

436
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,456
or anything.

437
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:00,322
I simply thought that,

438
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:01,674
in this final choice,

439
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:02,968
I wanted to do what would make

440
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:04,274
Dagyo feel the most at ease.

441
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,232
(Surprised)
Oh.

442
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,485
Honestly, I was a bit surprised

443
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,355
yesterday when we talked one-on-one.

444
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,153
I told her that no matter
who she chooses,

445
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:14,853
I hope it's a choice

446
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,606
I won't regret later

447
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:18,025
because I think that person

448
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,392
will probably be me anyway.

449
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,994
So, I felt really grateful.

450
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:23,292
Hello.

451
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,152
- I waited so long.
- Ah, really.

452
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:27,835
Didn't think it was me, right?

453
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:29,913
Today's look...

454
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:32,792
Today's outfit

455
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,991
matches the gift perfectly.

456
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:37,237
You suit it, too.

457
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,195
Did you prepare it?

458
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:43,905
Ah.

459
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,840
(The last letter delivered to Dagyo)
- For me, right? - Mmm.

460
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:48,973
I want to talk to you directly.

461
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:51,584
- More than writing a letter.
- Really?

462
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:52,628
- Mmm.
- The content of the letter, right?

463
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:54,918
The letter is just a short message.

464
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:56,300
- Oh.
- Yeah.

465
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,351
- Can I see what you wrote?
- Oh.

466
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:00,567
(Sure)

467
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,606
'To Dagyo'

468
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,571
'I want to know more about what you're like.'

469
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,199
'Heeyoung'

470
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:21,292
That's what I feel.

471
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,838
I don't know who you chose but.

472
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,125
But I...

473
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:31,990
I really feel sorry.

474
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:33,434
I realized it too late.

475
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,309
If it weren't like that,

476
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:37,037
we would have had a chance to

477
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:38,304
learn more about each other.

478
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:39,744
Besides,

479
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,015
I don't regret it at all.

480
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:44,188
It's a choice that you won't regret?

481
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:47,938
It's just like I've always done.

482
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,230
Even though I realized it too late.

483
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,829
I don't regret it either.

484
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,364
Now that I think about it,

485
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:56,289
you must be

486
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,438
quite troubled.

487
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,800
I don't want to trouble you.

488
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:03,684
Thank you.

489
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,934
I'm really fine.

490
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,103
- Thank you.
- Don't cry.

491
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,892
- I just thought you
- Mmm.

492
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,218
chose without regret.

493
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:17,432
So I feel relieved.

494
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,496
Because I thought that person

495
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:23,521
would be me.

496
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,321
So I feel very grateful.

497
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,549
Because she should know

498
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,921
who I have feelings for.

499
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:32,798
But she still wrote me a letter

500
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:34,982
until the last time.

501
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,120
For me,

502
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:38,464
I just want to say thank you

503
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:39,979
for giving me the experience here.

504
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:42,190
I don't want her to feel too burdened.

505
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,333
That's the message

506
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,657
I wanted to convey.

507
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,294
How cute.

508
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,344
- Here, this is a gift.
- For me?

509
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:57,322
Your gift.

510
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:00,408
Thank you.

511
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:04,173
(The residents who revealed the gift
After revealing the gift

512
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,990
in the final selection in advance)
to be given to the future chosen one.

513
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:08,229
Also tell your reasons
for choosing that gift.

514
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:11,063
My gift...

515
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:14,357
(Curious)

516
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:16,625
A photo album.

517
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,632
(Photo album to store memories)
- Wow, a photo album. - That's great.

518
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:21,022
That's great.

519
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,639
Take a photo and keep it.

520
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,655
After this,

521
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,154
when the photos are developed,

522
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,384
they will be stored here.

523
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:30,954
The reason is that I want us to create

524
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:32,325
lots of memories together.

525
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:33,353
Isn't it that

526
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:34,827
you're asking to fill up

527
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:35,792
the album with photos?

528
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,020
If that's the case,

529
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,266
I'll have to buy more.

530
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,450
Okay, okay.

531
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:44,779
That's about it.

532
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:46,193
Done.

533
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:48,797
After this...

534
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:51,972
If I develop the photos

535
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:53,665
on the film camera that I took,

536
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:55,243
- I also took them too.
- Mm.

537
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,658
- Your digital camera.
- I'll send it over.

538
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,586
I'm going to develop those photos

539
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:00,761
and put them in an album

540
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,293
because I want to cheer you on.

541
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:03,687
- Me too.
- Oh.

542
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,553
I want you to be very happy

543
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,178
with those memories.

544
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,936
Please keep them safe.

545
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:13,886
Thank you.

546
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:15,795
Really.

547
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:19,302
(Heeyoung's sincerity in supporting Dagyo)

548
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:21,448
Giving someone a gift is

549
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,843
a reminder that

550
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:25,167
we've met that person,

551
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,406
but I

552
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:27,870
just want to support

553
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:30,309
Dagyo in everything.

554
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,724
That's why I gave her the album.

555
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:35,054
I wanted her to fill in the stories here

556
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:38,188
and create many memories.

557
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:39,805
I said that and gave it to her.

558
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:47,355
Thank you very much.

559
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,678
Don't cry.

560
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:57,527
I didn't cry at all. It's just...

561
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,111
I feel grateful.

562
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:02,209
Thank you.

563
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:14,859
I feel good that she doesn't

564
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,564
regret her last choice.

565
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,804
But still...

566
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:25,663
I want to tell her that

567
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:26,898
I will keep that feeling.

568
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:29,400
She did well and..

569
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,620
Dagyo,

570
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,329
thank you for liking me.

571
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,808
And I'm sorry

572
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:45,948
I realized it too late.

573
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,582
You look so happy now,

574
00:27:48,588 --> 00:27:49,810
and I'm happy too.

575
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,906
Because you're the ones I love,

576
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,541
I hope you'll make good memories

577
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:00,187
from this experience.

578
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:03,136
Fighting!

579
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:18,227
(A shadow seen from afar)

580
00:28:19,223 --> 00:28:23,956
(Seoyeon who chose Mirang
as her last choice)

581
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:25,701
I was so excited.

582
00:28:26,268 --> 00:28:27,629
Very excited.

583
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,177
But

584
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:30,704
it might be because I already thought

585
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:33,275
about what the outcome would be

586
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,091
because I know what Mirang is thinking.

587
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:38,319
I feel

588
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:39,799
both excited and relief.

589
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:41,413
Hey.

590
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:43,713
Oh.

591
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,923
You knew I was coming, didn't you?

592
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:53,240
I had no idea.

593
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:55,004
- You didn't know?
- Mmm.

594
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:56,029
Why?

595
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,758
Because I thought you would go to Dagyo.

596
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,706
I really didn't think Seoyeon

597
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:02,160
would choose me.

598
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,247
When I found out it was Seoyeon,

599
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:06,049
I felt grateful.

600
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:08,794
Even though I had only
ever looked at Dagyo,

601
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,596
she still gathered her courage to come.

602
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:13,000
So I felt both grateful and sorry.

603
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:16,479
Oh, yesterday's letter?

604
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,785
That letter...

605
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:20,057
I've already

606
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,533
talked to Dagyo.

607
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,495
- And...
- Oh.

608
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,036
It's like I've cleared my feelings.

609
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:34,363
(Seoyeon who carefully sends the letter)

610
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:35,391
I'll read it.

611
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:39,528
It feels better to give it this way.

612
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,415
It makes me feel relieved

613
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,155
and like I'm free.

614
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,789
'To Mirang'

615
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:54,203
'I'm sorry.'

616
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:56,103
'I wish you much happiness'

617
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,447
'From Seoyeon'

618
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:05,533
I understand.

619
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:07,291
Thank you.

620
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:10,513
It's okay, I'm used to unrequited love.

621
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,286
I actually planned not

622
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:15,799
to give you a present,

623
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:17,992
just a letter,

624
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,004
but after thinking about it,

625
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:25,807
when I prepared this gift,

626
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,420
I didn't want to give it

627
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,770
because I hoped that our love would last

628
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,980
for hundreds or thousands of years.

629
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,803
As I said,

630
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,524
I want the person who receives this gift

631
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,112
to have a love that

632
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:46,004
shines brightly like a ruby,

633
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:49,000
and I hope that their future path

634
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:52,717
will have me in it.

635
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,652
(Impressed)

636
00:30:55,765 --> 00:30:58,226
So I want you to accept this gift.

637
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,115
I'll take it.

638
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:05,279
Thank you.

639
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Don't cry.

640
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,563
The gift I prepared...

641
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:15,698
is a ruby bracelet.

642
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:20,043
(Shocked)
The ruby is my birthstone.

643
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:21,782
(Ruby is Seoyeon's birthstone.)
Wow, it has meaning.

644
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:23,451
The ruby

645
00:31:23,476 --> 00:31:25,898
means radiant love.

646
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,181
I hope that in the future

647
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,730
I will have the chance

648
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,055
to have a sparkling love with

649
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:33,106
that person who is my partner,

650
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,464
so I bought it,

651
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,612
something like this.

652
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:43,712
For keeping, not for wearing, right?

653
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,593
- No, you can wear it.
- You can unwrap it.

654
00:31:45,618 --> 00:31:47,440
- It's in a box.
- Oh, you can unwrap it?

655
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:49,231
But shouldn't that person

656
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:50,931
be the one to open it?

657
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:52,838
- Wow.
- What's this?

658
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,679
- Posing like a model.
- Good at posing, too.

659
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:57,717
- Oh, I'm embarrassed.
- It's so funny.

660
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,904
- It's so funny.
- Come take a closer look.

661
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:05,402
- So sparkly.
- So pretty.

662
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:07,647
- You're so pretty in it.
- When you wear it, you're even prettier.

663
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:08,689
- Yes, prettier.
- Yes, yes.

664
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:10,723
- Looks different than when not wearing.
- Yes.

665
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:13,563
I'm not confusing you.

666
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:14,903
I really do like you.

667
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:20,985
I hardly ever chat with you

668
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,410
when we're outside.

669
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:25,149
- When?
- I didn't really talk to you.

670
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:28,290
- About that...
- Don't... Don't say it.

671
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:32,427
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

672
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,837
Oh, right...

673
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:38,456
When we were talking about the mistake,

674
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:40,009
I was really shocked.

675
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:44,546
- You said you didn't mean it.
- Oh.

676
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,299
Making me painful.

677
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:48,197
After that,

678
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:49,872
I kept on criticizing you for hours.

679
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:52,214
Not long after that, I realized it.

680
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,385
I felt very guilty towards you.

681
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,152
If I said that now,

682
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,259
it would only make you feel burdened.

683
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:00,752
So I didn't say anything.

684
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,360
- Right.
- I think...

685
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:05,470
Using this place,

686
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:07,856
it would be better to talk

687
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,561
to you directly here.

688
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:13,956
I hope you're happy.

689
00:33:17,577 --> 00:33:18,577
Do you understand?

690
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:22,632
I'm going.

691
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,105
I can only think that if
Mirang saw me crying,

692
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,529
would she feel this way?

693
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:40,315
It hurts but is also happy

694
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:41,919
and grateful.

695
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,779
I can only hope that Mirang will not cry

696
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:48,191
in the future and will be very happy.

697
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:52,885
Seoyeon is a person who doesn't talk much.

698
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,088
Even when we play together,

699
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:56,263
she likes to be alone.

700
00:33:57,274 --> 00:33:58,274
However,

701
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,770
I think she

702
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,664
is a shy

703
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,995
and quite timid person.

704
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,803
But she still gathered her courage

705
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:09,061
to express her feelings to me until the end.

706
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:10,791
She also sent me letters all the time.

707
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,966
This made me feel grateful

708
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:13,146
to her and also sorry.

709
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,211
(A new path that is not the end)

710
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:42,959
(Mirang who is holding a flower is waiting anxiously)

711
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,995
(Will Dagyo choose Mirang in the end?)

712
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,582
I am a very cautious person.

713
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,680
So I have to think negatively first

714
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:54,372
so that I don't have
to get hurt too much.

715
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,611
So I don't think she'll come.

716
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:05,212
(Aimless waiting)

717
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:12,517
(Dakyo who is vaguely seen)

718
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:22,730
(The distance between the two people is getting shorter and shorter)

719
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:25,415
(Turns)

720
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:28,475
(Smiles)

721
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Hello.

722
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,855
Honestly, I didn't know who it would be

723
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:35,993
just the other day,

724
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,481
I went on dates with four people,

725
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,518
so I had no idea who

726
00:35:38,525 --> 00:35:39,436
might write me a letter.

727
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,882
But I hoped that

728
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,960
one of them would be Mirang.

729
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:43,985
And when I walked over

730
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:45,846
I saw Mirang standing there

731
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:47,146
waiting for me.

732
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:49,441
The way Dagyo

733
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:51,695
walks over while smiling
and smiles shyly,

734
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,059
it was really adorable.

735
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:54,744
And

736
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,451
I thought she wouldn't choose me,

737
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,164
so I was really thankful that she came.

738
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:01,047
I had thought that if Dagyo came,
I'd cry…

739
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:02,265
but when it actually happened,

740
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:04,464
I felt so happy instead.

741
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:06,697
I couldn't stop smiling.

742
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:07,994
I'm here.

743
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:09,605
You're here.

744
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,839
(Twists)

745
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:16,822
I'm here.

746
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,874
- I thought you wouldn't choose me.
- Huh?

747
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:21,414
I thought you wouldn't choose me.

748
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:23,006
- Really?
- Mmm.

749
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:24,622
I already said it this morning.

750
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:31,849
(Dagyo♥Mirang)
(The two who chose each other.)

751
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,026
Here.

752
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,526
(The love letters sent to each other)

753
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:37,658
I'll read it now.

754
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:44,170
'To Mirang, '

755
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:47,343
'Thank you for always expressing
your feelings toward me.'

756
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:49,060
'Right now, I'm thinking about'

757
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,296
'when you told me, '

758
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,568
'I'm not interested in
anyone else but you.'

759
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,978
'And I'm on my way to you now.'

760
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:58,493
'I like you, Mirang.'

761
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,276
'To Dagyo, '

762
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:05,701
'I'm sorry for being too selfish, '

763
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,755
'even though you must
have been tired yesterday.'

764
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:09,319
'When I saw your face this morning, '

765
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:10,769
'I thought you looked so beautiful.'

766
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,153
'This winter, I got to meet you'

767
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:14,043
'and when summer comes,
I know I'll miss you.'

768
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:16,110
'Thank you. I'm sorry. I like you.'

769
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,430
'Mirang'

770
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:18,983
How is it?

771
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,689
So touched.

772
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:24,010
You told me

773
00:37:24,606 --> 00:37:25,787
no matter what.

774
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:28,294
You'll only be interested in me.

775
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:30,413
You...

776
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:32,897
- Make me...
- Excited?

777
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:33,922
- Yes.
- Mmm.

778
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:36,587
You said that no matter who I date,

779
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:39,552
I'll always choose you.

780
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,366
I've been thinking about

781
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,486
that all day today.

782
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,284
After that,

783
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:46,121
when you told me not to go.

784
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:47,847
(Yes)

785
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:49,547
- Yes, I was jealous.
- But even so...

786
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:51,447
Are you satisfied that

787
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:52,993
it was just as you said?

788
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,310
Satisfied.

789
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:55,552
A 100 percent.

790
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:57,989
Thank you.

791
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,275
I like flowers a lot.

792
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:00,521
Here.

793
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,140
Please take this flower.

794
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,815
Mmm, this is your gift.

795
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:06,543
Take that one off and put this one on.

796
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:08,060
Okay, thanks.

797
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:10,122
Oww, I'm embarrassed.

798
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:13,096
I am curious about the flower.

799
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:15,683
Me too. I'm curious too.

800
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,460
(Whose is it?)

801
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,093
(Curious)

802
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:20,245
Who owns the flower?

803
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,841
Why is everyone looking at me?

804
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,589
It's yours, Mirang?

805
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,398
Let me guess.

806
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,095
- I think so.
- Yes.

807
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,876
- Hey, really?
- Really?

808
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:30,822
- How?
- We've been together for days.

809
00:38:30,847 --> 00:38:32,682
I get it now.

810
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:34,038
What?

811
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,786
Because we'll receive flowers

812
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:37,053
at a special time.

813
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:39,852
I want to give it after

814
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,174
we become lovers.

815
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:42,193
Every moment with me

816
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,348
is a special moment.

817
00:38:43,372 --> 00:38:45,374
So I prepared it.

818
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:47,293
- I'm so jealous.
- It's so romantic.

819
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:48,789
But this box...

820
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:50,255
(Next is Dagyo's gift)

821
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:51,752
I want to say that
it's very hard to choose.

822
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:56,042
(Curious)

823
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:58,579
(Interested)

824
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,249
My gift is...

825
00:39:01,326 --> 00:39:04,120
- Scarf and gloves.
- So cute.

826
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:05,310
(Soft gloves and scarf)
Looks so thoughtful.

827
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:06,717
Yes, so I bought them.

828
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:07,954
After becoming a couple,

829
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,338
I want us to

830
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:11,690
have memories of this winter.

831
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:13,419
Memories of winter.

832
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,395
It'll be cold, right?

833
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,707
I want us to have warm memories

834
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,839
and they're so soft.

835
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,774
So I ordered it.

836
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:25,515
How do I know they're soft?

837
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
Because I have one too.

838
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,012
Oh, you have one too.

839
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:31,298
I ordered it to be the same

840
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,702
as my favorite scarf.

841
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:35,359
- I'm embarrassed.
- Are the colors the same?

842
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:36,384
The colors are not the same.

843
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:39,000
It would be a shame to just buy a scarf.

844
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:40,862
- So I bought gloves too.
- A pair of items, huh?

845
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:43,937
(A gift for a warm winter)
That's about it.

846
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,017
I like flowers very much.

847
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:49,217
I'll buy you a lot.

848
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:54,558
- I'm so excited.
- Me too.

849
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:57,807
- Does it feel good?
- It feels great.

850
00:39:57,832 --> 00:39:58,832
Right?

851
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,260
- Me too.
- Let's go.

852
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,018
Thank you for coming.

853
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:15,553
I had to come.

854
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,884
Why did you think I wouldn't come?

855
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,965
You looked in a bad mood this morning.

856
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,753
You're really dumb.

857
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:28,425
- Dummy.
- I almost cried.

858
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,911
Let me ask you, are you younger than me?

859
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:33,091
Really?

860
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,839
Looks like you're younger than me.

861
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:42,221
I'm so grateful that you chose me.

862
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,998
Thank you for opening your heart to me

863
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,122
in such a short time.

864
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:50,177
I just feel that

865
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:53,092
I want to see her all the time

866
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,292
until the day that

867
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:56,719
liking turns into love.

868
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,054
Thank you very much.

869
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:03,295
It's not easy

870
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:05,394
to just look at one person

871
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,235
from beginning to end.

872
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:10,382
I want to thank you for
not listening to others

873
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:12,492
and still choosing me

874
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,005
until the last second.

875
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,210
It's just...

876
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:17,943
I want to say that I like her.

877
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:21,164
What's your name?

878
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:23,102
I'm Kim Miarang.

879
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:24,195
Huh?

880
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:26,175
Kim Mirang.

881
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:27,928
- Mirang.
- Yes, rang.

882
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,225
- Rang? Oh.
- Yes.

883
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:32,432
(The first chaotic meeting)

884
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,015
When choosing

885
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,705
(The first date of the two)
among the three cards,

886
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,962
I chose the oriental one.

887
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:41,666
Actually, I don't care about
the picture at all.

888
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:42,691
I just want...

889
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:43,852
Thank you.

890
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,357
to try dating.

891
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:48,814
- Really?
- Yes.

892
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:52,081
Or do you like Heeyoung more than me?

893
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:54,350
(Misunderstanding and Jealousy)
That's not true. We just haven't been on a date yet.

894
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,049
Because we came here to get
to know each other, after all.

895
00:41:57,074 --> 00:41:59,053
If I had the chance,

896
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:01,177
- can I go?
- Mm.

897
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,091
If I didn't like it, you wouldn't go?

898
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,556
If you didn't like it?

899
00:42:08,286 --> 00:42:09,643
Then I wouldn't go now.

900
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,822
Did you choose Heeyoung today?

901
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:16,461
Today? No.

902
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,786
(Their mixed feelings)

903
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:23,125
(Worries)

904
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,574
I chose you.

905
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,488
I chose right away.

906
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,216
(Tired moments)
- Confused? - No.

907
00:42:32,515 --> 00:42:33,515
It's not like that.

908
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,651
Just a little tired.

909
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,431
Today I

910
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:42,009
talked to many people

911
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:45,183
that made me tired.

912
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:48,042
Those feelings

913
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:51,811
they all came at once.

914
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:54,363
This feeling...

915
00:42:54,646 --> 00:42:57,038
I really like you.

916
00:42:57,192 --> 00:42:58,713
Not because of the show.

917
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:00,450
(The feelings that were passed on to each other for the last time)

918
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:01,621
I like you now, too.

919
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,207
Really?

920
00:43:06,726 --> 00:43:07,877
Me too.

921
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:19,678
(Dagyo and Mirang chose each other)

922
00:43:26,126 --> 00:43:31,318
(To Get Her)

923
00:43:33,008 --> 00:43:36,354
(Their stories that were not continued)

924
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:48,024
(A letter that was not forwarded by herself)

925
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,609
'To Minwoo'

926
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,542
'Thank you for listening to this
big sister who is like a kid'

927
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,819
'Thank you for comforting and
giving me so much advice.'

928
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,924
'Thank you for helping me be a
person who is honest in love.'

929
00:44:02,198 --> 00:44:05,084
'Helped me overcome various situations.'

930
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:08,866
'Thank you for helping me'

931
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:11,093
'understand my own heart
more than before.'

932
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,118
'Jinah'

933
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,513
Yesterday, after writing to Dagyo,

934
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,697
I also feel like writing another letter.

935
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,176
Dagyo who is with me

936
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,689
almost all the time in this house

937
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:23,993
and Minwoo who is my roommate.

938
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:25,301
Even though it was a short time,

939
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:27,043
but I want to tell them

940
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,080
the feelings in my heart

941
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:30,744
to the people who are with me

942
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:31,878
all the time.

943
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:32,921
I want to tell you guys thank you.

944
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:34,676
Because of them I am happy.

945
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:36,226
Because of them it makes

946
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,920
this memory even more beautiful.

947
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:45,566
Even though I never raised her,

948
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:47,792
but thank you

949
00:44:48,283 --> 00:44:49,283
for growing up so well.

950
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:54,390
(Who will receive the last love letter?

951
00:44:55,322 --> 00:45:00,548
(Minwoo ponders for a long time)

952
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,882
I won't choose in the end.

953
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:05,987
And I want to write a letter

954
00:45:06,012 --> 00:45:07,520
to the person I trust the most.

955
00:45:10,183 --> 00:45:16,423
(Who is the person Minwoo
wants to send the letter to?)

956
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:17,744
'To Seoyeon'

957
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:20,063
'Because I met you, '

958
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,210
'I was able to accept
my own weaknesses.'

959
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:23,905
'Thank you, my pine tree.'

960
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:27,032
- Minwoo.
- Yes?

961
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,326
If you don't mind, would you like
to come sit with me?

962
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:31,025
My feelings for Seoyeon,

963
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,467
aren't love or anything like that.

964
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:35,413
But she seems

965
00:45:35,571 --> 00:45:36,834
like a really nice person.

966
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,594
She's the only one

967
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,873
I can vent my feelings to without fear.

968
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:42,988
She's the one who gave me advice

969
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:44,976
that allowed me to find a solution.

970
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,673
I think she might be someone

971
00:45:46,837 --> 00:45:48,283
who thinks the same way as me.

972
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:50,180
Like a friend who's not that close

973
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,673
but not that distant.

974
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,191
I feel like she's a pine tree.

975
00:45:54,216 --> 00:45:56,491
That's why the final letter,

976
00:45:57,038 --> 00:45:58,502
I wrote, 'Thank you, my pine tree.'

977
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,801
The expert in unrequited love Seoyeon,

978
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,520
from now on, your love story

979
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:05,173
will definitely not be lonely.

980
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:09,512
Among the seven people
in Together House,

981
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:11,745
the one who I want to
be her love support

982
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,292
is Minwoo.

983
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:14,968
For me, Minwoo is

984
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:16,961
more charming than I thought.

985
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,727
She's funny and pretty.

986
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,890
I think she didn't have many

987
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,507
opportunities in love

988
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:25,290
while she was here.

989
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,107
I hope she'll have more opportunities

990
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:30,101
to express those feelings

991
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:32,818
more than this.

992
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:34,251
Minwoo.

993
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,330
At that time, I invited you to sit
with me because I just wanted to share.

994
00:46:37,355 --> 00:46:38,468
But if it were now,

995
00:46:38,493 --> 00:46:40,226
it might not feel the same.

996
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:44,508
Minwoo, I'm rooting for you.

997
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:45,835
Fighting!

998
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,036
Seoyeon.

999
00:46:49,364 --> 00:46:51,710
She's the person I support the most.

1000
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:53,925
She must meet the person

1001
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,088
she loves and be very happy.

1002
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,026
Let's go on a double date together.

1003
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,988
I will support you.

1004
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,723
Heeyoung.

1005
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,749
She's so charming...

1006
00:47:04,774 --> 00:47:06,721
(Just kidding)

1007
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:08,143
And she's funny too.

1008
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,958
And she's a friend who's very tearful.

1009
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:14,579
Even though she looks tough

1010
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,489
on the outside,

1011
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:17,623
but she's a gentle person.

1012
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:20,995
If you're tired, contact me.

1013
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:24,463
You'll find someone who's right for you.

1014
00:47:26,118 --> 00:47:27,837
I hope our friendship

1015
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:29,462
will stay like this.

1016
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:31,588
And I hope you find someone good.

1017
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:32,722
Fighting, fighting!

1018
00:47:33,532 --> 00:47:34,920
I feel good.

1019
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:36,333
And I'm very happy.

1020
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,357
Where else in my life will I have

1021
00:47:39,382 --> 00:47:40,423
the chance to do this?

1022
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:43,387
I dated four women in one day.

1023
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:47,292
It makes me feel very sensitive.

1024
00:47:47,813 --> 00:47:49,287
Because everyone is important to me.

1025
00:47:49,312 --> 00:47:50,353
Even after I leave,

1026
00:47:50,378 --> 00:47:51,846
I still want to see them.

1027
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:54,205
I've been eagerly looking forward

1028
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:56,332
to the love that blossomed
between Dagyo and Mirang

1029
00:47:57,266 --> 00:48:00,803
that happened here.

1030
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:02,916
As someone who watched over them

1031
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:05,173
as a viewer watching a drama,

1032
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:09,299
I'll be cheering for their love.

1033
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:11,900
And I hope that

1034
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:15,425
everyone's future love

1035
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:17,906
will grow to the next level.

1036
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:20,461
I think it's all so romantic,

1037
00:48:20,486 --> 00:48:22,339
because everyone has taken away

1038
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:24,191
something meaningful from this place.

1039
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:25,629
This will surely be a

1040
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:28,433
deeply cherished memory

1041
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,088
for the rest of our lives.

1042
00:48:30,996 --> 00:48:33,484
(Heeyoung)

1043
00:48:33,804 --> 00:48:36,710
(Seoyeon)

1044
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:39,256
(Jinah)

1045
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:43,100
(Hangyeol)

1046
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:46,699
(Dagyo)

1047
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:50,231
(Mirang)

1048
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:52,450
(Minwoo)

1049
00:48:58,806 --> 00:49:02,160
(To Get Her)
