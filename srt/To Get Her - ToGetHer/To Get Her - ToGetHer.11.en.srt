1
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,010
- We're taking this car?
- Mm, let's get in.

2
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,200
You finally get to drive a car.

3
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:54,031
It won't be a good ride.

4
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,130
What did you say?

5
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,412
Wait, what do I do now?

6
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,810
Because that was the
first time I drove this car.

7
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,899
- Oh, you drove this car already?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,832
I see.

9
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,123
I was with another girl,
but I'm with you this time.

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,336
(Speechless)

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,900
So funny.

12
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,209
There was another girl
in that seat yesterday.

13
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:20,449
Mm, now I understand
why you look so nervous.

14
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,450
(Nervous)

15
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,184
I...

16
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,718
I'm easygoing.

17
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,439
I think I am.

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,210
I get a mild scent of Seoyeon.

19
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,850
- Really?
- Yeah, probably her perfume on the seat.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,697
It might be the scent from her hair.

21
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,907
We were just talking about that.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,649
(Trying to lower the window)

23
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,304
Should we lower the windows a little?

24
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:47,774
- I knew it.
- To take in the Jeju Island's air.

25
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,157
But the weather today is gloomy.

26
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:53,213
Is that a good thing?

27
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:55,141
It's really bad.

28
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:56,826
(Mirang and Dagyo's first exciting drive)

29
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:59,242
(Mirang and Dagyo's first exciting drive)
So it's good that we drive around.

30
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,822
(What does a double date really mean?)
Yes, let's just drive around Jeju Island.

31
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,987
Honestly, I didn't look
at the view yesterday.

32
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,751
- Did you drive and talk like this too?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:08,762
Really?

34
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:11,913
I kept comforting her,
'Why are you crying?'

35
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,036
Oh, the sun's out.

36
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:18,597
I've already seen a bit of this.

37
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:21,350
Really? You went on a date yesterday?

38
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:23,513
- No, no, no.
- Really?

39
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,849
(Stuttering) (Embarrassed)
I saw it yesterday, but I went out alone

40
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,250
just to take in the view.

41
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,700
(Acting innocent)

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,890
Because it's outside

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,544
so you don't see it.

44
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,535
Probably.

45
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:38,320
Yeah, that's why I'm saying this.

46
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,110
I saw this when I first got here.

47
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,931
Back and forth... around Jeju Island.

48
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:47,212
It's not the first time
someone comes here with me.

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,691
Eh?

50
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,005
I guess I'm the second
woman who gets to sit here.

51
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:55,195
Is the first time so important?

52
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:57,450
(Embarrassed)
You're the second one.

53
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,306
The second girl in this seat.

54
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,840
Is being the first one so important?

55
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,328
I wanna get some air.
I'm gonna lower my window.

56
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,008
- So nice.
- Mm.

57
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:07,801
Let's follow the wind.

58
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,812
Mm.

59
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,025
- But this place is really beautiful.
- What?

60
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,699
(Their second date
starts at an emerald sea)

61
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,125
(Their second date starts at an
emerald sea) The color is so beautiful.

62
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,383
Very beautiful.

63
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:18,299
(What kind of memory will they make today?)

64
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,776
It's the prettiest today.

65
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:22,463
So beautiful.

66
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,420
Me?

67
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,506
(Embarrassed)

68
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:28,835
What?

69
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,419
I'm so embarrassed.

70
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,396
Wait a minute. What should I say today?

71
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:36,829
Today looks pretty good.

72
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:38,983
(Staring)

73
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,740
You're flirting with me again.

74
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,489
Don't you think?

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,943
Yeah, you look good.
You're always beautiful.

76
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,530
I already went for a drive

77
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,850
with Ms. Seoyeon.

78
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,102
To be honest, I really wanted that date

79
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,883
to be with Ms. Dagyo.

80
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,708
So I volunteered to drive her around

81
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,714
because I wanted to score a few points.

82
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,599
(Where are they heading?)

83
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,100
(The place where the
ocean and the fields meet)

84
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,290
Awesome. I want to cut through this.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
The weather is really good.

86
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,369
(Mirang and Dagyo's first trip date)

87
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,650
Yes, I had to stop by for this view.

88
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,258
It's a must-see.

89
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:31,384
- Beautiful, right?
- We came up here just to see this view.

90
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,384
Who would take more beautiful photos?

91
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,939
Let's take some.

92
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,699
- To make memories.
- No.

93
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,259
(Both enjoying the sweetest date)

94
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,100
I'm not confident in this angle.

95
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,099
- Then I'll take some from behind.
- Fine.

96
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,090
Maybe from the side. How's that?

97
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,650
- Did they turn out good?
- Mm.

98
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,260
She was the date I
wanted to go on a trip with.

99
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:57,932
And I had fun getting to visit new places.

100
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,796
I hope she has more memories
with me than with someone else.

101
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:02,783
That would be nice.

102
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:03,863
Let's go.

103
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,440
But you're wearing high heels.
That must be difficult.

104
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,443
Maybe it's better to go down this way.

105
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:11,949
Looks like going down this way
is even more difficult.

106
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,900
- It's pretty steep.
- Then let's hold hands all the way down.

107
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,571
(Mirang tends to Dagyo
who wears high heels)

108
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:20,168
- I look good because I wear high heels.
- I know.

109
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,587
(Where is their next destination?)

110
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,400
An outdoor date is fun too.

111
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:29,219
Are you playful?

112
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,100
- Playful?
- Yeah, playful.

113
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,623
I'm not very playful.

114
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,319
How do you show it
when you're like someone?

115
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,389
Facial expression?

116
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,402
I just tell them.

117
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,943
You just do that without any planning?

118
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,974
That's the secret I can't reveal.

119
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,913
Oh, the secret?

120
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:48,934
(Hehehe)

121
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:49,960
Are you aggressive?

122
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:52,299
Tricking me into trusting you.

123
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,120
You have to figure it out by yourself.

124
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,890
But you didn't flirt with me, right?

125
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:58,901
(Shocked)

126
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,461
Why do you think that?

127
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,085
Did... did you do it?

128
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:06,465
- Did you?
- Don't know.

129
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:11,450
I think I find you cute
every time you flirt with me.

130
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,179
That makes sense.

131
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:14,817
I saw a cute side.

132
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,375
But I really think

133
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,510
if the other person keeps acting cute,

134
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,633
that would be the best thing.

135
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,900
If you fall for my cute side,
then it's not the answer.

136
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,549
Have you ever dated someone cute?

137
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,550
Don't know.

138
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:35,020
You're so evasive.

139
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:40,733
So do the people you dated
have different personalities?

140
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:41,864
They do.

141
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:43,959
But all my friends agree that

142
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,339
they must have this one quality.

143
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,270
I revealed my secret yesterday.

144
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,556
My reason for keeping this a secret

145
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,546
even though someone's interested in me,

146
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:56,138
is because I have a very specific type,

147
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,090
so they may not approach me.

148
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,272
I see.

149
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,485
- That's true.
- And even if they like me,

150
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:03,389
I may not feel the same way.

151
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,453
"Dagyo said she used to date
someone like that." Something like that.

152
00:07:07,464 --> 00:07:08,394
Yes.

153
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:11,664
Saying that really reminds me of you.

154
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,785
(Disappointed)

155
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:17,003
That's why I laugh when I talk about it.

156
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,240
Because I'm keeping it a secret.

157
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:23,900
Now you're here and you're exactly my type.

158
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,221
So I don't know how to act.

159
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,046
But 'why is it a secret?'
I couldn't figure it out.

160
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:32,151
- There might be someone else.
- What did you expect?

161
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,900
I didn't. I just thought,

162
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,576
"I had to ask Dagyo about it." That's all.

163
00:07:36,587 --> 00:07:38,660
From what you're saying right now,

164
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:41,194
you just have to keep it a secret.

165
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:44,200
(Correct)

166
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,532
I'm just really curious.

167
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:47,626
What's your type?

168
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:50,330
You can't tell me, but that's
what I'm curious about the most.

169
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,838
"What kind of person will you date?"

170
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,170
Because you said once that

171
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,443
there were two people you liked.

172
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:57,109
Because I...

173
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,074
have short hair. The
other person has long hair.

174
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:02,315
I don't care about that.

175
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,910
I was like, "Huh? What?"

176
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,171
When did you start keeping it short?

177
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,900
- When I was 23.
- 23?

178
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,250
- I'd love to see that.
- When I had long hair?

179
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,389
- When I had long hair, people said I was pretty.
- I would think so.

180
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,264
(Embarrassed)

181
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,000
(While getting to know each other, they arrive
at their destination without realizing.)

182
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,432
- What's this?
- What?

183
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:28,374
(What is this place they arrived at?)

184
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,060
What do you think it is?

185
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,386
Probably a double... a double...

186
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,520
Probably the last thing we expect.

187
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,888
Will there be another pair on their date?

188
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,466
No idea. We'll find out soon.

189
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:46,499
What's this?

190
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,419
(What is this place they arrived at?)

191
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,573
What's going on?

192
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,304
(The place that feels
luxurious and comfortable)

193
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:05,400
(What kind of date they
will be having here?)

194
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:10,100
(Looking around)

195
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,900
(What did they find?)

196
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:16,754
(A special occasion is given to
Ms. Kim Mirang and Ms. Park Dagyo

197
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,134
(who chose the keyword "double"
to doubly enjoy their 1:1 date.)

198
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,893
(A special event for Mirang and Dagyo)

199
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,580
- Eh? What?
- It's too much.

200
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,591
What's the matter?

201
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,470
(Getting to have a cozy night alone)
The "double" card that you two...

202
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:36,169
(Embarrassed) (Confused)

203
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,159
All day and night... All
day and night... Mm...

204
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,276
A cozy night?

205
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:46,786
Didn't expect to come in and find this.

206
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:49,335
I didn't expect it to
convey like that at all.

207
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:50,800
That sentence...

208
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,450
Right now I'm so surprised I can't speak.

209
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,500
A cozy night?

210
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,325
Cozy.

211
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,707
Let me sit.

212
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,884
As soon as we walked in,

213
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,406
we found a note on the table.

214
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:17,125
The two of you will be
doubly satisfied on this cozy night.

215
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:19,385
The writing was that explicit.

216
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:22,306
That sentence sounds to be very seductive.

217
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:24,829
I was like, "Is it really okay?"

218
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,728
I like going out to places and having fun.

219
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:31,186
But now if I can stay in,

220
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,432
I don't have to care
what other people think.

221
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:35,980
And there are still many things I can do.

222
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,833
That's why I like going on dates at home.

223
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,289
This house is huge.

224
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,280
First of all, there's another room.

225
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,244
- Shall we check it out?
- Where is it?

226
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,211
Wow.

227
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,796
Is this the bedroom?

228
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,250
(Embarrassed)

229
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,470
It's okay.

230
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:58,846
We won't be able to sleep.

231
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,010
Of course I didn't expect to sleep there.

232
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,153
I thought no matter what we'd go back.

233
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,586
I never thought we'd have the whole day

234
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,596
together like that, so I was shocked.

235
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,700
(The room both will be
enjoying their cozy night.)

236
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:20,879
- A bathroom.
- But it's kind of strange.

237
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,303
(Both trying to find what "double" means again)
But if you think about it, why is this place...

238
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,994
There are two bathrooms here.

239
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,537
So maybe another pair is coming here.

240
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:36,780
But it says, "Just you
two will be staying here."

241
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,900
What should I do now?

242
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,563
Oh, there's a projector.

243
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,337
What else?

244
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:51,060
This looks fun.

245
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,659
(Love Test)

246
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,018
- What book is this?
- If assuming that we.

247
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,238
(Getting to know each other) If we
do this all day, we won't get any sleep.

248
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,824
(through the first couple test)
The only thing we can do. - Yes.

249
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Okay.

250
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,650
Because we're not dating yet,

251
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,720
I hope we won't find difficult questions.

252
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,092
(How much skinship do you allow?)
Skinship.

253
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,339
Wait a sec. A question like this...

254
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
(Embarrassed)

255
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,404
I'm gonna write it down.

256
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,486
Just answer based on our own standards.

257
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,700
I should do that, right?

258
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,953
My hand's shaking so much I can't write.

259
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:40,500
(A love test that seems to shake them)

260
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,100
(The most nervous moment,
equal to their first date)

261
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,386
What did you write? I
wrote down everything.

262
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:51,749
(Hahahaha)

263
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,136
- Damn it.
- What?

264
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,379
- You're brave.
- Am I being too forward?

265
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
Everything.

266
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,646
Everything I want.

267
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,274
Everything I want.

268
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:05,800
(Bang)

269
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,765
Oh, it's so funny.

270
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,928
Damn it, this is so embarrassing.

271
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,136
It's suddenly hot.

272
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,129
I felt embarrassed even though
there was nothing embarrassing.

273
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,186
The whole time.

274
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:22,244
"This is when I'm excited about you."

275
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,840
Mm...

276
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:29,739
What is there to not feel excited about?

277
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:30,986
I know.

278
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:39,800
(Both thinking of the moment
they were excited about the other person)

279
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,150
- You're done.
- Mm.

280
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,520
When you don't confuse me.

281
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,720
"Just don't confuse me."

282
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,565
She writing that made me feel very good.

283
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:54,829
I was thankful she wrote that.

284
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,328
You're very beautiful
every time I see you in the morning.

285
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:04,563
When you almost touched me,
you were clearly flirting with me.

286
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:05,664
Yes, I was.

287
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:06,853
Oh, really?

288
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,700
Oh, now what?

289
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:12,295
I was flirting.

290
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,896
How did you not know?

291
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,220
I'm a reserved woman.

292
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,899
Oh.

293
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:22,794
So what else?

294
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,732
- Let's do this one.
- What?

295
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:30,893
"How do you help relieve
your girlfriend's stress?"

296
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,500
Comfort her and tell her to meet up.

297
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:36,818
Comfort her and set up a meet.

298
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:37,865
We're similar.

299
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,750
We have to meet whenever
one of us is stressed.

300
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,682
- Yes, when stressed.
- When stressed, it's best to meet up.

301
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:46,952
Exactly. If I see my girlfriend's face,
my stress will be gone.

302
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:48,443
I get to comfort her too.

303
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,538
(Two people trying to find common ground)

304
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:53,130
Right. What if you're stressed
because of your girlfriend?

305
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,469
Like about what?

306
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,669
If I...

307
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,021
If I told you a big lie
while I'm out and having fun.

308
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,013
- I'd probably be pissed.
- Yeah. Would you go out and find me?

309
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,773
- I wouldn't.
- What would you do?

310
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,550
- Just acknowledge you were out.
- Would you sulk?

311
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:09,275
If you're out, I'd just go to sleep.

312
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,610
Just sleep. You wouldn't do anything?

313
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,270
When I wake up the next day,

314
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,680
once she's sober, I'd bring it up.

315
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,018
It's pointless to talk while she's drunk.

316
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,864
Drop the bomb when she's awake and sober.

317
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,954
But lying is what I hate the most.

318
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,492
- Lying?
- Mm.

319
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:28,727
If that happens to you, what would you do?

320
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:30,052
I'd probably go there first.

321
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,420
- Really? You'd follow her there?
- Yes.

322
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:34,566
- I'd go to the end of the earth...
- So scary.

323
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:36,850
I'd follow her as far as I could.

324
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,571
Then I'd probably get her home.

325
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:41,796
Oh, really?

326
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:45,506
After that, I'd wait for the next day
for her to be sober as well.

327
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,546
"Were you crazy yesterday?"

328
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:49,857
There are only three chances.

329
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,829
I'd casually say, "I'm not going."

330
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,133
You'd say, "I'm going there right now."

331
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:59,013
Because I'd had some questions
I'd wanted answered from the beginning,

332
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,274
so I had time to get to know Dagyo better.

333
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:08,267
But after the show,
if we get a chance to date each other,

334
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,538
it would be nice if we could add to
what we lack and exchange those things.

335
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:13,439
Okay.

336
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,575
If we get to date. If you choose me.

337
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:20,746
Whatever happens next
from now until the end of the show.

338
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:22,807
Don't think I'm a sure thing.

339
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,114
I'm not thinking that.

340
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:28,330
Are you thinking that
because I called you yesterday?

341
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,956
- I don't know.
- Where are you going?

342
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,913
- Gonna find food?
- Yes.

343
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:36,000
(Both getting closer in their
private space) But where?

344
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:40,276
Losers! Come eat!

345
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,174
- Don't call us that.
- I'm a loser too.

346
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,344
Ah...

347
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:47,295
Done.

348
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,964
Should I eat this pork belly?

349
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,506
Yeah, that's what I'm eating.

350
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,500
Shall I grill it?

351
00:16:57,328 --> 00:16:59,841
- Yeah? You're probably better at it.
- No tongs.

352
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,200
- You're a good griller.
- Use these instead.

353
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:08,227
First of all, I'm glad
everyone's comfortable with me.

354
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:12,364
Right now peace of mind is the best thing.

355
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:16,499
And yesterday Ms. Minwoo showed
how determined she was.

356
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,872
That was really cool and attractive.

357
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:23,264
Today I'm gonna try talking to her.

358
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,299
I can do that because
there are people around.

359
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,935
I want to create
the feeling of being taken care of

360
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,290
when I'm with Ms. Heeyoung.

361
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:32,073
The two of us enjoy being alone.

362
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,643
I'm someone who creates
an indirect comfortable vibe.

363
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm not someone
who would make an effort to go out.

364
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,602
So I think staying in is good.

365
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:44,997
I think the person who's
practiced the most is Seoyeon.

366
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:45,863
Yes.

367
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:48,847
But despite having some practice,
I listen to other people.

368
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:51,801
And I've been very
surprised by what others do.

369
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,433
Those people usually think very deeply,

370
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,809
so I often get it wrong.

371
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,345
I somewhat understand their actions...

372
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:01,356
(Teasing)

373
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,157
Then I resolve things I got wrong.

374
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,652
So it's a very meaningful moment.

375
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:09,244
So you're often the one who gets it wrong.

376
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:14,159
You always say that you can't adapt.

377
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,914
Why do you agree?

378
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,324
Why do you always act older?

379
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,871
Because you still look very young.

380
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,301
Yes, yes.

381
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:24,270
I almost forgot, then I remembered.

382
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:26,572
Why do you keep forgetting?

383
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,871
Because you don't care.

384
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,838
That's not true.

385
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,962
- You don't care about me.
- Not true.

386
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:33,045
(Uncomfortable)

387
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,170
(Even when we all eat together)

388
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,852
(Subtly putting the vegetables close by)

389
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,589
(Carelessly taking care of Heeyoung
but still getting her meat)

390
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,590
Thanks.

391
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:49,501
Honestly,

392
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,520
Because she has short arms. Hard to reach.

393
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:54,796
So I helped her.

394
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,300
(Embarrassed)

395
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,173
Actually, there's a reason
I wear an open-shoulder top today.

396
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:03,333
Because she has a moon tattoo
on her shoulder too.

397
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:05,277
I wanted her to see mine.

398
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:06,802
As for the moon tattoo,

399
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,286
I don't think someone like Ms. Heeyoung

400
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:11,817
would get a meaningless tattoo.

401
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,703
So I wanted to show my tattoo.

402
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,149
I wanted to create the
feeling of connection

403
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,089
through the same big picture

404
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,118
and let her absorb it organically.

405
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:26,900
(Minwoo comes for the second time
and prepares to go outside.)

406
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:33,069
Ms. Heeyoung, let's talk outside.

407
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,826
- Be right back.
- What's going on?

408
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:42,351
- I'm gonna go talk.
- You said you were gonna make kimchi stew.

409
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,473
- She'll come back and make it.
- Yeah, go.

410
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,582
It's cold outside.

411
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:52,604
I think Ms. Heeyoung's
aware that I like her.

412
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,635
I wanted to know what she thought about
the fact that I had feelings for her.

413
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:59,987
And I wanted to know
what'd exactly happened with Ms. Jinah.

414
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:05,159
I already heard it from Ms. Jinah,
so I went to Ms. Heeyoung.

415
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,672
And I wanted to hear the rough story.

416
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,619
Because there's not much time left,

417
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:15,776
so I want to open up in the last stretch.

418
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:17,440
But I feel that...

419
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,613
I don't want to be a burden.

420
00:20:20,778 --> 00:20:22,079
What are you talking about?

421
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,633
It will help me get a
really good night sleep.

422
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:29,847
Well, I have some questions.

423
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:33,126
I wanna talk about what happened back then.

424
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Of course.

425
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:39,413
"Since I'm here, I have to do this once."

426
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:40,604
That was my thinking.

427
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:45,600
I liked that she was brave enough
to invite me for a walk.

428
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:47,970
However,

429
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,920
I was hoping to see

430
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,862
the other side of Ms. Minwoo.

431
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,850
To see if I could see it now or not?

432
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,179
(Minwoo prepared a warm tea for Heeyoung)

433
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,250
Here you go.

434
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,693
Thanks.

435
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:05,607
- Huh.
- What is this?

436
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,513
(Slurping)

437
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:12,653
(Mm)

438
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,989
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

439
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:19,395
(Peeking)

440
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:20,858
(Hahahaha)

441
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:24,525
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is, but it's good.

442
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,634
It's so obvious on your face.

443
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:33,883
I'm not a good liar.

444
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,005
I just haven't had a chance to speak.

445
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,034
You're right.

446
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,653
To tell you the truth,

447
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:47,606
I don't want to ask how you feel
or anything like that.

448
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:49,249
Because I'm not the kind to pry.

449
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,930
But what I want to know right now.

450
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,580
What happened with Ms. Jinah?

451
00:21:55,591 --> 00:21:58,900
And would you mind telling me
what the most important reason was?

452
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,149
(Nodding)

453
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,531
And I'm curious if you like or dislike her.

454
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,559
Mm.

455
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,248
Ms. Jinah and I

456
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,449
talked a lot about marriage...

457
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,049
and our future seriously.

458
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,200
That's crucial to me.

459
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,245
I just wanted to know,

460
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,030
"What are you thinking?"

461
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,178
But that was our first date.

462
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,440
And I felt that our timing wasn't right.

463
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,593
I think that actions
matter more than words.

464
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,129
Others told me differently.

465
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,393
They kept not choosing me.

466
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:35,000
Different from what she said,
but they said they liked me.

467
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:38,550
I became the second choice by default.

468
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,999
It's not that I like this person that much
or anything like that.

469
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:45,567
That's why I came here.

470
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,687
I was shocked and surprised
to hear it with my own ears.

471
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,160
It was very unexpected.

472
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,307
It's just difference of opinions.

473
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,410
We don't have the same intention.

474
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,100
We're a little different personality-wise.

475
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,082
So you ended up sharing
a room with Ms. Seoyeon.

476
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:07,400
I think Ms. Seoyeon is interested in you.

477
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:08,838
Not me.

478
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:13,734
Because I don't think

479
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:17,618
you would call someone
just to give emotional support.

480
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,794
I knew my sexual orientation pretty late,
when I was a senior in high school.

481
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:23,375
But I was also a senior.

482
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:25,272
We've lived very different lives.

483
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,010
But I felt uncomfortable
and went through some difficult times.

484
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,490
But I never had that
experience with anyone.

485
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,160
I just wanted to give support

486
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,323
when she said she'd
just discovered herself.

487
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,204
That was the biggest reason.

488
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,386
Of course, at the time I
was extremely worried.

489
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:44,361
I was grateful she'd been
caring for me and talking to me.

490
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,040
I was thankful from the bottom of my heart.

491
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,910
I think it was very different
from making a phone call.

492
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,290
That's why I like you.

493
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:55,356
You're not the type to text

494
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,302
just to say thanks or apologize.

495
00:23:57,313 --> 00:23:59,128
I don't do that.

496
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,510
I think it's fortunate.

497
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,445
If you were the type to
send thank you messages,

498
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:08,250
I would have been even more confused.

499
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:11,300
I see. That's your thinking.

500
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:13,616
That's good.

501
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,126
I feel like you're helping
me figure this out.

502
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm actually not one
to understand other people's feelings.

503
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,234
So I'm not good at empathizing.

504
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:33,800
But for the people I like,
I tend to empathize with them.

505
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:37,157
I want to know and understand first

506
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:39,377
what their intention is
for saying certain things.

507
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:42,822
What they feel calling up someone.

508
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,344
And how they feel about me.

509
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,018
What they like or hate.

510
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:51,606
We probably wouldn't get to talk.

511
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:54,026
What do you want to know about me?

512
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:56,380
I always wanted to know you.

513
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,450
Thank you.

514
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
So...

515
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,100
So...

516
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,600
(Teary)

517
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:18,733
Hm?

518
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,857
Feels like there's something in my eyes.

519
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,538
- Are you okay?
- Me? Yeah.

520
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:30,446
- What's wrong?
- Me?

521
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,700
I usually don't show it.

522
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,250
If we weren't opening up like this.

523
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,500
I'll probably feel this way
on the last day of selection.

524
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,525
That my efforts have been in vain.

525
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,233
That's about it.

526
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,826
When I wasn't aware...

527
00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:58,539
Come to think of it.

528
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:02,464
- The invisible efforts...
- The view is so beautiful.

529
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,517
- To make me feel comfortable.
- Yeah.

530
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:10,176
But I really don't know

531
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:12,437
if you're the only one
who thinks like this.

532
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:18,100
I think there are a lot of people
like me in this world.

533
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,990
If you say nothing,
almost no one will know.

534
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,516
Because it's not easy
to speak out and express yourself.

535
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:27,499
- I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me.
- You really wouldn't.

536
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,167
That's why I gathered the courage to speak.

537
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:40,497
I really didn't know. I found out just now.

538
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,560
Previously, she showed her interest
in a subtle way or straightforward.

539
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,270
Did her actions at the time
"give me some assurance?"

540
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:51,031
I really got that feeling from her.

541
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:55,048
But when she expressed herself
in a serious conversation,

542
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,882
I felt really grateful.

543
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,196
And I thought, "So people like this exist."

544
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:03,013
And I felt much better
than I had felt before.

545
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,050
I think once we're closer,

546
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:09,208
opening up is just a cute way to complain.

547
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:10,833
When I talked about that,

548
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:12,720
she looked so surprised her eyes widened.

549
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:16,321
So I thought of
"the best aspect of Ms. Heeyoung."

550
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,650
Like, "She may be a softie."

551
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,900
(Heeyoung and Minwoo
are one step closer to mutual sincerity.)

552
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,850
Feels so good right now
because it's very warm.

553
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,355
You prefer summer or winter?

554
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,623
- Summer.
- Summer?

555
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,109
- I don't like winter.
- I loathe the winter.

556
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:39,680
(Relaxing during their at-home date)

557
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,812
I probably wear each one just once.

558
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:43,782
Because you hate it.

559
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:45,001
(Surprised)
Mm. Wait.

560
00:27:45,012 --> 00:27:46,965
(The bell suddenly rings)
What's that?

561
00:27:47,518 --> 00:27:50,279
(Surprised) (Surprised)
Wait. - What's that?

562
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
It comes from there.

563
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,200
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

564
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,700
(Mirang walking to the door carefully)

565
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,046
Eh? Who is it?

566
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:07,882
Who are you?

567
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:10,588
- Hello.
- Hello.

568
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,599
Hello.

569
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:14,330
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,377
Hello.

571
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,782
- Oh, hello.
- No one held the door for me.

572
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:20,451
I have lot of things.

573
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

574
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Some gifts.

575
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:27,110
(Who are their unexpected guests?)
Oh, so nice.

576
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,900
(The couple Mimi and Vivi
making their first appearance)

577
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,700
(The calm and feminist Vivi
and the cheerful and lively Mimi)

578
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:50,000
(The appearance of a couple of five years
who have many followers)

579
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,929
I was shocked.

580
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,395
I really didn't expect it

581
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,926
that someone else would show up.

582
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:59,810
I thought, "Oh, this is why"

583
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,387
"it's called a double date."

584
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,660
What were you doing?

585
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,039
(Embarrassed) (Embarrassed)

586
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,943
Wait a minute. I had no
idea you two would come.

587
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,752
I had no idea.

588
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,429
A successful surprise.

589
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,000
They're very close to me.

590
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:20,558
- They're dating each other.
- Oh. I see, I see.

591
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,394
- We've known each other for about 10 years.
- Oh, really?

592
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:26,130
- For that long?
- Almost. We go way back.

593
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,598
I can't remember how we met.

594
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:31,449
I think we met through a mutual friend.

595
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,089
Because I had a shop,
so we saw each other a lot.

596
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,926
(Mirang and Mimi are acquaintances.)

597
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:39,432
Have you known each other long?
Longer than with me?

598
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,613
When I started dating
you, you introduced us.

599
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:43,192
I didn't know her initially.

600
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:46,013
But I went to the shop
and greeted each other.

601
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,854
- I just found out about this.
- But I didn't think you'd come.

602
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,122
- I had no idea.
- I don't think you'd come here.

603
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,958
I thought it'd be just us today.

604
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:56,609
- Oh, we're imposing.
- No, no.

605
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,100
- You're like, "Why are they here?"
- Not true.

606
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,808
Not at all. I'm very glad.

607
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,092
First of all, we have something for you.

608
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,853
- You read.
- What's this?

609
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:12,800
We've gotten a lot of surprises today.

610
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:19,770
"Today's date is a double date."

611
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,900
"You will enjoy this double date
with the couple Mimi and Vivi."

612
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,653
- I told you.
- That's why you brought a lot of stuff.

613
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:29,940
"Why is this house huge?"

614
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,922
- They have better reactions than I thought.
- So nice.

615
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:34,822
(Happy)

616
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,299
So let's see what we can cook.

617
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,893
- Let's see and cook together.
- I want to know.

618
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,550
You said you were a good cook.

619
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:44,475
- Oh, I'm not at all.
- You can trust Mirang.

620
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,546
Put on an apron first.

621
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,372
Do we have to wear one too?

622
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,283
- No, no.
- Yes.

623
00:30:52,294 --> 00:30:54,079
We have to cook together.

624
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,340
(Let's go)

625
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,770
Looks like everyone has to wear one.

626
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,579
- Turn around. I'll tie it for you.
- Okay.

627
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,113
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

628
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:05,726
Perfect.

629
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,073
(Putting on aprons for each other)

630
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,291
I'm fine.

631
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:15,773
Please tie it for me.

632
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,287
And do it like this.

633
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,100
(A double date with two couples
who are expecting sweetness)

634
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,616
This is what we brought.

635
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:25,655
First of all,

636
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:27,007
(Curious)
what's all this?

637
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,840
I'll unload everything first.

638
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,800
Please help unload it on the side.

639
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,810
Don't just watch.

640
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:33,900
It was out of reach.

641
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,389
Don't scare her.

642
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,240
Get it out gently.

643
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,793
There are steaks and pasta in tomato sauce.

644
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,730
- And canapés.
- Canapés.

645
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,160
- So you make something simple like canapés.
- You got it.

646
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,507
Please tell me how to make it.

647
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,273
Cooking does sound fun.

648
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:53,500
- Yeah.
- Right?

649
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,938
Yes, I was thinking of making dinner today.

650
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,780
I planned to eat dinner here.

651
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,430
Oh, you're right.

652
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,699
So do the two of you cook at home a lot?

653
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:06,612
We almost always cook at home.

654
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,403
I do most of the cooking.

655
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,819
She barely cooks.

656
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:15,867
Not that I can't. I'm just not good at it.

657
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,793
(Ah-ha)

658
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,538
I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen.

659
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:22,489
But I think that's important.

660
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,925
So I have to do that.

661
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,318
Are you moving in with me?

662
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:27,328
No, no.

663
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,053
I got you. Are you moving in with me?

664
00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:32,506
Figure of speech.

665
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:37,189
Now add mayonnaise.

666
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,656
And add cream cheese.

667
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,570
Then plate them in a heart shape.

668
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,440
Okay?

669
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,233
(Mimi kindly shows them)
Do it together.

670
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:45,063
(how to make canapés)
Okay.

671
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,570
How many should we make?

672
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,490
- Let's make a lot.
- A lot?

673
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:50,643
A lot.

674
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:54,511
- How many?
- We'll probably eat a lot today.

675
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:55,907
You usually eat a lot.

676
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,198
What do you mean?

677
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,759
This looks very strange.

678
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:02,800
(All over the dish)

679
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:04,080
You're probably hungry.

680
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:07,345
- Mirang said to make a lot.
- What do you mean?

681
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,955
- "Let's make a lot"?
- Mirang said

682
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:12,054
- to make "a lot."
- What do you mean?

683
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:13,091
(Acting oblivious)

684
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,370
It's because you eat a lot.

685
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:18,479
Can I eat this?

686
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,139
She just sneaked one.

687
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,029
Butter. Is this butter?

688
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,993
Oh, this is a margarine, not butter.

689
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,041
Not bad at all with the onions.

690
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,860
Put the onions on it?

691
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,720
- Just one.
- Yeah, you eat it.

692
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,179
I made it for you.

693
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,463
No, I'll pass.

694
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,419
- Don't you trust me?
- It's not that. I can eat onions.

695
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,644
Try the one with onions.

696
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:49,995
It's really good. Try just one bite.

697
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,036
Good, right? Not bad at all.

698
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,500
(Indifferent)

699
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:05,067
Failed.

700
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,469
- I failed, right?
- Usually,

701
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,600
I don't like raw onions.

702
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,720
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

703
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,385
You should have told me.

704
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:15,928
I ate it because you made it.

705
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:18,006
Eat this then.

706
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,465
Honestly, I hated that piece of onion.

707
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,260
If it were someone else,
I would have said no.

708
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,723
But what did you say you didn't eat?

709
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,466
Caught red-handed.

710
00:34:28,477 --> 00:34:29,723
We should keep it a secret.

711
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,343
- You're slacking off and sneaking food?
- We just tried some.

712
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:33,746
Please us cook first.

713
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,289
Because you asked me to eat with you.

714
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,326
Spit it out. Try again.

715
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:40,285
We're almost done.

716
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:44,370
The canapés look so good. Great job.

717
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:47,846
This is almost like a housewarming party.

718
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,900
(Looks very yummy)

719
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,763
Not finished yet, right?

720
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,672
We have to add chicken
stock. Won't take long.

721
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,096
- What's that?
- Season it with chicken stock.

722
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,587
Add chicken stock.

723
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,304
What's that?

724
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,848
(Looks like she does a lot.)

725
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,741
(Mimi's a skilled cook.)
We usually add it.

726
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,339
Try it.

727
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:19,350
(Vivi's in charge of tasting.)

728
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,141
It's a little too bland.

729
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,499
Try it and let me
know. I'll make this dish.

730
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,970
A little bland? Then
add more chicken stock.

731
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:31,986
(Both have clear duties.
(They really are a couple of five years.)

732
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,190
Try this.

733
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,830
Thanks.

734
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:40,863
Let's cut it and put it in.

735
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,878
(Two couples who cook and feed each other)

736
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,450
Dagyo said she wasn't a good cook.

737
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,608
And I'm not good at cooking western food.

738
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,144
But Mimi and Vivi came
and showed us how to cook.

739
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,370
I wanted to see Dagyo's food once.

740
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,293
I'm glad I got to see it this time.

741
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:03,821
It's really good.

742
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:06,564
It was funny that she ate so much.

743
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:08,813
Even while cooking,

744
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,902
she kept putting something in her mouth.

745
00:36:10,913 --> 00:36:13,853
Even though her doing that
was funny, it was cute too.

746
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:17,430
Because she took really good care of me.

747
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,809
It was very memorable.

748
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,800
(Because they cook together,
the food is doubly delicious.)

749
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,526
- Looks delicious. I'm so hungry.
- Great job, everyone.

750
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:35,393
(The double date's home-cooked dinner)

751
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:37,943
Should we light the
candle on the cake and eat?

752
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:40,560
Wow, what is this?

753
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:44,450
We prepared this to
celebrate the double date.

754
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,386
And this is our 2,000-day anniversary.

755
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,488
Today is our 2,000-day anniversary.

756
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,429
- Today?
- It's today.

757
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,020
Today is a really good day.

758
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,226
(Surprised)

759
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,999
So let's celebrate together.

760
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,885
(The double-date commemorating cake)

761
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:03,209
Now let's all make a wish.

762
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,600
Yay, congrats. So let's start.

763
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:10,928
- Should we sing?
- Happy the 2,000-day anniversary.

764
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,139
Thank you.

765
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,450
I wished to be able to face Mirang
even if we break up.

766
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,800
That was my thinking.

767
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,100
I wished to get another date with Dagyo.

768
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:24,911
May this wish come true.

769
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:32,400
(The girls making wishes
while pressing hands together)

770
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,130
One, two, three.

771
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,700
- Yay!
- Congratulations!

772
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,650
Let's eat.

773
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:42,942
Let's clink glasses first.

774
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:44,983
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

775
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,343
One shot.

776
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,810
One shot.

777
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,760
Oh, the wine tastes good.

778
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,300
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

779
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:56,900
Eat this.

780
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,700
(Giving food to each other)

781
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:03,868
- So much food.
- This one is good.

782
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,149
Would be even better with wasabi.

783
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:17,360
So much food.

784
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,360
Very delicious.

785
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,149
But how did you two end up here together?

786
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,092
Yesterday...

787
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:32,966
I got a phone call privilege.

788
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,467
- Oh, to call the person you wanted to talk to?
- Yes.

789
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:39,948
So only those who called
each other came here.

790
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,017
Yes.

791
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,256
Because there were "single" and "double."

792
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,445
"Double" probably had an edge,

793
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:48,826
so I picked "double."

794
00:38:48,837 --> 00:38:52,465
Is Ms. Mirang your type, Ms. Dagyo?

795
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:53,635
What do you think?

796
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:56,127
I'm curious too.

797
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,045
My type?

798
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:00,410
Her ears just pricked up.

799
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,641
- She's probably curious.
- When curious, her ears will prick like now.

800
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,178
She is.

801
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:11,502
Her overall image matches my type.

802
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,315
So she's your type.

803
00:39:13,606 --> 00:39:17,788
You're talking about appearance,
or personality too?

804
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:20,879
Her appearance matches my type exactly.

805
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,245
As for her thoughts, I want
her to show them more.

806
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,747
Something like that.

807
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,568
Did you want her to be make clearer
gestures since the first time you met?

808
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,088
I didn't initially care about Vivi.

809
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,171
But did Mirang showed
some signs of interest?

810
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,434
Honestly, since we got there,

811
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,512
this is the first time this has happened.

812
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,404
But she could be a womanizer
or just a nice person.

813
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,201
(Agreed)

814
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,346
Women can't separate these two types.

815
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:49,449
You don't know if she's nice to everyone

816
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,100
or just to you because you guys just met.

817
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,588
So I feel maybe it's all in my head.

818
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,678
So when we had our first date,

819
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,409
- I asked her everything that day.
- What did she say?

820
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,467
- I just asked...
- "You're interested?"

821
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:05,268
Were those gestures flirting?

822
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,856
- She said, "Yes."
- Wow, that's a very brave question.

823
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,660
If she said no...

824
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,580
- No.
- It'd probably end that day.

825
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,133
You must like her at first sight.

826
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:22,675
Honestly, there are very few people
I like at first sight.

827
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,579
But her appearance really got me.

828
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,671
She was the one on my
mind all night that night.

829
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

830
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,900
The wine is very good.

831
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,523
You guys are living together, right?

832
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,877
We live together.

833
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,309
And we've now been
dating for about five years.

834
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
But we've never separated even one day.

835
00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:52,000
Every day since the day we started dating.

836
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,780
- Hasn't been a day we're not together.
- It's true.

837
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,489
It's true. She's always been with me.

838
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,940
I've been by her side.

839
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,799
No matter where I
go, I'll take her with me.

840
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,700
- We're attached at the hip, right?
- Mm.

841
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,855
- How is that possible?
- When you're on a date,

842
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,700
is there something that
you don't want to do?

843
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:12,937
Like your expectations.

844
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:16,370
- I want to do everything.
- Still want to do it all.

845
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,700
Everything is perfect.

846
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,582
Do you guys think about that stuff?

847
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:22,055
Like getting married.

848
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,670
Or do want to wear a wedding dress?

849
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,317
I want to have a wedding
and wear a wedding dress.

850
00:41:26,328 --> 00:41:29,018
And do you want to invite everyone?
Or just a small wedding?

851
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,143
- Everyone, but won't be that many.
- And all the reporters?

852
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:33,354
Reporters?

853
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,719
- I'm tired just thinking about that.
- Won't work.

854
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,500
Because the reporters will be there.

855
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:42,357
If I can, I will have a wedding.

856
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:45,336
I want to get married.

857
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,616
You would have to invite your parents.

858
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,450
Parents? Of course
we have to invite our parents.

859
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,480
Because older close friends

860
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,450
around me are getting married.

861
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:03,289
They say they won't invite their parents.

862
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,141
They will invite only their friends.

863
00:42:05,152 --> 00:42:06,746
There are many cases like that.

864
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,439
Their parents probably won't come.

865
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,400
But it would be great to let them know.

866
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:13,300
- And will they come?
- If they're told, they'll definitely come.

867
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:14,912
I don't know. They may not come.

868
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,224
- But you think about marriage.
- Yes.

869
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:21,238
I have so many friends who say
they don't think about marriage.

870
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,699
What's the point of getting married?

871
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,226
Because it's not legal yet
and it's not legally binding.

872
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,100
But this is totally different.

873
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,096
Opposite-sex couples

874
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:33,993
have clear goals in marriage
and having children.

875
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,044
And there's a link between them
through a legally binding document.

876
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,238
It lasts a lifetime. But
we don't have that right.

877
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,566
- That's the biggest problem.
- Yes.

878
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,324
But the way I see it,

879
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,700
this is not ideal,

880
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:48,565
but we must keep trying.

881
00:42:48,676 --> 00:42:51,368
Because without this thing,
it's harder to live as a couple.

882
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:53,982
I'm trying to take care of myself too.

883
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,572
You're doing that?

884
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,245
(Hahaha)

885
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,713
Is it lacking?

886
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:00,653
You're right.

887
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,797
We come to Jeju Island

888
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,522
about half a year ago.
Or was it one year ago?

889
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,000
And we took wedding photos.

890
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,990
(Wedding photos?)
This is our third time on Jeju Island.

891
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:18,128
We took pictures wearing
evening gowns by the sea.

892
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:21,600
I think it's the place where
brides and grooms go to take pictures.

893
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:23,267
We were the only lesbian couple.

894
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:26,589
Everyone there was staring at us.

895
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,162
You both were wearing the gowns?

896
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,970
We both were.

897
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,067
We had to walk down that street
for more than five minutes.

898
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,461
I was really embarrassed.

899
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:37,481
There were a lot of lights.

900
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,530
And we brought a lot of props.

901
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,649
Even a bed.

902
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,210
It was perfect.

903
00:43:42,563 --> 00:43:43,572
Shockingly perfect.

904
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,551
While we were shooting,
cameras were following us.

905
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,193
And another camera.

906
00:43:49,522 --> 00:43:52,770
I asked, "Why are the
cameras following us?"

907
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,969
Despite many couples there,

908
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,809
we were the only lesbian couple.

909
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,003
And people kept looking at us.

910
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:00,442
We couldn't flee either.

911
00:44:00,453 --> 00:44:03,596
(Both still being watched) And some
wanted to take pictures close to us.

912
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:04,955
I actually liked it

913
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:07,399
but her face was so red
like it was gonna exploded.

914
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,110
In other countries,
they don't care about that at all.

915
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,130
Mm, exactly.

916
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:13,855
Then we were walking together,

917
00:44:13,866 --> 00:44:15,108
holding hands,

918
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,200
and we sang together.

919
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:20,126
(Singing while shooting to relax)
Trying to act natural.

920
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,067
T's here, so it's not allowed here.

921
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,810
- Did I sing?
- I sang something like, "Tan-tan-tan."

922
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:29,989
At the time it felt
a bit like a responsibility.

923
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,940
People were looking
but pretending not to see anything.

924
00:44:32,951 --> 00:44:36,140
At the time we pretended
there were just the two of us.

925
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,598
That moment is very meaningful to us.

926
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,647
A lot of memories.

927
00:44:39,658 --> 00:44:42,290
That's why Jeju Island

928
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,077
is a very meaningful place for us.

929
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,700
If everything goes well,

930
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:50,670
this place will become very meaningful.

931
00:44:51,312 --> 00:44:52,443
Like with us.

932
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:54,591
I really want that moment.

933
00:44:54,602 --> 00:44:57,890
The moment to hear
that kind of story from someone.

934
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,397
So I could get answers
about things I'm curious about.

935
00:45:00,408 --> 00:45:03,940
It's great to learn about these things
while getting to know someone.

936
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,530
They told us how they dated

937
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,106
and how they overcame various issues.

938
00:45:09,117 --> 00:45:11,440
And they helped us cook dinner

939
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,517
and prepare a place like that.

940
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,640
I'm 100% satisfied with the double date.

941
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,390
Shall we cook?

942
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,600
What are you doing?

943
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:28,959
- Cooking.
- Where's Dagyo?

944
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,781
- She's on a date.
- They're not back yet?

945
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,040
Let's cook together.

946
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:36,526
Today's menu:

947
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,020
pork kimchi stew,
grilled fish and rolled omelet.

948
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,473
Today I was assigned to cook with Dagyo,

949
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:50,684
so I didn't feel too good about the date.

950
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,286
But I probably expected too much.

951
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:55,799
Because it would be the first time I got to

952
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,522
do something one-on-one
with someone I liked.

953
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,810
That's why I...

954
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,110
feel strange in the way I can't explain.

955
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:07,965
(Hangyeol just returned from the date.)

956
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:10,213
- Oh, you're back.
- Hello.

957
00:46:10,224 --> 00:46:11,268
How was it?

958
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,685
Hello.

959
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:18,413
- Your hair's still pretty.
- Hello, all the princesses.

960
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:21,590
- It's very cold.
- Is it very cold outside?

961
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,250
- Yes.
- You must be tired.

962
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,293
How was the date today?

963
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,451
Okay?

964
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:32,076
No complaints. It was fun.

965
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,940
That's good.

966
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,929
We come back from our date

967
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,482
and other people in the
house ruined my mood.

968
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,900
I wanted her to come to my place,

969
00:46:44,926 --> 00:46:47,200
but I was terrified

970
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,900
of running into Ms. Riwon

971
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,525
because I went on a date
with someone both of us chose.

972
00:46:55,555 --> 00:46:57,913
"Why did I have to be so careful?"

973
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,170
Honestly, I'm scared.

974
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,600
It was practically the first time
we went out to talk.

975
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:07,300
So I wanted to talk more
on a walk after dinner.

976
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,780
- Wow.
- What?

977
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Awesome.

978
00:47:21,712 --> 00:47:24,965
"The two of you who chose
the keyword 'double' today..."

979
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,251
(your date will be twice longer.)

980
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:28,711
(You will have a cozy overnight stay.)
Twice longer.

981
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:31,481
(The rest will have dinner at
the guest house.) Oh, wonderful.

982
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:34,679
"Double" must be good then.

983
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:36,464
Double is always good.

984
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:38,169
Wow.

985
00:47:41,183 --> 00:47:42,833
The rice is all mushy.

986
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:47,157
I'm low-spirited again.

987
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,949
Although both of us are already roommates,

988
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,073
but there's a phrase "overnight stay."

989
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,366
They're on a trip for
two days and one night

990
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:57,142
in an unfamiliar setting.

991
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:02,970
I really don't want to imagine it.

992
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:06,246
Yes, I really don't want to imagine it.

993
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,412
(The two of you who chose the keyword "double"
today, your date will be twice longer.)

994
00:48:10,453 --> 00:48:13,066
(You will have a cozy overnight stay.)
Oh, now I'm mad.

995
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,499
(The rest will have dinner at
the guest house.) What is this?

996
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,900
(Shocked)

997
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,596
Wow, damn it.

998
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:21,150
I'm speechless.

999
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:22,242
We're alone here too.

1000
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:25,854
- This is basically a matrimonial home.
- We... Sorry. We have to stay here alone.

1001
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:27,904
- Eh?
- We have to stay here alone.

1002
00:48:27,915 --> 00:48:30,395
They probably go out to eat

1003
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:32,250
and have a well-rested night.

1004
00:48:33,706 --> 00:48:37,632
- Eh? So they're sleeping somewhere else?
- Yeah.

1005
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,899
- Look.
- Wait.

1006
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,910
"You will stay at another place alone"

1007
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,045
"and spend cozy time together."

1008
00:48:44,226 --> 00:48:46,006
"The rest of you..."

1009
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,000
So we'll have dinner over there

1010
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,939
- and eat together.
- We'll...

1011
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,499
We'll do that and we'll sleep here
on our own tonight.

1012
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,600
- I see.
- So we'll be alone here.

1013
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:58,869
Unbelievable.

1014
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,946
- Oi, how could they?
- I'm so mad.

1015
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,206
Honestly, I thought we'd be going out.

1016
00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:09,159
An overnight stay is crazy.

1017
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,900
- Hi.
- You're back.

1018
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,633
- What's for dinner?
- You're back?

1019
00:49:17,644 --> 00:49:18,644
Yeah.

1020
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:20,553
Kimchi stew.

1021
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,593
- You're back.
- I'm back.

1022
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:28,219
Wow.

1023
00:49:29,454 --> 00:49:30,734
Such a big pot.

1024
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:33,164
(Pork collar kimchi stew)
It's pork kimchi stew.

1025
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,903
(and grilled hairtail)
Smells great. - I did my best.

1026
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,983
(Butter omelet and a
dessert made by Seoyeon)

1027
00:49:40,182 --> 00:49:41,702
Let's eat.

1028
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,688
Bon appétit.

1029
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,315
(Minwoo gives Heeyoung the fish first.)
Eat this.

1030
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:47,936
You gave that piece to Heeyoung?

1031
00:49:47,983 --> 00:49:48,983
Why?

1032
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:51,343
I can't see it.

1033
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,175
Because she can't reach it.

1034
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,820
Thank you.

1035
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:56,910
I can't see it.

1036
00:49:58,466 --> 00:50:00,769
(Riwon gives Hangyeol the deboned fish.)

1037
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:02,882
Oh, I already got mine.

1038
00:50:03,236 --> 00:50:05,358
- Here.
- Then give me a little.

1039
00:50:05,475 --> 00:50:07,107
These are clean chopsticks.

1040
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,100
Thank you.

1041
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,929
My God.

1042
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,684
The kimchi stew is so good.

1043
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,454
Delicious.

1044
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,440
Very good. Great job.

1045
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,900
- Is it good?
- Mm.

1046
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,554
Mirang and Dagyo are staying
somewhere else tonight?

1047
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:36,796
I guess so.

1048
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,909
While we were eating,

1049
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,130
I thought a lot about Mirang and Dagyo

1050
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,804
and I was in so much pain.

1051
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,900
What did "single" do on the date?

1052
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,013
Single.

1053
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:52,450
We went to a cafe. An LP cafe.

1054
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,078
- LP cafe?
- LP cafe.

1055
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:58,864
Do you want more hairtail?

1056
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,706
Have a bit more.

1057
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,185
I must look like a pig.

1058
00:51:04,499 --> 00:51:06,099
You don't. You're growing.

1059
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,523
You're growing.

1060
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,744
Because you're growing emotionally.

1061
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:13,757
You need energy.

1062
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:15,569
There are some growing pains.

1063
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:17,709
You need energy.

1064
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:22,477
Ms. Riwon takes care of
Ms. Hangyeol like a baby bird.

1065
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:26,383
She kept giving her food
and deboned fish for her

1066
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:28,274
while taking care of other things.

1067
00:51:28,396 --> 00:51:31,580
I was so unsatisfied with myself.

1068
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:34,291
For not being brave
enough to show my feelings.

1069
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,246
I'm someone who's very
confident, clear, brave and honest

1070
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,794
in terms of what I'm interested in,

1071
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:45,465
what I feel good about,

1072
00:51:46,726 --> 00:51:48,681
what I like and love.

1073
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:53,549
But I'm getting smaller and smaller here.

1074
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,893
It's been...

1075
00:51:56,987 --> 00:51:59,680
a very difficult time for me.

1076
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:04,499
(It's a painful dinner due to
their feelings for each other.)

1077
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:08,328
What should I do if I really can't do it?

1078
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:10,100
I will ask people around me

1079
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,420
and definitely introduce myself.

1080
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,530
Really.

1081
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,900
Really.

1082
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:17,779
Do you like foreigners?

1083
00:52:18,846 --> 00:52:20,672
There are many good-looking ones.

1084
00:52:21,623 --> 00:52:23,003
Well, do you like Koreans?

1085
00:52:23,596 --> 00:52:25,683
For my first time, I'd like a Korean.

1086
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:28,289
- So cute.
- So Asians in general.

1087
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,625
My first... My first time...

1088
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,257
Oh, it's so crazy.

1089
00:52:34,463 --> 00:52:37,863
- But it's true.
- Really unexpected.

1090
00:52:37,874 --> 00:52:40,412
This is really unexpected.

1091
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,320
Aww, don't cry.

1092
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,737
- So cute.
- How should I comfort you?

1093
00:52:47,068 --> 00:52:48,272
What should I do?

1094
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:57,914
(Time to comfort Seoyeon)
