1
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,013
Who's trying to control me?

2
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:39,334
Should it be expressed?

3
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,428
It's like someone's trying

4
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:41,511
to keep me in check.

5
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:43,001
What did it say?

6
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,020
What did it say?

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,484
‘No way, right?’ Like that.

8
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:50,412
It says ‘No way, right.’

9
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:52,362
What do you mean, “no”?

10
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:56,630
(Dagyo came in after reading the letter)
I can't read the letter.

11
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,843
Isn't this controlling?

12
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,098
It's freezing.

13
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:04,320
(Mirang gives her own shirt to Dagyo who looks cold)
I'll use it to cover myself.

14
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:10,602
What to do if it's right?

15
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:19,670
I'm holding a pot.

16
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:21,221
I'll help you look after it.

17
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,280
Oh.

18
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:26,891
Why?

19
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:29,122
Today is the day of changing roommates.

20
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,024
Seoyeon who got a four-leaf clover.

21
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,062
You'll get the right to choose

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,964
your roommate and date.

23
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,919
I'm not pretending not to be picky.

24
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,951
When did you pick the four-leaf clover?

25
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:38,472
Wait a moment.

26
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:40,071
How sneaky.

27
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:41,726
Come quickly.

28
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,150
I'll have to flatter her a bit.

29
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,464
Sister.

30
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,752
(Immediately arrogant)
Hey.

31
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:49,611
Please take these enzymes.

32
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,056
- Eat them for your health.
- Sister.

33
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:54,657
No, what are you doing?

34
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,003
When did you get the four-leaf clover?

35
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:58,449
You should've told me faster.

36
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:01,383
I didn’t even know.

37
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:02,892
(Random box of good luck,
please choose one capsule)

38
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:08,766
(Random capsule given to everyone
before writing the letter last night.)

39
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:20,069
(They chose without knowing what
kind of fate awaited them.)

40
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:29,810
Huh?

41
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:32,676
Huh?

42
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:34,757
How many of them are there?

43
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:36,481
Three.

44
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:38,202
I have three too.

45
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:41,205
Three it is.

46
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:43,725
- Yay, queen!
- That’s the king!

47
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:48,735
(Seoyeon received a four-leaf clover that gives her the right to change roommates and date.)

48
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,826
But why didn’t you say anything?

49
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:52,090
Seriously?

50
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,433
I was so surprised. Someone got it?

51
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,698
Of course they did.

52
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:00,007
(Kind)
Really? The four-leaf clover?

53
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:03,292
- Hey. Don’t fake it. Come.
- You even have a date right?

54
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:05,686
Geez, of course.

55
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,928
In just 20 minutes?

56
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,184
You don’t just get picked

57
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,871
for the clover. It’s not that easy.

58
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,771
Look at what you're saying.

59
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,430
- The right to change roommates?
- That's funny.

60
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,251
Then you can change all the roommates.

61
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,603
The whole room and the whole house.

62
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,941
The house too. Even the house?

63
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,946
Yeah, you can do all of that.

64
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:28,984
You can change everything.

65
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:31,145
- 18 minutes left.
- Then when the 20 minutes are up,

66
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,958
- disqualified, disqualified.
- This isn't the time to talk, is it?

67
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,289
- Disqualified?
- Make you unable to leave.

68
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,789
- No, no.
- Hold on.

69
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,416
You can't leave, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,894
(What will Seoyeon choose in the end?)
No change.

71
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:43,407
Let's go.

72
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:44,580
I like it.

73
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,127
Isn't it enough that it's not that room?

74
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,001
Isn't it enough that we're not together?

75
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,128
That's what I think.

76
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,222
And I hope the situation

77
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,630
will be resolved

78
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:56,724
once we become roommates again somehow.

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,556
Ahem.

80
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:03,746
I'm in the center today.

81
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:06,535
Today’s queen.

82
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:11,267
(Nervous)

83
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,316
The center.

84
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:15,191
This is too much pressure.

85
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,293
Should I sit here?

86
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,322
Suddenly getting attention

87
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:19,621
like this, I...

88
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,140
Gotta move around a bit.

89
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,270
Today is...

90
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,819
yesterday’s pick.

91
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,952
She's the one who got that privilege.

92
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:30,058
So now you have to look carefully.

93
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,219
(Acting cute)

94
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,475
(Smiles)

95
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:39,247
Forcing out the cuteness

96
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:40,358
that doesn't exist.

97
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:41,417
A really rare picture.

98
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,736
Because I don't want to move house.

99
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:47,061
I don't want to close the suitcase,

100
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:49,111
so I don't take anything out.

101
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,967
I only take out the

102
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,452
necessary things at that time.

103
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:54,921
But switching rooms

104
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:58,986
and thinking of repacking again

105
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,655
is giving me a meltdown.

106
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:02,891
No, I'm already not in my right mind.

107
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,300
I can't even pack my bags when

108
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:05,722
I think about doing this.

109
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:08,641
That’s why I went to Seoyeon first and

110
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,995
begged her to keep our room the same.

111
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:13,849
Let’s first split into

112
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:16,110
building one and two?

113
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:17,433
Yes,

114
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:20,381
I’ll go first.

115
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,268
I'm having so much fun.

116
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:25,268
Because I really hate moving.

117
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:27,592
- Going to choose the first floor, huh?
- Yes, that's right.

118
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:30,056
- I'll stick to the original plan.
- Building 2, first floor.

119
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,963
Building 2, first floor.

120
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:33,834
(Seoyeon pinned building two, first floor)
See? The same place.

121
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,317
She doesn't want to move her stuff.

122
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,916
Anyone want to room with me?

123
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:42,914
No one?

124
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,449
Maybe they don't dare to say it

125
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,623
in public.

126
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:49,058
Honestly, I was relieved it was Seoyeon

127
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,216
who had the roommate swap power.

128
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:53,643
Because I don't know Seoyeon's feelings,

129
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,915
she never told me who

130
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:58,016
she wanted to share a room with.

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,837
Wherever I went,

132
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,715
I wasn’t totally confident.

133
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:05,039
First, then,

134
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,170
I'll choose someone who

135
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,537
was also born in 1993.

136
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,219
(Shocked)

137
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,433
Heeyoung.

138
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,045
- Me?
- Yes.

139
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:14,174
This combo’s fun!

140
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,508
Chosen by the Queen, the Queen chose.

141
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,006
(Satisfied)

142
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,967
(Building two, first floor
Seoyeon & Heeyoung)

143
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:27,087
I thought ‘Does Seoyeon have
an interest in Heeyoung?’

144
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,198
So I'm even more worried.

145
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:33,198
And I wonder why Seoyeon chose me.

146
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:35,851
She once told me she voted for me

147
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:38,084
as best first impression.

148
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:39,339
When I went on

149
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:40,518
my first date that first day,

150
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,361
Seoyeon said she was very tired.

151
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,942
And there was a little bit of

152
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,536
a thought like, 'I want to do well?'

153
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,248
Because we’re good

154
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,054
conversation partners,

155
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:52,011
maybe she picked me with that feeling.

156
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,016
Either way, I was happy

157
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:54,077
with the first floor.

158
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,724
I liked being near the bathroom.

159
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:58,715
- The first floor?
- The first floor.

160
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,602
I didn’t want to use stairs either.

161
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:03,139
You two hate stairs?

162
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,143
- I don't like the attic.
- It's okay.

163
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,124
I like the first floor.

164
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:08,406
You like the first floor?

165
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:11,514
I’ll match whatever you want.

166
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:14,550
(And Minwoo's room?)

167
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,510
(As desired
Building one, first floor Minwoo)

168
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,806
So excited.

169
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:25,513
So excited, the taste of waiting.

170
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,201
You said it doesn’t matter, right?

171
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,123
It doesn’t.

172
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:34,035
Everyone’s broken now.

173
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:37,527
But the taste of power is really good.

174
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,413
I'm going crazy with jealousy.

175
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,411
If you want something, make it known!

176
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:42,457
People are trembling just

177
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:43,612
from my movement.

178
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:47,581
- Moving my stuff, I...
- Second floor.

179
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,568
But that's the first building.

180
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:57,905
(Queen Seoyeon's decision?)

181
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:00,905
(Building one, second floor Dagyo)
Dagyo?

182
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,897
- Dagyo on second floor.
- Yes.

183
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,233
I like being closer to the gym,

184
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:09,169
so the first building’s better.

185
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:10,906
Do you like the first building?

186
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,605
First floor’s better? Second floor?

187
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:15,299
Okay.

188
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,535
(Worried)

189
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:19,723
First of all, I want to

190
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:20,965
stay in the first floor.

191
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:22,523
I’ve already shared a room
with Heeyoung.

192
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:23,541
I honestly wanted to try

193
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:24,619
rooming with Mirang.

194
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:32,883
Wait. You’re good at this.

195
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:35,182
As expected of the PD.

196
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,489
You're really serious.

197
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:38,353
I can't see the writing from here.

198
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:42,212
(Building one, second floor,
Mirang & Dagyo)

199
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,633
What is this? An angel.

200
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:45,570
I’m really satisfied.

201
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,828
It's what I want to do the most,

202
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,183
because we hadn’t had time

203
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,237
to talk one-on-one,

204
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,539
talking to each other

205
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:53,305
is my main purpose.

206
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:56,666
I wasn’t sure how Seoyeon really felt.

207
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,095
She wanted to go on a date with me,

208
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,480
then wouldn't it be right

209
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,940
to keep us separate?

210
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:02,785
Why did you put us in the same room?

211
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:03,984
I was curious about that.

212
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,356
But I ended up in the same room as

213
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:06,690
the person I wanted to stay with.

214
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,031
So I was satisfied.

215
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,836
Honestly,

216
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:13,375
around that time

217
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:15,125
I was giving up on Dagyo.

218
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:16,322
The biggest reason for me

219
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,678
was the sketchbook.

220
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:20,490
This is an important event

221
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:22,924
that would help me move on.

222
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,960
It's a difference that

223
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:27,651
I want to have something

224
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:31,781
that can be clearly summed up.

225
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:34,304
And then the lucky clover appeared.

226
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:36,909
So I asked Mirang,

227
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,696
if you could switch roommates,

228
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:44,626
would you want to be with Dagyo?

229
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,256
She said yes,

230
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:49,836
so I paired them up.

231
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,665
Anyone else want first floor?

232
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,501
I’ll take the second floor.

233
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,638
Okay, second floor.

234
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,053
Me too.

235
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,661
Hangyeol

236
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,395
is begging.

237
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,499
Jeong Hangyeol.

238
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:10,510
But in the end, it’s all up to Seoyeon.

239
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:25,839
(Building two, second floor
Riwon & Hangyeol)

240
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,174
You're the only one left, right, Jinah?

241
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:30,350
Just write Jinah's name.

242
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:35,534
(Building one, first floor,
Minwoo & Jinah)

243
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,272
I ended up with Jinah,

244
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,356
she was crying with Heeyoung,

245
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,611
I thought it would be more

246
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,689
comforting to keep my rival close.

247
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,326
That way I can see everything clearly

248
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:50,543
and plan my strategy more easily.

249
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:52,224
That’s what I thought.

250
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:54,449
Let’s go with that.

251
00:10:57,262 --> 00:10:58,556
I tried to resolve it as

252
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:00,198
democratically as possible

253
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:02,640
by listening to everyone's opinions.

254
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,215
I'm trying to be a merciful king.

255
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,876
But moving luggage would be difficult.

256
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:12,362
Luckily I'm in the first building.

257
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,948
(Building one, first floor Son Minwoo & Kim Jinah
second floor Park Dagyo & Kim Mirang)

258
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:15,441
(Building two, first floor Kim Seoyeon & Park Heeyoung
second floor Kim Riwon & Jeong Hangyeol)

259
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,724
(Roommates at Together House
have changed)

260
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,721
(On the other side, Jinah...)

261
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:31,285
(Jinah who staying in
building one alone)

262
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:36,995
(Feeling uneasy)

263
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,137
Seoyeon could decide

264
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,718
roommates on her own,

265
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,048
but since I wasn’t there, I was curious.

266
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,136
To be honest,

267
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,329
I was also scared that I might end up

268
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:50,820
sharing a room with Heeyoung again.

269
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,608
A lot of different feelings came up.

270
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:55,921
Does Seoyeon have feelings for Heeyoung?

271
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,252
No one knows that

272
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:58,134
I have feelings for someone?

273
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,158
Who?

274
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:01,391
Jinah.

275
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,981
(Minwoo who wonders about
Jinah's feelings for Heeyoung)

276
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,405
I'm dying to know.

277
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:06,430
We kept barging into

278
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:07,652
the first building.

279
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,004
I like being in

280
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,518
the first building together.

281
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,958
The first building? Oh, us.

282
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,031
Now I don’t have to keep

283
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,167
barging in anymore.

284
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:20,486
I’m so lucky to be

285
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:22,509
sharing a room with Jinah.

286
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:23,972
I just got more curious.

287
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:27,369
What was the reason she couldn't attend?

288
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:29,048
What kind of situation was it?

289
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,321
Because it also involved someone I like.

290
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:35,608
I was curious and wanted to understand.

291
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:41,817
I'm so tired.

292
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:43,855
Thank goodness we’re on the first floor.

293
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:46,914
- The second floor.
- The second floor, indeed.

294
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:54,298
Jinah, we’re roommates now.

295
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,387
We’re in the same room.

296
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,647
Minwoo came in and said
"I’m your new roommate."

297
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,955
I was so happy.

298
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,350
The Minwoo I know

299
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,153
had a sharp first impression,

300
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:07,136
but I saw a softness

301
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,608
within that sharpness.

302
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,370
She seemed like someone

303
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,227
with the strength to stay neutral.

304
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:17,835
I was really happy it was Minwoo.

305
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:19,390
(Building one, second floor Dagyo & Mirang)
What about me?

306
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,348
(Building one, second floor Dagyo & Mirang)
Should I take the bed inside?

307
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,289
- Mm, then I'll take the inside bed.
- I'll take any bed.

308
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,982
This is the first time you've ordered me

309
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,356
to do such a dangerous job.

310
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,442
What? I'm like that.

311
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:34,312
It's not like I'm sitting down working.

312
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:37,162
Now I can put on makeup here.

313
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,592
Now that I think about it, I wanted to

314
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,306
try staying in the second floor.

315
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:42,408
- Me too, but...
- I've never stayed on the second floor.

316
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:45,528
(Huffing)
I'm so tired.

317
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,472
Is that too much panting?

318
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,732
The cushion definitely feels different.

319
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:58,804
You're right.

320
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,449
(Dagyo takes a photo in the newly changed room)

321
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:03,976
So cool.

322
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,787
You look cool when you're taking photos.

323
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:11,509
I bought this recently to take photos.

324
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:12,520
Let’s take them tonight,

325
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,074
I’ll take them for you.

326
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,261
Mm. Please take a picture of me

327
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:16,368
when I'm putting on makeup.

328
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:17,822
I’ll take it for you.

329
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:27,656
(Together House
Successfully moved houses)

330
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,293
(Jinah enters the room after Heeyoung)

331
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:51,172
(Unlike other rooms, where a suffocating
silence hangs between two people)

332
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,235
It’s so nice having a 1:1 room.

333
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,640
When there were 3 people in the room,

334
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,707
there weren't enough beds.

335
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,437
(Minwoo tries to change the atmosphere)

336
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:01,813
This is happiness. It really is.

337
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:05,538
Dagyo and Mirang moved up here too.

338
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,705
This place will get noisy now.

339
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:10,452
We’re now divided into 4-on-4.

340
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:16,026
I really wanted to have a 1:1 room.

341
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:17,826
This is my first time too.

342
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:19,282
Honestly, I

343
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:23,735
wanted a single or a 1:1 room so badly.

344
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,669
(The atmosphere gradually improves)
Happiness came my way.

345
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:26,789
(From Minwoo's efforts)

346
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,149
When Jinah looked like

347
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:31,494
she was about to cry,

348
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:34,490
so I didn’t want to just leave her out.

349
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,826
I was curious, and I wanted her

350
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:37,812
to open up and tell me about that.

351
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,007
Personally, when I saw

352
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,812
you sitting there looking all pouty...

353
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:43,709
Did you just laugh?

354
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,077
You looked so cute.

355
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,583
People who see you that way

356
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:47,789
tend to find it charming.

357
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,713
No, it wasn’t that I was pouting.

358
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:51,290
I just didn’t want to get in

359
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:52,808
the way of the others’ activities.

360
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,128
No, I didn’t mean to

361
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,580
say "pouting" like that.

362
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,811
It’s just your lips were

363
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,146
sticking out like this.

364
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,548
And you were gently typing,

365
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,024
it looked cute.

366
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:05,673
I was holding back tears,

367
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,604
(Minwoo & Jinah
unknowingly become closer)

368
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:08,858
scared I might cry.

369
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:12,133
One of my missions coming here was,

370
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:15,619
I've never been attracted

371
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:17,324
to people with long hair.

372
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,587
Since I'm a sports announcer,

373
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,699
so I was always around athletes.

374
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,787
So, I wanted to try dating someone

375
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,575
with a different appearance.

376
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,599
That was Heeyoung.

377
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,411
But yesterday

378
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:33,602
wasn’t really about romantic problem.

379
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,899
It’s just that

380
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,461
she didn’t say a word to me.

381
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:39,761
The only time she said anything

382
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:40,866
was when you entered.

383
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,922
But then, once she said it,

384
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,714
you left.

385
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,360
I was like, "Did I lose something?"

386
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:49,361
Then...

387
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:51,096
(No expression)

388
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,718
- Really?
- Yes, I've been through that a lot.

389
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:55,752
I didn't show that I was being wronged.

390
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:57,538
I just... Firstly,

391
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,321
So since I was playing go-kart,

392
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,927
I've been drawing out a lot of energy.

393
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:06,328
So I was so stressed and anxious.

394
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,088
(Jinah vents her feelings to Minwoo)
All day long, I've been looking

395
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,239
for a place to sit and

396
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,733
talk until I feel stressed.

397
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:15,887
Because you feel compelled to avoid it,

398
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,688
the sadness only deepens.

399
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,592
(Nods)

400
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:22,100
From a detached

401
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,518
third-person perspective,

402
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,719
these human connections,

403
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,758
these matters of love,

404
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:27,253
they stem purely from the heart.

405
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:29,164
To fear, to weep,

406
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:30,682
to care this much?

407
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,152
Even about the smallest things?

408
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,753
Truthfully, priorities exist,

409
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:34,765
don’t they?

410
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,798
But the more we fixate on one thing,

411
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:39,227
the less we notice everything else.

412
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,684
- Will you understand when you're older?
- Yes.

413
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,834
Especially in this kind of situation,

414
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,254
most people charge toward their goal.

415
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:49,503
But you care about everything.

416
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,814
And worry a lot.

417
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:54,390
(Minwoo thinks and sympathizes with Mina who is suffering)
Personally, that kind of character,

418
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,165
it's not that it's bad, it's like...

419
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:59,470
Even if someone misunderstands her,

420
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,913
that misunderstanding still seems cute.

421
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:07,163
If I cried like that,

422
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,596
I’d just get bullied.

423
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,092
But if you cry, people just think,

424
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,794
"Oh, Jinah’s crying."

425
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,491
That’s just how you are.

426
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,381
So I think you should just be yourself.

427
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,475
Cry, worry, go on a date if you want,

428
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,276
don’t if you don’t want to.

429
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:25,567
If you want to get to know someone,

430
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:26,452
gather your courage.

431
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,122
If not now, when will you
gather your courage?

432
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,147
We came here to do that.

433
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,756
I’ve received so much compassion.

434
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:34,024
It’s been a truly

435
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:35,485
comforting time for me.

436
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,545
I also discovered a new side

437
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,303
of Heeyoung I didn’t know.

438
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,381
And Jinah, too.

439
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,886
She just wanted to look good

440
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:44,892
in front of someone she liked.

441
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,886
That's how I feel.

442
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,076
(Is there no one here?)

443
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,765
(Mirang is restless after
changing roommates.)

444
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:07,619
(What are you worried about?)

445
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:15,716
(To Mirang. I like you. Worried)

446
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:26,551
(Then Mirang went back to the room)

447
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,843
You didn't write me a letter, did you?

448
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:30,280
Me?

449
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,177
It's a secret.

450
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:37,540
Did you get a letter today?

451
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,252
Did you get a lot yesterday?

452
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:43,770
It's a secret.

453
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:47,175
You said it was a secret.

454
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:52,067
No, I don't know. I really don't know.

455
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:56,525
But you keep saying you don't know,

456
00:19:56,525 --> 00:20:00,207
was yesterday’s note the most confusing?

457
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,910
Was it the most unpredictable?

458
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,037
Because I kept thinking only about you.

459
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,231
So I didn't think about

460
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,856
any other feelings.

461
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,481
So after getting that letter yesterday,

462
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:14,839
you're like this after thinking it over?

463
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,146
Mm. I don’t know for sure.

464
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:22,021
Maybe I misunderstood something.

465
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,097
It might be a misunderstanding.

466
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:30,735
My mood went up, then suddenly down.

467
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:31,984
I just wanted to talk about it.

468
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,934
(Bad mood?)

469
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,729
(Worried)

470
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:40,451
How do you usually show

471
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,895
interest in someone you like?

472
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,354
Me? Once I've decided,

473
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:45,454
I'll show it directly.

474
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:49,002
So it’s not confusing?

475
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,669
("Mm")

476
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:52,806
But now...

477
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,413
But when you said you didn’t feel great

478
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:55,527
about switching rooms,

479
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:01,801
I don't know.
I don't feel good about it.

480
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,109
Why are you crying?

481
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,099
Who said I was in a bad mood?

482
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,732
- You did.
- I did?

483
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:14,353
I said I was in a bad mood?

484
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:17,570
No. When did I say that? I didn’t.

485
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:25,830
You said it.

486
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,499
Where? When?

487
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:29,721
After changing rooms, you said

488
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:30,649
you were happy at first,

489
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:31,971
but then suddenly weren’t.

490
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:35,237
No. It was just a misunderstanding.

491
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:41,903
You were clearly happy

492
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,378
about changing rooms,

493
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,649
but then your mood suddenly dropped?

494
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:47,123
When you said that, it made

495
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:48,878
my feelings really complicated.

496
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:50,941
Or am I sensitive?

497
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,313
It's a place where people’s feelings

498
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,645
can change overnight.

499
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,552
I'm quite worried about that.

500
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,508
It really hurts my heart.

501
00:21:57,508 --> 00:22:00,992
Although it hurts me to see her cry,

502
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:02,375
I've been thinking about a lot

503
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,114
of things for a long time.

504
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:05,632
It seems like she's so confused

505
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:06,815
that tears are falling out.

506
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,277
Did I say that?

507
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,127
That's why I was so worried.

508
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,010
After I finished writing about our room,

509
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:18,350
did I say that right away?

510
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,561
No, just a moment ago.

511
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,980
Just a moment ago?

512
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,196
It’s not that I was upset

513
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:25,882
about changing rooms.

514
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:29,134
I thought I got a letter from you.

515
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:34,027
But then I asked you about it,

516
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:36,314
and you said it was a secret, right?

517
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:40,142
I thought that letter was from you.

518
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:41,969
I was genuinely happy this morning.

519
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,290
And that letter,

520
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,512
I started thinking, maybe

521
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:50,484
that letter wasn’t from you after all.

522
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,798
So if you didn’t give me the letter,

523
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:57,544
you gave it to someone else.

524
00:22:58,593 --> 00:22:59,831
That’s what 'My mood went up,

525
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,381
then suddenly down.’ meant.

526
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,062
I like being in the same room as you.

527
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:07,534
I think we’ll have a lot of

528
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,421
conversations tonight too,

529
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,725
so I like it.

530
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:12,771
I know.

531
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,165
I just wanted to say it out.

532
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:17,055
I did that because I was worried.

533
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:20,647
I don't think you would mind.

534
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:24,520
If you look upset, I'll be worried.

535
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,357
(Both of them had misunderstood each other)
Why are you crying?

536
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:28,008
Because I was confused.

537
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:31,802
Because I was sad.

538
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:32,824
Anyway,

539
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,485
we haven’t come to

540
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:38,269
a definite conclusion yet,

541
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,942
but since we talked,

542
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,897
things have smoothed over.

543
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:47,192
But like that matter.

544
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:49,604
If I share something with someone...

545
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,280
If someone keeps making me

546
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,381
question things,

547
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:55,005
I don’t try that hard with them either.

548
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:58,734
I know.

549
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:01,781
That could mean two things.

550
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:07,409
One, I want you to express myself more.

551
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,023
Another meaning is secret.

552
00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:11,217
Secret?

553
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,587
You like secrets, don’t you?

554
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,577
I don’t like secrets.
That was my first secret.

555
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:16,350
How do I like secrets?

556
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,537
- I...
- Just once?

557
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:18,675
Do you think I like secrets?

558
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,064
Would I have been that honest with

559
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,180
you yesterday if I liked secrets?

560
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:22,265
But I want to clear up

561
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,548
a misunderstanding.

562
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:25,273
Instead of misunderstanding,

563
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:26,706
yesterday, you and I

564
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:28,339
talked about this and that.

565
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,743
But really I didn't lie.

566
00:24:30,743 --> 00:24:32,181
If one were to speak indirectly,

567
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,637
I would...

568
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,724
Do you think I was being indirect?

569
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,225
I think I was being indirect.

570
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:40,850
Just making it clear.

571
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,511
Not for you to tell me how you feel.

572
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:44,494
Suddenly saying A, saying B,

573
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,363
saying C, and then saying A again.

574
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,306
'Feeling guilty towards me?'

575
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:51,709
'Do you like me?'

576
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:52,736
'Asking for caring?'

577
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm direct with those things.

578
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:56,644
I don't understand.

579
00:24:58,426 --> 00:25:00,595
But in that situation,

580
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:03,365
'Honestly, I don't understand.'

581
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:06,440
You can't say that, can you?

582
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,443
So that's the reason

583
00:25:08,444 --> 00:25:10,577
I kept thinking about it alone.

584
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:14,802
To be clear, I told Heeyoung and you

585
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:16,598
that I have feelings for you.

586
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:18,791
So I wrote you a letter

587
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,295
and went on a date with you.

588
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:22,078
That's why I wanted to ask if

589
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:24,093
it was okay to try dating Heeyoung.

590
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:25,893
And you were saying it’s fine.

591
00:25:25,893 --> 00:25:27,332
‘I went on a date with you too,’

592
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:28,937
'I want to try dating that person too'

593
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,166
Like that, right?

594
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,859
Or 'I like Heeyoung more than you.'

595
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:36,527
I've never tried dating Heeyoung.

596
00:25:36,527 --> 00:25:38,263
We’re all here to explore.

597
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:39,932
So I wanted to ask if it was okay to go

598
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:40,937
if the chance came.

599
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,060
Something like that.

600
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,292
If I said I didn’t like it,

601
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:45,309
would you not go?

602
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:49,091
If you said you didn’t like it?

603
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,737
I won't do it now.

604
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,034
You won't let me date?

605
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,655
I don't want you to date.

606
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:08,784
Got it.

607
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:12,845
I thought I wasn’t a jealous person,

608
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:14,736
but maybe I am.

609
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:20,330
(Time to check the relationship again)

610
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:24,163
I felt like she chose me over Heeyoung,

611
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,662
and I was thankful for those words.

612
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:48,989
(Seoyeon sends a message somewhere)

613
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:58,072
(After sending the message
she gets ready to go out in a good mood)

614
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:00,660
Hey, didn't you hear?

615
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:05,989
What?

616
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,017
(Seoyeon chooses Mirang as her 1:1 date)

617
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:15,866
(Mirang, please prepare the food to bring
to the snack party with Seoyeon.)

618
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:19,690
(Tonight, there will be a snack party
prepared with your roommates.)

619
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:23,610
(Dagyo, please prepare the food to
bring to the snack party with Heeyoung.)

620
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,912
Was I the only one who didn’t get that?

621
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:28,423
- What?
- But why Seoyeon?

622
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:30,176
Seoyeon has the date request ticket

623
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,274
and use it to request

624
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,291
a 1-on-1 date with you, right?

625
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:36,349
Yeah, why? Because of the clover pick?

626
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,160
Right, Seoyeon won the room pick

627
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,836
- and date request.
- Oh, right.

628
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:44,100
- Seoyeon invited you on a date.
- Ah, right.

629
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,931
- What a hottie.
- Geez.

630
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,413
(Mirang who goes another way
due to Seoyeon's date request)

631
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,485
I wasn’t thinking anything.

632
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,756
(Sulking)
You told me not to go on a date,

633
00:27:56,756 --> 00:27:58,566
but you're the one who's going.

634
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:01,388
- What are you doing?
- What a timing.

635
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,642
- What?
- Seriously.

636
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,551
You can't stop me from going on a date.

637
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:07,693
Take care.

638
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,422
(Dagyo who goes on a date with
Seoyeon's roommate, Heeyoung)

639
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,393
Going on a date.

640
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:15,219
Seoyeon chose Mirang for a 1-on-1 date.

641
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,874
Originally, we only dated

642
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:18,099
with roommates.

643
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:21,182
But she picked Mirang instead.

644
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,460
So I'm left with Heeyoung.

645
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,312
We're going on a date?

646
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,960
This situation was just so funny.

647
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,243
Just a minute ago,

648
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,266
"Today, I won't go on a date."

649
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:31,669
Because she said so.

650
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,830
I thought that and

651
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,520
suddenly we're going on a date.

652
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:37,642
This situation feels like a drama.

653
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:40,130
Someone who didn’t have any thoughts

654
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,870
was suddenly requested on a 1-on-1 date.

655
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,531
I want to know what kind of feeling

656
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:46,575
she had when she invited me on a date.

657
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,033
Didn’t you say you were

658
00:28:48,056 --> 00:28:49,400
touched by the letter yesterday?

659
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:51,018
The answer must be in here.

660
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:52,880
There must be a letter from Seoyeon.

661
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,207
Let's put that feeling aside for now.

662
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:57,832
What we were talking earlier...

663
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:00,189
(Mirang's confused that she stammered)

664
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,534
Mm, is that so?

665
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:04,091
Take care.

666
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:08,228
Then why did you and I...

667
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:09,541
Right?

668
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,023
(Guilty, confused)

669
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:20,570
I have something I want to unravel

670
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:21,892
about that incident.

671
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,707
About the event where both Dagyo

672
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,572
and I drew the same card.

673
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,013
Maybe some things had

674
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,705
built up for a long time.

675
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,180
I just wanted to stir things up

676
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,317
for no reason.

677
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:33,934
I just want to attack.

678
00:29:34,158 --> 00:29:36,972
When do we go out?

679
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:39,865
Singing because of the date ticket, huh?

680
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,092
(Having fun)

681
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:45,299
Originally, did you have to make

682
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,375
a snack party? You can just buy it.

683
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,106
Just prepare the food, right?

684
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:52,527
Then order it and go get it.

685
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:54,748
What do you want to get?

686
00:29:54,748 --> 00:29:57,136
I want hotpot and

687
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:58,817
Vietnamese spring rolls.

688
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:00,921
Spring rolls?

689
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:01,917
I really love them.

690
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,298
I bet no one else will pick the same.

691
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,887
(Busy women before the snack party)

692
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,182
What is it?

693
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,985
It's a snack party.

694
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,445
Oh, this one.

695
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:15,127
Pajama party.

696
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,672
But now that I said it,
I feel a bit relieved.

697
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:19,596
What are we making?

698
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:27,051
(What kind of changes will a snack party
with a new roommate bring to them?)

699
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:38,854
(Seoyeon & Mirang leave first)

700
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:53,029
Why do you think I asked you on a date?

701
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,635
I thought two things.

702
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,260
The first is

703
00:30:57,277 --> 00:31:00,838
‘Are you interested in me?’

704
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:01,898
The other is,

705
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,139
‘Is it because it’s comfortable?’

706
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,968
We’ve talked a lot.

707
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,470
Mm.

708
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,451
So...

709
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:13,732
It made me want to ask you too.

710
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:16,615
But whether it was reason one or two,

711
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:20,097
by asking you out,

712
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:23,185
you already have Dagyo.

713
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:24,457
Then it's a choice that doesn't

714
00:31:24,457 --> 00:31:25,462
take into account

715
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,017
the relationship with Dagyo.

716
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,345
What do you think about that part?

717
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,865
- But...
- Isn’t that a really bad move?

718
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:33,038
Not really.

719
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:36,860
We came here to date and meet a lover.

720
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:42,252
- The choice is yours.
- Mm.

721
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:44,542
I always tell people here not to be

722
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,482
overly conscious of others.

723
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:51,241
So I hope you don’t feel

724
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:53,313
pressured because of that.

725
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:57,252
Why are you most worried about that?

726
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:58,880
Worried about what?

727
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,351
- Dagyo.
- No.

728
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:04,538
- And me.
- No.

729
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:14,976
(Seoyeon dives into her thoughts
after talking to Mirang)

730
00:32:18,072 --> 00:32:20,893
(What was the reason why Seoyeon
invited Mirang to date?)

731
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:31,929
(What is the place where
Mirang and Seoyeon come?)

732
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:37,860
- What is this?
- Cake.

733
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,163
(Date, a craft shop that makes cakes
with your favorite ingredients)

734
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,452
Making cakes?

735
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,561
- Have you ever made a cake?
- Never.

736
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:48,637
(Smiles)

737
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:54,731
(The two start making a pie from Jeju oranges)
I made the blue one.

738
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:57,003
Orange pie.

739
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:59,894
This is my first time making it.

740
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:05,619
There's a yogurt smell.

741
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:06,744
Yeah.

742
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:08,383
- You already made this?
- Yeah.

743
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:13,385
But I have a question.

744
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:15,612
Earlier when we chose the card,

745
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:16,782
that day,

746
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:18,986
I chose the same card,

747
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:21,701
why didn't you promise me that day?

748
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:22,784
Why did you suddenly pick

749
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:24,404
the same card as Dagyo?

750
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:26,478
(Curious)

751
00:33:26,478 --> 00:33:31,424
Well, it was the first day,

752
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:32,802
I was confident in Dagyo.

753
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,530
Because that's not it.

754
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,733
So when you said you liked Dagyo,

755
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:42,893
we hadn't known each other for long,

756
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:44,889
and I wasn’t sure about my feelings,

757
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,469
‘Oh, so that's how it is’

758
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:49,153
We like the same person.

759
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:52,135
That’s literally all I thought.

760
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:54,373
Mm.

761
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,349
But...

762
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:00,636
when I gave you that advice,

763
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:02,769
I thought you were going to say

764
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,474
or promise me something.

765
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:07,182
But there's that line.

766
00:34:07,182 --> 00:34:11,991
‘I’m definitely going on a date
with Dagyo today.’

767
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:15,301
On the first day, I really didn’t know.

768
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,154
Honestly, I didn’t even know

769
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,846
we were going on a date.

770
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:21,702
There was that situation.

771
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:22,713
But

772
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:24,902
that day,

773
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,057
I did initially want to

774
00:34:26,058 --> 00:34:27,613
go out with Jinah.

775
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,175
Oh really?

776
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:32,011
I decided. That night...

777
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:33,502
But Dagyo just stood out more

778
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:34,658
than Jinah that day.

779
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:38,367
If someone else had

780
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,274
really caught my eye,

781
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:41,610
I would’ve tried with that person.

782
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,314
But the feeling is the same.

783
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:46,946
But at the same time,

784
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:49,073
(Mirang who Dagyo came into view first)
what I gave that person

785
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:50,618
(Mirang who Dagyo came into view first)
to another person.

786
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,902
I didn't want to show my feelings.

787
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:56,480
So, does that mean

788
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:58,630
I don't care about anything?

789
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,983
I like Dagyo.

790
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:06,446
That's why I gave you the advice.

791
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:09,888
- But I, I mean,
- I'll sprinkle it for you.

792
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:12,828
I don't know if you like him or not.

793
00:35:12,853 --> 00:35:14,653
Plus, it was the first day.

794
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:16,690
I didn't know how deep her feelings are.

795
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,564
I thought it was just a little crush.

796
00:35:19,808 --> 00:35:22,171
You were open with me,

797
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:24,325
but I wasn’t open with you,

798
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:26,868
that was our issue.

799
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,956
Because I also...

800
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:30,603
(Mirang doesn't hide her feelings)
Just seeing Dagyo,

801
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:34,123
(If only Dagyo comes into her sight)
I'd say that I like her.

802
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:36,145
But I really didn’t feel

803
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:37,268
that way at the time.

804
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,442
I only went out with her

805
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,886
because I liked her so much.

806
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,969
‘I had to date this person.’

807
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:42,927
That wasn’t it.

808
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:46,310
Also, it wasn’t just you.

809
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,781
I’ve heard everything, everyone was

810
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,588
sharing who they were interested in.

811
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,768
Honestly, after hearing all this,

812
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:52,895
I couldn’t remember who said

813
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:53,934
what about whom.

814
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:57,902
So I thought, ‘Let’s not overthink it,

815
00:35:57,902 --> 00:35:59,344
just date who you like.’

816
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:02,424
I was that simple before.

817
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:04,718
Have you been

818
00:36:04,718 --> 00:36:07,485
worried about that all along?

819
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:13,571
There's no older sister around me.

820
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:14,649
You’re the first person

821
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,404
I called "unni" (older sister),

822
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,786
the first person I really relied on

823
00:36:21,786 --> 00:36:25,304
in the house for advice.

824
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:30,326
- That’s why…
- You felt kind of betrayed.

825
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:34,969
I felt betrayed.

826
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:40,461
That might be my own problem.

827
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:43,742
What I don't think is hard to say,

828
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:46,006
I think that's the truth.

829
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:47,842
I’m simple,

830
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:51,391
and I assumed others were too.

831
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,452
I didn’t realize you were

832
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:54,983
thinking so deeply.

833
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,744
Today I came out and heard from you

834
00:36:58,744 --> 00:37:00,424
honestly.

835
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:02,107
To be honest,

836
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,681
there's no need to be wary of me.

837
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:05,833
You didn’t come here to find

838
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:07,002
a close big sister, did you?

839
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,555
Even though I didn't come

840
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:13,235
to find a close sister.

841
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,884
Just you...

842
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,974
I don't know, just you...

843
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:24,576
I like you a lot.

844
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:29,096
You as a sister.

845
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:31,718
(Reluctant)

846
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:35,293
I like you both as a sister figure,

847
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:36,764
and right after Dagyo,

848
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,358
you are the person

849
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,358
I am most drawn to romantically.

850
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:52,198
So saying this now is really sudden

851
00:37:52,198 --> 00:37:57,040
and probably confusing for you, right?

852
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,581
Both confused and puzzled.

853
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:07,475
It’s probably because I’m not simple.

854
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:10,356
I wish you'd been more direct.

855
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:14,060
So I could know that you feel this way.

856
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,140
I've got some faults in that too.

857
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,420
Apologies?

858
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,495
Yeah, I'm sorry.

859
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,141
Certainly, I'm a bit clueless.

860
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,652
Dagyo and I are getting along well?

861
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:27,610
As I said before,

862
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,912
just...

863
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:32,648
I never meant to annoy you.

864
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,461
It’s just since you were my roommate,

865
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:40,322
I had no one else to talk to,

866
00:38:40,324 --> 00:38:42,329
I felt like I could
speak freely with you.

867
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,369
Without realizing how

868
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,419
it might make you feel.

869
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:52,924
I just want you to feel comfortable.

870
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:55,512
It's like throwing a rock

871
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:59,312
into a quiet lake.

872
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:03,683
I feel guilty towards Seoyeon.

873
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,337
Are you saying you didn’t send

874
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:06,493
that letter to me yesterday?

875
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,237
I’ve always been

876
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:10,923
sending letters to Dagyo.

877
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:16,350
Then the day before yesterday…

878
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,144
I was quite.

879
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:21,215
(Tears)

880
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:22,476
Quite...

881
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:24,412
Hurt?

882
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:28,443
I don’t know. Perhaps.

883
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:33,791
Maybe that card thing was a big deal.

884
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:39,551
I just wanted to

885
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:42,075
throw a stone into your heart.

886
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:44,945
What?

887
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:46,664
Hang out?

888
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:47,906
I just wanted to throw

889
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,578
a stone into your heart.

890
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:53,927
I just...

891
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,366
wanted to shake you up a bit.

892
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,889
So…

893
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:06,238
- Is that why you wrote it?
- Mm.

894
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:10,292
I'm as shaken up as you want me to be.

895
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:12,886
I think I ended up hurting you.

896
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:17,655
I'm just really clueless sometimes.

897
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,227
I’ve been talking to you

898
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,105
about Dagyo this whole time,

899
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:24,255
thinking you liked me.

900
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,178
But today I realize

901
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:29,753
maybe I’ve been hurting you all along?

902
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:31,781
I've always felt really bad.

903
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:33,758
It's a really big deal.

904
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:38,407
(Stares, feels)

905
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:45,422
You also like...

906
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:48,790
She couldn't control her expression.

907
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:51,246
Her lips were trembling.

908
00:40:51,642 --> 00:40:55,235
I could feel the confusion.

909
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:57,212
I feel a little hurt.

910
00:40:57,212 --> 00:41:01,425
You see...

911
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,465
Don't beat around the bush.

912
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,199
- What do you mean?
- Dealing with your feelings.

913
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,454
Both neat and smooth.

914
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:10,411
I don't think it's like this.

915
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:13,122
When I look at you, so your feelings...

916
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:17,218
Or do you hate and dislike me?

917
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:18,712
I don't think you know clearly

918
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:20,451
whether I like you or not.

919
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:25,094
- Human feelings...
- I'm confused by your words.

920
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:28,687
It's not that easy.

921
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:40,173
(Seoyeon is confused by feelings
that cannot be easily defined)

922
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:47,509
(Mirang confuses Seoyeon's mind)

923
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,152
Dagyo...

924
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:55,551
In terms of romantic feelings, yes,

925
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:58,667
Dagyo was always my first pick.

926
00:41:58,803 --> 00:42:02,843
But the person I liked more

927
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:04,780
was always you.

928
00:42:05,735 --> 00:42:12,587
(Seoyeon's feelings of caring for
Mirang and liking Dagyo)

929
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:16,253
(Seoyeon's choice that doesn't want
either side to get hurt)

930
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:22,822
You and Dagyo

931
00:42:22,883 --> 00:42:29,580
shared a room together nicely.

932
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,520
I want to know about that too.

933
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:38,355
(Seoyeon's mind is complicated
by her feelings for both of them)

934
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,914
I did it just because.

935
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:48,330
(Cautious)

936
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:50,501
Then why did you keep

937
00:42:50,507 --> 00:42:52,816
sending letters to Dagyo?

938
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:54,442
Because until then,

939
00:42:54,454 --> 00:42:56,310
I won't give up.

940
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,175
- Who?
- Dagyo.

941
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,839
Therefore, the moment I give up,

942
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,537
when I sent you a 'like' letter.

943
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:14,889
Now I understand.

944
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:21,485
(Seoyeon carefully vents
her complicated feelings)

945
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:28,096
That is the sign of me giving up.

946
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:32,144
So, you have feelings

947
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:35,850
for two people here.

948
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,034
But now those two are

949
00:43:38,944 --> 00:43:40,624
doing well together.

950
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,422
And you’re just watching them.

951
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:44,532
(Nods)

952
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:49,267
But you’ve let go of Dagyo…

953
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,683
The feeling you have for me

954
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:51,722
starts from here.

955
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:55,533
Right?

956
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:58,273
So, ah, I don't know.

957
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:00,530
No, I didn’t “come” to you.

958
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,271
Gosh, it's so awkward.

959
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:07,122
(Seoyeon is uncomfortable with Mirang
who tries to understand.)

960
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:11,252
- Ah, my gosh.
- So...

961
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:14,341
That's why I got revenge on you.

962
00:44:14,341 --> 00:44:16,007
Saying that you're going to get revenge,

963
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:17,357
saying that you like me.

964
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:19,605
I'm so confused.

965
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,621
Confusion is revenge.

966
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:26,183
I want to confuse you.

967
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:27,754
Did you think you could just hurt me

968
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:30,841
and go on living happily?

969
00:44:31,571 --> 00:44:33,338
Ah, dammit.

970
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,565
You have to be confused

971
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:36,085
so it's called revenge.

972
00:44:38,453 --> 00:44:39,750
If you're feeling comfortable,

973
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,629
how can you call it revenge?

974
00:44:41,685 --> 00:44:44,407
Are you acting? Are you an actress?

975
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:45,441
What?

976
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:49,542
I'm going to make you uncomfortable.

977
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:50,680
You still don't understand

978
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:52,208
what I'm saying.

979
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:53,669
I'm getting mad now.

980
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,295
(Bitter)

981
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:58,410
Ah, geez.

982
00:44:58,427 --> 00:45:00,038
I was upset until a moment ago,

983
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:01,409
and now I'm mad.

984
00:45:02,372 --> 00:45:07,105
Seoyeon's regret finally explodes.)

985
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:08,677
Alright, so in the end,

986
00:45:08,694 --> 00:45:10,121
you liked Dagyo so much

987
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:12,262
that you took revenge on me?

988
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:13,852
(Frustrated)

989
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:14,796
So stressful.

990
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:18,707
How are you even dating Dagyo?

991
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:21,418
Volunteering?

992
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,231
What do you mean? We’re not dating yet.

993
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:24,919
Whatever.

994
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:28,540
I don't know. I don’t understand.

995
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,883
You don't seem to get how I feel,

996
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:34,724
and that made me frustrated.

997
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:37,987
That’s how hurt I was.

998
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:41,697
She liked Dagyo all along.

999
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,086
We were talking about that and

1000
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:45,692
suddenly she told me that she liked me.

1001
00:45:48,155 --> 00:45:49,430
Did she say that because

1002
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:51,007
she really likes me?

1003
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:53,262
It's a feeling that

1004
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:55,195
I don't know what it is.

1005
00:45:56,988 --> 00:46:01,551
(A date between two people that is more
confusing than confirming their feelings.)

1006
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:14,916
(Heeyoung & Dagyo walk along the beach.)

1007
00:46:15,477 --> 00:46:17,257
So beautiful.

1008
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,654
But it's so sparkling.

1009
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:20,931
The sun is so strong.

1010
00:46:21,381 --> 00:46:23,741
(The open sea is sparkling.)
The waves are so strong.

1011
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:26,701
The blue looks beautiful.

1012
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:28,245
Today’s the clearest day
since we got here.

1013
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:30,157
(Jeju weather welcomes Heeyoung & Dagyo)

1014
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:32,230
The weather’s the best today.

1015
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:36,579
Today, the color of your outfit matches

1016
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,406
the color of the sea very well.

1017
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:40,915
(Heeyoung's coat coincidentally matches the sea.)

1018
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,338
I thought it was the sea.

1019
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,657
The windmills we saw from our

1020
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:48,400
accommodation was about this size.

1021
00:46:48,424 --> 00:46:50,068
But here, you can see them all.

1022
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:51,209
Is that windmill over there

1023
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:52,442
the one we saw from our place?

1024
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:56,270
Oh, I’m not sure.

1025
00:46:58,619 --> 00:46:59,979
(Dagyo and Heeyoung have
their first date.)

1026
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:03,505
It is windy today.

1027
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:08,529
But the winter sea is very romantic.

1028
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:15,119
- So...
- Mm.

1029
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,724
Today, suddenly,

1030
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:19,063
we’re on our first date.

1031
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:21,492
- How was it?
- How was it?

1032
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:22,573
Is it time already?

1033
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,624
When did you know?

1034
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:25,503
Didn't you get a date invitation text
from me?

1035
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:28,528
Sure, you sent it last night.

1036
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:32,013
And nothing...

1037
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:36,150
- Well...
- Oh, read it yesterday.

1038
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,894
Did you get a lot of letters yesterday?

1039
00:47:38,915 --> 00:47:40,339
(Shakes)

1040
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,045
- Don't you know? Can't you tell me?
- I don't know.

1041
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:44,615
Tell me if you received
a lot or a little?

1042
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:46,073
How does that sound?

1043
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:49,339
Normal? Just average?

1044
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:50,695
I did get some.

1045
00:47:50,695 --> 00:47:57,085
You must have, since I sent one too.

1046
00:47:57,085 --> 00:48:00,379
I thought things were going

1047
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:02,718
really well between you and Mirang.

1048
00:48:03,486 --> 00:48:04,658
So I wondered why you

1049
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,619
sent me one all of a sudden.

1050
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:11,875
On the first day,

1051
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,455
honestly, no one had a clear favorite.

1052
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:15,176
Because I don't really know anyone yet.

1053
00:48:15,176 --> 00:48:18,388
- I didn't go on a date, so I...
- Yeah.

1054
00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:24,814
So I wrote about that down.

1055
00:48:24,814 --> 00:48:27,047
But that night,

1056
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:29,908
after observing things for a day,

1057
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:35,488
my type was Mirang and you.

1058
00:48:35,488 --> 00:48:37,204
(Nods)

1059
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,438
But the next day,

1060
00:48:38,455 --> 00:48:40,321
I went on a date with Mirang.

1061
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,760
And you went with Jinah.

1062
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,923
But you weren't thinking of it at all.

1063
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,114
Since the three of us were roommates,

1064
00:48:49,114 --> 00:48:50,837
while I was hearing things,

1065
00:48:50,837 --> 00:48:52,803
if I wanted to steal you away,

1066
00:48:52,803 --> 00:48:54,036
both of us have to tickle the you

1067
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:55,419
in the center and tear you apart,

1068
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,280
it was possible.

1069
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:57,444
But you’re both good people,

1070
00:48:57,445 --> 00:48:58,844
so there was no reason to do that.

1071
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:00,793
If the two of you really date,

1072
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:02,314
you two will really date.

1073
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:04,358
If I express my feelings again.

1074
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,299
Learning things but the right person

1075
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:07,566
will be the right one.

1076
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:09,702
Yes, yes.

1077
00:49:09,702 --> 00:49:13,058
Well, regardless,

1078
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:16,201
at first I had interest in you two,

1079
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:18,295
but I never said it once.

1080
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,238
I don't think it's about

1081
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:21,936
not sending the letters.

1082
00:49:21,986 --> 00:49:25,557
So you finally sent one to me yesterday?

1083
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:27,334
Mm.

1084
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:29,740
I wanted to be clear so you'd know.

1085
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,813
You kept saying
‘no one liked me.’

1086
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:35,996
That's why I want to tell you

1087
00:49:36,013 --> 00:49:38,225
there are people who are good enough.

1088
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:42,232
You said no so coldly.

1089
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:44,247
No, because I really think that way.

1090
00:49:45,778 --> 00:49:48,562
But you still showed me.

1091
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:51,225
No, there's that but regardless,

1092
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:52,648
I couldn't express because...

1093
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:53,725
Yes, the situation.

1094
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,645
Because the situation is like that again.

1095
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:58,329
Because there is something like that.

1096
00:49:59,745 --> 00:50:02,111
I just think that I...

1097
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:03,859
I don't want regrets.

1098
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:05,079
I feel that way

1099
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,146
so I won't express my feelings.

1100
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,098
So,

1101
00:50:11,098 --> 00:50:13,431
yesterday I asked you out on a date.

1102
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:16,536
Before you go go-karting?

1103
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:19,606
(That's how it is.)

1104
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,356
And the day before, I also told Mirang.

1105
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:23,499
(Shocked)

1106
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,256
I thought it was manners.

1107
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,388
What?

1108
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:30,060
I'm interested in both of you.

1109
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,009
You said you were interested in me?

1110
00:50:32,009 --> 00:50:33,044
I did.

1111
00:50:33,044 --> 00:50:35,577
I think it's the best thing I can do

1112
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:37,838
for someone who was
straightforward to me.

1113
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:39,917
Being direct is good.

1114
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,333
I don't like hiding things

1115
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:42,728
and guard it tightly.

1116
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:44,331
Confusing...

1117
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:46,968
I know I've confused you.

1118
00:50:46,968 --> 00:50:50,419
- But I don't want to be a coward.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1119
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:53,760
But that's what we came here to do.

1120
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,396
I sent it.

1121
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:04,098
When we talked,

1122
00:51:04,098 --> 00:51:05,980
it's two people who feel good
about each other,

1123
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,987
and being honest without any regrets.

1124
00:51:07,987 --> 00:51:09,769
So I’m glad I sent that note

1125
00:51:09,794 --> 00:51:11,508
and made my feelings known.

1126
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,066
So I don't have any lingering doubts.

1127
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:17,126
Thank you very much.

1128
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:18,789
It's fine.

1129
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:22,430
I'm really uncomfortable.

1130
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,595
No.

1131
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:26,751
Of course, 'no' is a lie.

1132
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:29,391
Regardless, hearing from both sides,

1133
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:30,765
the stories from both perspectives

1134
00:51:30,777 --> 00:51:31,897
are different.

1135
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:34,877
Jinah and you went on

1136
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,403
two dates in a row,

1137
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,588
since it's too direct,

1138
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:40,315
so I wasn’t sure if

1139
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:41,844
I could express my feelings.

1140
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:43,406
And the atmosphere

1141
00:51:43,412 --> 00:51:45,212
in the room was very good.

1142
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:46,964
We were so close as roommates,

1143
00:51:46,964 --> 00:51:49,311
and I didn’t want to ruin that.

1144
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,867
When I think about it,

1145
00:51:51,867 --> 00:51:53,005
what I felt about you

1146
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:54,603
really, from deep down

1147
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:56,557
was that you were inherently good.

1148
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:59,981
Now you're someone who knows

1149
00:51:59,981 --> 00:52:05,416
and can read people's feelings so well.

1150
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:07,689
- Me?
- Mm.

1151
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:10,848
So at first, you and I were the same.

1152
00:52:10,848 --> 00:52:14,153
Talking to you is quite fun.

1153
00:52:14,153 --> 00:52:15,694
Thanks.

1154
00:52:15,694 --> 00:52:19,120
Trying this in
a confusing situation for once

1155
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,981
can you call it a place
where you can breathe?

1156
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:22,803
(Dagyo's existence is comforting)
Because you know how to

1157
00:52:22,803 --> 00:52:24,483
(Dagyo's existence is comforting)
handle things broadly,

1158
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,521
even though you always

1159
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:29,699
had feelings for me,

1160
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:32,855
- but can't express it.
- Yes.

1161
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:34,421
I'm just curious. But today,

1162
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:36,361
we are here on a date, right?

1163
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,974
That’s so nice.

1164
00:52:41,368 --> 00:52:44,654
So the letter was worth it.

1165
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:48,400
Thanks.

1166
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,700
So how do you feel now?

1167
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,210
Right now?

1168
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,321
You don’t have to say.

1169
00:52:59,321 --> 00:53:03,582
Then today...

1170
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:05,658
Are you worrying?

1171
00:53:05,658 --> 00:53:08,835
Your thought...

1172
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:11,982
Then let’s just relax today

1173
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,949
and have fun.

1174
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:16,200
Let's date under the pretext

1175
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:17,897
of preparing a party.

1176
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:22,262
Yeah. I wanted to say all this.

1177
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:24,081
And thank you for being honest

1178
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:25,384
with your feelings.

1179
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:26,802
It felt to me like you were saying

1180
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:28,282
all this just to clear things up.

1181
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:30,940
She reacted like

1182
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,499
she'll continuously like me.

1183
00:53:33,499 --> 00:53:35,979
Saying, Ah, really?
Then we laughed together.

1184
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,160
It seems like she’d already

1185
00:53:37,182 --> 00:53:38,715
organized her thoughts beforehand.

1186
00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:41,222
It felt like we're digging into the past

1187
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:44,177
I felt it now that I brought it up.

1188
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:46,309
That made things hard for me.

1189
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:50,889
It’s cold. Should we head in?

1190
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:55,938
Did you not want to come to the sea?

1191
00:53:55,938 --> 00:53:57,983
Don't you want to come?
You're at Jeju Island.

1192
00:53:57,983 --> 00:53:59,371
- I want to go to the sea.
- Right?

1193
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:00,934
I've wanted it for 4 days.

1194
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:04,571
- And today, I just want the sea.
- Yes.

1195
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,521
So fun.

1196
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:08,924
Ah, but seriously, we should’ve

1197
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,675
brought a camera or something.

1198
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:11,736
It's such a shame to only

1199
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:12,814
capture this with our eyes.

1200
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:13,611
What's it called?

1201
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:16,435
It’s a bit of a shame.

1202
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:24,807
(Restaurant for a snack party)

1203
00:54:25,385 --> 00:54:26,847
Here it is.

1204
00:54:28,312 --> 00:54:29,681
Hello.

1205
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:32,075
Hello. Hello.

1206
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:34,069
Since the two of them

1207
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:35,669
are getting dessert,

1208
00:54:36,796 --> 00:54:38,577
One spicy sujebi, one kalguksu,

1209
00:54:38,602 --> 00:54:41,352
two squid pancakes like this.

1210
00:54:41,384 --> 00:54:44,790
(Heeyoung & Dagyo receive their food)
Thank you.

1211
00:54:46,629 --> 00:54:48,128
What is it?

1212
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:49,762
From now on, everyone,

1213
00:54:49,768 --> 00:54:51,551
reveal a secret about yourself.

1214
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:52,987
I’ll go first.

1215
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:54,812
New job is...

1216
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:56,378
My secret is...

1217
00:54:56,821 --> 00:54:59,128
Thank you.

1218
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,698
I...

1219
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,698
(Seoyeon cannot easily speak)

1220
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,940
(Their secret that shocked everyone is?)

1221
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,138
Really?

1222
00:55:11,035 --> 00:55:13,840
(And...)

1223
00:55:14,872 --> 00:55:17,356
(Shocked)

1224
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:22,337
(The night of sending heartfelt messages
with voice, not love letters)

1225
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:25,559
Oh, I'm dying of excitement.

1226
00:55:25,672 --> 00:55:27,997
I don't want to make it confusing today.

1227
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:30,908
No, it's me, Jinah.

1228
00:55:31,347 --> 00:55:34,579
(Where are their hearts headed?)

1229
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,214
Who is it?

1230
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:38,643
Feels like my heart is going to explode.

1231
00:55:39,812 --> 00:55:41,787
Why is it like this?

1232
00:55:45,803 --> 00:55:47,781
Dammit.
