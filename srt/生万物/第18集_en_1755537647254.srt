[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,000
How is she?

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,560
Is the baby safe?

5
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,490
Forgive my limited medical skills.

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
Young Mistress

7
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,420
is not pregnant.

8
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:03,990
That's…

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
impossible.

10
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,740
Did she have a miscarriage?

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,030
Did you have a miscarriage?

12
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,470
She...

13
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,700
She bled.

14
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
Young Mistress

15
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,290
is not pregnant.

16
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,470
And there are no signs of miscarriage.

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,820
The bleeding is merely her period.

18
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
It can't be her period.

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,590
It can't be.

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,160
She hasn't had her period
for quite some time.

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,829
And look.

22
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,350
She…

23
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,570
she's showing.

24
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,470
I've treated cases

25
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,490
like this before.

26
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,870
Some women

27
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,030
believe they're pregnant,

28
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,250
and their periods

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,030
stop due to that belief.

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,960
On top of that,

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,520
staying in bed all day,

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,710
having multiple meals a day,

33
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,640
and overeating,

34
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,750
they start to look
as if they're pregnant.

35
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,630
In truth, she's just put on weight.

36
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,270
Madam,

37
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,200
I'll take my leave now.

38
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,420
I'll see him out.

39
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,710
Qing.

40
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,310
Bring Physician Huo here.

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,750
Qing!

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Madam.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,570
Bring Physician Huo here.

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,240
Madam.

45
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,880
When you asked me to find a physician,

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,760
I first tried to get Physician Huo,

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
but they told me

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,370
that he had returned to his home in town

49
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,150
and hasn't been practicing
for a long time.

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,280
I didn't mean it.

51
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,310
I don't know what happened.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,680
I've always thought this was strange.

53
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,270
It never made sense to me.

54
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,110
So that's what happened.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,020
I didn't want to get involved.

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,910
With permanent tenancy,
I don't want any more trouble.

57
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,680
But I can't just ignore it.

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,480
If the land were taken back again…

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,750
What should I do about this?

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
There's no point asking you.

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,020
You'll just take
your father's side anyway.

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,220
If that's what you really think,

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,880
don't bother asking me at all.

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,470
Xiuxiu,

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,720
do you have any ideas?

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Please help me.

67
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,720
I don't want to quit.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,920
L-Look at you,

69
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,600
totally at a loss.

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,630
You threw a fit as soon as you walked in.

71
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,310
How could you call her Ning Xiuxiu?

72
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,830
Apologize to her now,

73
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,210
so she'll help you figure something out.

74
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,510
X-Xiuxiu, I'm sorry.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,390
What?

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,610
You want to quit?

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,070
Maybe

78
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,830
Dajiao should be the head

79
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,490
of the Farmers' Association.

80
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,720
You're literate and can help him.

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
I can't even read.

82
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,070
What does this say?

83
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,560
I've been busy working in the fields

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,760
and forgotten it all.

85
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,910
I don't know
how to deal with Ning Xuexiang.

86
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,040
Kejin.

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,159
Kejin.

88
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,840
Tietou from the Farmers' Association
is here,

89
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
asking to see you.

90
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
What does he want with me?

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,750
I saw him carrying
the Farmers' Association flag,

92
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,510
so it's probably about the association.

93
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,110
How many people did he bring?

94
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,270
Just himself.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,720
Send him in.

96
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,920
Okay.

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,310
Tietou,

98
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,380
you needed to see me?

99
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,780
You're a literate man.

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,070
I've memorized

101
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,930
every single word of this letter.

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,870
Take a close look.

103
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,640
If Ning Xuexiang dares
to fool the Farmers' Association again…

104
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,520
the county farmers' association
will deal with him.

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,680
What happens then?

106
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,450
That'll be out of my hands.

107
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,300
I'll take my leave now.

108
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,960
What happens
if the farmers' association comes?

109
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,380
When they arrested
Zhang Zongchang's county magistrate,

110
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,520
they used handcuffs

111
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,080
and tied him up tightly.

112
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,190
Son,

113
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,750
is there no way for me to escape this?

114
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,120
Tietou dared
to come to me alone with a flag.

115
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,800
He must have a mastermind behind him.

116
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,760
But this mastermind

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,530
has left you some room to maneuver.

118
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,680
Otherwise, Tietou would've gone straight
to the county farmers' association,

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,070
and we'd have no way out.

120
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,950
Kuangzi.

121
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,240
Master.

122
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,430
Go.

123
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,800
Fetch Tietou for me.

124
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,750
Tell him

125
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,830
I have important matters
to discuss with him.

126
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,700
Young Master.

127
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,840
Madam said she has no appetite

128
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,680
and doesn't want it in her room.

129
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,210
She asked me to bring it out.

130
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,270
What about Young Mistress?

131
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,240
She ate

132
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,720
and then kept crying.

133
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,960
You may go now.

134
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,080
Xiuxiu.

135
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,080
Xiuxiu.

136
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,220
You're really something else!

137
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,070
I'm totally impressed.

138
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,720
What's with you?

139
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,600
What did Xiuxiu do?

140
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,910
Dajiao, let me finish.

141
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,320
Xiuxiu,

142
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,200
didn't you ask me
to give that letter to your brother?

143
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,840
I had been uneasy about it,

144
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,970
constantly worried.

145
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,230
That's treasure to me.

146
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,610
Whether I eat, sleep,
or work in the fields,

147
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,970
I keep it in this pouch
my mother sewed for me.

148
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,630
How could I just give it to him?

149
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,120
But unexpectedly,

150
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
your fathe...

151
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,650
I mean...

152
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,900
Ning Xuexiang…

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,020
he actually

154
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,000
returned the letter to me

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,550
very respectfully.

156
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,370
He even treated me to drinks

157
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,960
and toasted me three times in a row.

158
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,420
Dajiao.

159
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,200
Ning Xuexiang toasted me
three times in a row.

160
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,910
What about the tenancy?

161
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,390
I almost forgot the most important part.

162
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,270
I asked around.

163
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,790
They said those families
with fake permanent tenancies

164
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,650
got real ones from Ning Xuexiang.

165
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,870
Even Glutton Fei

166
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,470
got a permanent tenancy too.

167
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,650
I also went to Mrs. Fei's place.

168
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,720
They said she was sick,

169
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,190
so I had Qing pass on the message.

170
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,950
Qing said

171
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,080
Mrs. Fei told me

172
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,480
to farm my land with peace of mind.

173
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,610
She won't take away my land ever again.

174
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,770
Xiuxiu,

175
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,480
I'm really grateful to you.

176
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Thank you so much.

177
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,740
Well, that's perfect.

178
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,080
Hurry back to your hut
and check on things

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,940
in case it's snatched away again.

180
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,670
No way, no way.

181
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,310
No one's taking my land again.

182
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,910
Alright, Dajiao, Xiuxiu,

183
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,200
you two carry on with your business.

184
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,660
I'm heading to the fields.

185
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,710
Thank you, Xiuxiu.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
What did you do?

187
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,780
I thought something was fishy about this.

188
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,860
Sure enough, they were hiding something.

189
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,920
Tietou's bluff flushed it right out.

190
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,670
B-But…

191
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,000
won't your father come after you for this?

192
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,200
Let him come.

193
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,670
I have questions for him anyway.

194
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,600
This feud between you two—

195
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,150
when will it ever end?

196
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,520
I'll go back to work.

197
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,270
Fei Wendian!

198
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,270
Susu.

199
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,030
Come with me.

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,630
Where to?

201
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,240
Don't sleep here anymore.

202
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,390
Sleep with me in my room.

203
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:40,870
Susu.

204
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,960
What are you doing?

205
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,150
It's not my fault I'm not pregnant.

206
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,120
I really thought I was.

207
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,630
Besides, getting pregnant
isn't that hard.

208
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,720
Your sister-in-law is

209
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,840
acting like I'll never get pregnant again!

210
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,970
I've made up my mind.

211
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,810
She blames me

212
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,440
because I'm not pregnant.

213
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,910
I didn't get pregnant this time,

214
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,120
but I will next time.

215
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:02,790
Let's go.

216
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,670
Go back to my room with me.

217
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,720
Don't stay here.

218
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Let's go!

219
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,110
Susu.

220
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,720
Calm down.

221
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,500
This isn't something to rush.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,150
We can't keep making the same mistake.

223
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,550
Young Master.

224
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,520
How is my sister-in-law?

225
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,360
Come in.

226
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,200
Xiaoqin.

227
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,050
Go get some food for her.

228
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,120
Yes.

229
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,130
Sister-in-law,

230
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,440
you haven't eaten anything all day.

231
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,770
Your body can't take it.

232
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,000
Every time I think of this,

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
I feel a stabbing pain in my ribs.

234
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,480
I can't eat.

235
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,130
Sister-in-law,

236
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,720
if you're feeling unwell,
you should see a doctor.

237
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,050
Don't just tough it out.

238
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,670
I'm fine.

239
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I know

240
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm just mad.

241
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,410
Sister-in-law,

242
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,910
Susu didn't mean it.

243
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,320
Please forgive her.

244
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,440
Do I need you to tell me that?

245
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,120
You can go now.

246
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,130
Sister-in-law,

247
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,200
well,

248
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,450
I'll head back to school then.

249
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,200
Back to school?

250
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,970
Why are you leaving?

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,080
There's a lot

252
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,990
I need to handle there.

253
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,020
Susu doesn't need me around anymore.

254
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
Go, then.

255
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,870
I know I can't make you stay.

256
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,560
Sister-in-law,

257
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,360
take care.

258
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,000
Susu,

259
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,310
I'm leaving soon,

260
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,730
going back to school
for some important matters.

261
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,910
I'll say it again:

262
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,630
what we had was wrong from the beginning.

263
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,360
You have a bright future ahead.

264
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,060
You need to make plans for yourself.

265
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,030
Qing.

266
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,510
Let's go.

267
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,320
Wendian.

268
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,200
Fei Wendian!

269
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,120
He just left.

270
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,030
He just left like that.

271
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,790
I knew Tietou wasn't
smart enough for this.

272
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,320
After a few drinks,

273
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,330
I got the whole story out of him.

274
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,240
Turns out Mrs. Fei was behind it all.

275
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,240
That woman is so calculating.

276
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,990
I told you
a mastermind was behind Tietou,

277
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,370
but I never thought it would be her.

278
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,270
Father,

279
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,670
we need to think this through.

280
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,690
Susu is still at her place after all.

281
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,910
Father.

282
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:27,980
Father.

283
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:28,870
Kejin.

284
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,120
Father.

285
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,840
I can't stay at the Fei Residence anymore.

286
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,170
I want to come back home.

287
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,900
Susu, sit down.

288
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,630
Well, speak of the devil.

289
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,980
You should be resting properly
for childbirth there

290
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,240
instead of coming back here all the time.

291
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm not pregnant.

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,550
What?

293
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,840
What's going on?

294
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,180
I don't know. I just...

295
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,390
I can't explain it all at once.

296
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,390
Anyway, Mrs. Fei

297
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,270
stopped talking to me
after she found out I wasn't pregnant.

298
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,030
The meals are barely edible!

299
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,360
I can't stay at the Fei Residence anymore!

300
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,000
What about Fei Wendian?

301
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,880
He's gone.

302
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,650
He's gone?

303
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,589
What did I say?

304
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,960
She tricked me

305
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,670
and bullied your sister.

306
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,750
I'll stand up for you.

307
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,589
This time,

308
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,109
we'll settle all scores with Widow Fei,

309
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,349
both old and new!

310
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,050
Dajiao.

311
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,960
You're leaving again?

312
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,920
Yeah.

313
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,800
It's a time of unrest.

314
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,240
I've got to make some money
while I still can.

315
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,560
If one day I can't go out,

316
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,110
the whole village will run out of salt.

317
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,110
The burden on my shoulders is heavy.

318
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,070
You brought back a lot of goods this time.

319
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,870
I spent months collecting them.

320
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,270
This time,

321
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,510
I'm going on a long journey.

322
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,400
It'll take over 10 days, right?

323
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,390
About half a month.

324
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,640
Press gangs! Press gangs!

325
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,280
Stay there! Don't run!

326
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,590
Don't run!

327
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,200
Run!

328
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,480
Dajiao, run! It's the press gangs!

329
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,920
Nobody move! Hurry up!

330
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,110
Where are you running? Are you stupid?

331
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,640
Hurry up!

332
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,440
All of you, stop running!

333
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,000
Stop there!

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,440
All you young men…

335
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,030
Hurry up!

336
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,110
Play dumb and deaf.

337
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,920
Sign up now!

338
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,920
You can eat well, drink well,

339
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,240
and…

340
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,550
and get military pay.

341
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,650
Give it to me.

342
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,120
People of Ox Temple Village, listen up!

343
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,050
All able-bodied young men

344
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,920
should go to the village entrance
to sign up right now.

345
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,580
Wages will be paid on the spot.

346
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,450
If anyone tries to escape,

347
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,380
his whole family will be punished!

348
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,600
Your village chief failed to do his job.

349
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,110
We required one man from each household,

350
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,270
and he came up short.

351
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,240
Soon,

352
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I'll take him back for questioning.

353
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,310
Take him away.

354
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,000
Move! Don't run, or I'll shoot you!

355
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,620
Get up! Move!

356
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,590
Move!

357
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,000
You!

358
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,560
Come here!

359
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,780
How old are you?

360
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,360
I-I'm just 15.

361
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,830
It's true. He just turned 15.

362
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,190
Get lost!

363
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,110
You two!

364
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,110
Don't move!

365
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,030
You,

366
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,240
turn around.

367
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,890
Turn around!

368
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,920
He's disabled.

369
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,350
A hunchback.

370
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,680
He's had this condition since childhood.

371
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,610
Even sleeping on a door panel
didn't fix it.

372
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,240
He can't farm or carry a gun.

373
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,860
He can only do small business.

374
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
A hunchback?

375
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Let me see.

376
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,240
You really are a hunchback.

377
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,480
You.

378
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,300
I'm talking to you.

379
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,580
This is my brother.

380
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,310
He's deaf and dumb. Even if…

381
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,800
a cannon fired next to his ear,

382
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,850
he wouldn't hear it.

383
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,230
A deaf man?

384
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,830
Yes.

385
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,290
He's his legs,

386
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,070
and he's his ears and mouth.

387
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
They work together to make a living.

388
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,290
He really is deaf.

389
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,200
Truly deaf and dumb.

390
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,190
Let's go!

391
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,120
Run! Run!

392
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,700
What are you doing?

393
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,370
Are you really deaf?

394
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,310
Run!

395
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,510
I-I can hear you!

396
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,750
Oh, no.

397
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,450
You can't go back now.

398
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,610
Now I see.

399
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,200
Heaven sent me here today to help you.

400
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,590
Listen,

401
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,440
Dajiao,

402
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,810
I don't mind taking you along.

403
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,480
Come with me for half a month.

404
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,570
I know what kind of man you are—

405
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,130
you don't cause trouble,

406
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,200
and you're a good helper.

407
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,260
After half a month,

408
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,560
you'll get some cash.

409
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,480
How about that?

410
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,440
That won't work.

411
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,470
My parents and Xiuxiu

412
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,640
will worry if they can't find me.

413
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,550
Are you afraid you'll miss your wife

414
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,880
or afraid to leave home?

415
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,200
If you really were a weak man,

416
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,350
your wife wouldn't have married you.

417
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,550
Don't look down on me.

418
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,410
I'm not afraid of leaving home.

419
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,360
I just don't want them to worry about me.

420
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,550
When we were together just now,

421
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,800
your second uncle saw us.

422
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,000
He'll definitely tell Xiuxiu about it.

423
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,910
If it's really a problem,
we'll head into town

424
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,160
and have someone send a message for you.

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,730
Stop hesitating.
You'll be caught if you go back!

426
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,800
Come on, let's go. Hurry!

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,060
What's happening?

428
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,110
W-What's going on?

429
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,400
Nothing.

430
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,030
-Auntie.
-Hurry up!

431
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,590
Auntie, what's happening?

432
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,400
Those soldiers are crazy.

433
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,530
They're taking any young man they see.

434
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,920
Zhuzi, Zhuzi!

435
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,070
Take this.

436
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:33,830
I don't need it.

437
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,550
Be careful.

438
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,200
Tietou.

439
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,330
Xiuxiu.

440
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,530
Have you seen Dajiao?

441
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,550
No. When did he leave?

442
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,440
He went to the fields early this morning.

443
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,830
There's nobody in the fields now.

444
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,240
They said press gangs came from the west,

445
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,110
taking every man they saw.

446
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,400
We can only go to the back mountain.

447
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
There are press gangs there too.

448
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,640
Let's head east of the village.

449
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:49,950
Okay.

450
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,480
Let's go.

451
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,480
Xiuxiu,

452
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,090
where are you going to look for Dajiao?

453
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm going to find Kejin

454
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,460
to get some militia men to help me search.

455
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,170
Let's go.

456
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,250
Tietou.

457
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,350
What?

458
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,150
That's right.

459
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,010
The recruiters don't take militia men.

460
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,310
Let's go.

461
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,270
Kejin!

462
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,180
Kejin!

463
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,920
Xiuxiu.

464
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,320
Kejin.

465
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,520
Why are you here?

466
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
The press gangs

467
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
are taking young men.

468
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,440
I can't find Dajiao anywhere.

469
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
Can you get some men
to help me look for him?

470
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,540
Don't panic.

471
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,490
My men can't go out now either.

472
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,350
I've already pulled everyone
off the fortress.

473
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,350
How about this?

474
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,310
Once they are gone,

475
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,070
I'll send men to find him.

476
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,240
That will be too late.

477
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,570
I caught these two
climbing over the wall.

478
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,750
What are you doing?
We're all from this village.

479
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,400
We all know each other.

480
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,720
Kejin, Kejin, look.

481
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,660
Enough. Let them go!

482
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,580
Let go of me!

483
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,160
Kejin,

484
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,110
well,

485
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,590
you gotta help us out.

486
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,550
Let us hide here.

487
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,590
How can I help?

488
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,680
Where can you hide?

489
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,350
Just look around.

490
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,080
Where could you possibly hide?

491
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,680
Don't worry about that.

492
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,410
I'll hide there.

493
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,920
What are you doing here?

494
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,690
When did you sneak in here?

495
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,590
Didn't anyone notice this boy

496
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,440
hiding here?

497
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,030
What good are you?

498
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,400
Close the door!

499
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,110
Besides,

500
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,640
why are you all hiding here?

501
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,290
I don't have any magic tricks to hide you.

502
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,340
What if those soldiers decide

503
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,660
to come into this courtyard?

504
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,240
Not only will you get caught,

505
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,310
but all my boys will be implicated too.

506
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,240
Hurry. Go back where you came from!

507
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,200
We have no choice, do we?

508
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,160
If it weren't for the press gangs,

509
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,090
we wouldn't set foot in your place.

510
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,240
Just looking at you annoys me.

511
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,160
Back then, I thought you were strong

512
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,720
and asked you to join the militia,

513
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,790
but you wouldn't, no matter what I said.

514
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,200
What?

515
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,960
My militia
doesn't look so worthless now, huh?

516
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,560
Aren't you Director Tietou?

517
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,270
You're the director.
What are you afraid of?

518
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,240
Who would dare take you?

519
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,350
C-Cut the crap!

520
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,050
We just need to hide here for now.

521
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,960
Yes or no?

522
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,590
No!

523
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,160
Get up!

524
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,230
It hurts!

525
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,550
You're still wet behind the ears.

526
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,110
Who would want you?

527
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,590
It hurts.

528
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,070
The officers wouldn't take you
even if you volunteered.

529
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,830
They say they can't fill the quota,

530
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,490
so they'll take children too.

531
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,070
It hurts.

532
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,590
What a chaotic world.

533
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,240
I can't help you.

534
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,680
Go back where you came from.

535
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,070
Move, move!

536
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,680
Kejin,

537
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,720
please help them.

538
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,070
Where else can they hide?

539
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,310
Xiuxiu, I can't help them.

540
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,790
All my men here

541
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,120
have already been registered.

542
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,680
Names matched to faces.

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,030
Report: no one here.

544
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,830
No one?

545
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,960
Report: no one here.

546
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,480
No one?

547
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,030
No.

548
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,010
Come. Let's go check that house.

549
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,240
Besides, when the soldiers come,

550
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,440
they don't take men here

551
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,240
because Father and I paid them off.

552
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,550
So stay out of this.

553
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,000
Xiu.

554
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,640
Open up!

555
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,510
Open up!

556
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,240
Open up!

557
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Coming, coming.

558
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,110
Officer.

559
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,000
You're here.

560
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,490
Please come in.

561
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,370
Everyone, stop training.

562
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,100
The officer is here. Greet him.

563
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,640
Good morning, Officer.

564
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,550
Officer,

565
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,020
are you thirsty?

566
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,400
I'll get you some tea.

567
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,250
Come here, Officer.

568
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,080
Officer,

569
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
have some tea.

570
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,310
What's wrong?

571
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,440
What's wrong?

572
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,770
What kind of tea is this?

573
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,390
I'll get you some good tea.

574
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Xiu!

575
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,830
Bring some good tea for the officer.

576
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,030
Coming, Officer.

577
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
There's the good tea.

578
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,590
Hurry, hurry.

579
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,510
Officer.

580
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,330
Let me pour you some tea.

581
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,030
This is my sister,

582
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,040
my own sister.

583
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,500
She's here to help out.

584
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,330
All right, nothing else.

585
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,060
Head back in.

586
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,230
Officer,

587
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,590
have some tea.

588
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,070
Sure.

589
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,900
Have a seat.

590
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
Your militia here

591
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,460
was formed
to protect the village from bandits

592
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,270
and doesn't participate in recruitment,

593
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,960
but this time, the higher-ups

594
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,860
have made a requirement
for all militia groups,

595
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,110
which is that the headcount here

596
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,880
must match exactly
with the number on the register.

597
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,110
We can't have

598
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,440
anyone sneaking in or switching places.

599
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,310
We wouldn't dare, Officer.

600
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,750
I've called back all the men
from the fortress.

601
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,710
All these men are listed on the register.

602
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,900
Every name matches,

603
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,180
all on the register.

604
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,880
They're all here?

605
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,310
Everyone's here, Officer.

606
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,880
Officer.

607
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,620
Take this for some drinks.

608
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,440
They're all here, huh?

609
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,510
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,680
Hurry.

611
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,440
Bid the officer farewell.

612
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,680
Farewell, Officer.

613
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,030
The tea is quite good!

614
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,720
I'll save this tea for you

615
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,920
for your next visit.

616
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,720
Okay.

617
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,830
See the officer out.

618
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,440
This way.

619
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,880
Farewell, Officer.

620
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,310
How old are you?

621
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,030
18.

622
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,680
This boy is 18.

623
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,480
He looks younger than his age,

624
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,680
but he's very strong.

625
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:54,660
Officer,

626
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,820
these two are older.

627
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,240
Look at me.
I almost forgot something important.

628
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,750
My superior

629
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,270
gave me a task.

630
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,750
He said when I came here,

631
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,220
I should take attendance first

632
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,220
and then make a copy of the register.

633
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,680
The tea you served me

634
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,810
made me forget this important matter.

635
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,490
Alright.

636
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,900
Go get the register.

637
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,440
Go.

638
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,220
Bring me the register.

639
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
Oh, Officer,

640
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
speaking of the register,

641
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,510
I can't…

642
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,240
I can't remember where I put it.

643
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,310
Once I find it,

644
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,640
I'll have someone deliver it to you, okay?

645
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,450
You're stalling, aren't you?

646
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,290
I'm not.

647
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,070
Officer,

648
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,400
all the men are here.

649
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,000
Let them call their own names,

650
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,310
and I'll write them down for you.

651
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,660
You can just take it back with you.

652
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,060
Get me the writing tools.

653
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,970
I'm on it.

654
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,070
How many men do you have here?

655
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,680
18.

656
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,550
How many?

657
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,270
No, no.

658
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,750
21.

659
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
21.

660
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,210
What's taking you so long?

661
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,280
Hurry.

662
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,160
Here, Officer,

663
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,320
the writing tools.

664
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,350
Fei Wu, start with you.

665
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,310
I'll record it.

666
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,030
Hurry!

667
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
My name is Fei Wu.

668
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,050
My name is Ma Dashan.

669
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,200
Stop, stop!

670
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,300
What are you doing?

671
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,010
Are you taking me for a fool?

672
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,310
If you had 10 men here,

673
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,810
and now there are 11,

674
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,270
don't you think

675
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,680
there might be deserters

676
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm looking for among them?

677
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,270
After you're done writing,

678
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,000
you'll save the men you want to save,

679
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,910
but I'll go back
without completing my mission

680
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,780
and face military punishment!

681
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,530
Fei Wu,

682
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,420
get over here!

683
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,270
Boss.

684
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,510
You shouldn't be called Fei Wu.

685
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,940
You should be called Loser!

686
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,500
I told you to keep that register safe.

687
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,320
Now it's nowhere

688
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,460
to be found.

689
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,590
Go find it!

690
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,680
Go!

691
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,680
X-Xiuxiu.

692
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,160
Fei Wu!

693
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,790
Have you found it?

694
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,510
Yes!

695
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,830
Boss.

696
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,590
Let me see it.

697
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:18,960
Is this it?

698
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,680
Look.

699
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,190
He found it. Here it is.

700
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,590
Huang Yinhe.

701
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,640
Present.

702
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,210
Ning Yousheng.

703
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:31,800
Present.

704
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,170
Wang Jianshan.

705
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,930
Present.

706
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,240
Xu Xiucai.

707
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,920
Here.

708
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,140
You're called Xiucai?

709
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,080
Can you read?

710
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,260
No. My mom said

711
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,200
if my name had the word "wealth" in it,
I'd get rich.

712
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,640
So have you gotten rich?

713
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,430
Officer,

714
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,000
as you can see, I'm so poor

715
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,880
that these clothes are all I have.

716
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,140
I haven't gotten rich,

717
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,840
not at all.

718
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,400
Wang Zhu.

719
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,550
Zhuzi.

720
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,510
Wang Zhu!

721
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,070
Zhuzi.

722
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm here!

723
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,960
I'm here.

724
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,510
Wan Yier!

725
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,470
Wan Yier!

726
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,600
-Yes.
-Yes.

727
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,550
You two,

728
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,890
which one of you is Wan Yier?

729
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,810
He's Wan Yier.

730
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,110
I'm Wan Yier.

731
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,750
And you?

732
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,750
I...

733
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm...

734
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,710
I-I'm called Niwei.

735
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,010
I knew something fishy was going on!

736
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,450
This last one's name is Li San.

737
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,450
You fool.

738
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,930
Isn't Niwei your nickname?

739
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Why did you give your nickname?

740
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,990
The officer is asking for your full name.

741
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,190
You should say Li San.

742
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,240
Right.

743
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,960
Right.

744
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm the third son

745
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,920
of the Li family.

746
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,270
I'm called Li San.

747
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,560
My nickname is Niwei.

748
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,830
My eldest brother is called Meiwei,

749
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,640
a-and my second brother is called Chouwei.

750
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,640
You're just

751
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,440
as annoying as your name.

752
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,680
Officer, that's right.

753
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,270
He really is annoying.

754
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,350
Annoying!

755
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,920
Truly annoying.

756
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,150
Alright.

757
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,310
Let's leave it at that.

758
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,720
Okay.

759
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,530
See you.

760
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,790
See you, Officer. Take care.

761
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,250
Fall in!

762
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,730
Bid the officer farewell.

763
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,400
Farewell, Officer.

764
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,030
Kejin,

765
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
you were amazing.

766
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,840
You insisted on helping the three of them.

767
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,790
In just this short time,

768
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,390
I spent five silver dollars.

769
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,530
Sit down.

770
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,410
Take a rest.

771
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,770
You wrote this, didn't you?

772
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,000
Xiuxiu,

773
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,030
why didn't you write my name Tietou?

774
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,140
Why call me Wan Yier?

775
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,540
I almost didn't catch on.

776
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,560
The names of the three of you

777
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,800
all contain complicated characters.

778
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,139
I just had a short time,

779
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,620
so I wrote simple names.

780
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,190
My sister is so clever

781
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,110
and came up with this plan
to save you three.

782
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,030
Thank her now.

783
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,340
-Thank you, Xiuxiu.
-Thank you, Xiuxiu.

784
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,150
Thank you, Xiu.

785
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,550
Kejin,

786
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,679
let's go look for Dajiao.

787
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,610
Oh, right.

788
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,580
Our names are on this register now.

789
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,110
We can help look for him too.

790
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,670
Let's go now.

791
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,100
Dajiao!

792
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,480
Dajiao!

793
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,550
Dajiao!

794
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,280
Dajiao!

795
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,400
Dajiao!

796
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,800
-Dajiao!
-Dajiao!

797
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,260
Xiuxiu.

798
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,760
Searching like this isn't working.

799
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,400
Let's do this:

800
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,110
you and Zhuzi go search the fields,

801
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,920
and I'll go with Niwei

802
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,190
to search the mountains.

803
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,590
Hurry!

804
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,840
Dajiao!

805
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,670
Dajiao!

806
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,670
Dajiao!

807
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,760
Dajiao!

808
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,480
Dajiao!

809
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,030
Isn't that Dajiao's hoe?

810
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,360
Xiu.

811
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,310
This is Dajiao's hoe.

812
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,230
It…

813
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,800
It is.

814
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,680
He'd never leave his hoe behind.

815
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,320
Could something bad have happened to him?

816
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,110
Dajiao.

817
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
Dajiao.

818
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,670
Bros, have you seen Dajiao?

819
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,630
No, no.

820
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,230
No, no.

821
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,230
Dajiao!

822
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,110
Dajiao!

823
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,360
Guiyao.

824
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,740
Help me send a message home.

825
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,120
What message?

826
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,630
I'm just joking.

827
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,380
When I bought the goods just now,
I got it done.

828
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,510
You've really sent a message for me?

829
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,760
What? You don't trust me?

830
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,440
No, no, no.

831
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,650
I'm just afraid they'll worry too much.

832
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,170
They, huh?

833
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,220
Just say Xiuxiu directly.

834
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,730
Everyone in the village knows

835
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,160
how much you cherish your wife.

836
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,230
Xiu,

837
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,670
I looked for Dajiao with your father today

838
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,870
and heard something.

839
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,360
It's about Dajiao?

840
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Don't worry. It's not about Dajiao.

841
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,630
Everyone in the village is saying

842
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,400
that Susu's pregnancy was fake.

843
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,960
It's all over the village now.

844
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,280
They say that Young Master Fei left
after he found out,

845
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,570
and then Susu went back to her father.

846
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,550
Oh my,

847
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,590
one thing after another.

848
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,750
Like they say,

849
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,030
when it rains, it pours.

850
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,400
You really have it hard.

851
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,440
Where do you think Dajiao could have gone?

852
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,630
If he can't send a message back,

853
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,590
at least send me a dream.

854
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,030
Mother.

855
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,740
Opps.

856
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,350
Only d-dead people

857
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,540
send dreams.

858
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,690
I'm just so worried.

859
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,930
Alright. I'm going back to my room.

860
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,300
Get some sleep.

861
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,030
Did you find him?

862
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,920
No.

863
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,940
I've looked everywhere
but couldn't find him.

864
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,710
Haven't you heard?

865
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,340
The press gangs

866
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,070
were like mad dogs.

867
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,760
They took anyone they saw.

868
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,070
If you can lift a gun, you're taken.

869
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,800
They even took Xuerui away.

870
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,800
Maybe

871
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,230
Dajiao

872
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,880
has been taken too.

873
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,320
How could this happen?

874
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,230
We're in such terrible times.

875
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,920
Don't worry. Dajiao is blessed.

876
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,000
He has Grandpa Ox watching over him.

877
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,440
Dajiao.

878
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,580
My Dajiao.

879
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,670
Madam.

880
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,030
Mr. Ning.

881
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,320
What are you playing at?

882
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,040
I'm not playing at anything.

883
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,710
I don't beat around the bush either.

884
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,800
I just have one question for you.

885
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,920
What family rule of yours
did my daughter break

886
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,480
that you kicked her out?

887
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,770
What are you talking about?

888
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,360
I've been sick these past few days.

889
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,190
I had no idea Susu went back to you.

890
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,440
Even if she was neglected,

891
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,670
it was because I was ill.

892
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,050
That's hardly a serious offense.

893
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,070
All the neighbors are here.

894
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,880
They all know how I usually

895
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,290
treat Susu.

896
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,120
Susu should know that very well too.

897
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,430
Stop using illness as an excuse.

898
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,800
In my house,

899
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,140
my daughter was doted on

900
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,710
as the apple of my eye.

901
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,130
Yet in your house,
she's barely fed and cared for.

902
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,470
If you couldn't provide for her,

903
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,890
you should've said so openly.

904
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,920
Let all the villagers know about it.

905
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,320
If only things were like what you said.

906
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,840
Your daughter truly is
the apple of your eye.

907
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,710
Everyone knows

908
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,510
how Susu was married

909
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,190
into the Fei family.

910
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,580
It's common knowledge for miles around.

911
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,030
I have my own way

912
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,760
to handle my family affairs.

913
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,240
No one else has any right to interfere.

914
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,320
I also have my own way to rent my land.

915
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,530
Whether it's permanent tenancy
or whatever,

916
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,510
I won't let anyone blackmail me.

917
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,550
If you cross the line,

918
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,800
someone will put you in your place.

919
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,880
Now,

920
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,820
sort out your own family matters first.

921
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,030
Tell me,

922
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,260
my daughter suffered a lot.
What are you going to do?

923
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,270
What can I do?

924
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,280
She should get out of the carriage,
go back in,

925
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,610
and fulfill her duties.

926
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,000
If she fulfills her duties,

927
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,190
the Fei family

928
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,390
will certainly not mistreat her.

929
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,110
Xiaoqin.

930
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,320
Help Young Mistress out of the carriage.

931
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,800
Yes.

932
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,380
Young Mistress, please come down.

933
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Don't get out until this is settled.

934
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,760
Mr. Ning,

935
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,110
you failed your duty

936
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,270
with the permanent tenancy.

937
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,070
You don't get to settle the score with me.

938
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,870
Because it was

939
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,530
not my fault to start with.

940
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,400
If you hadn't provoked Tietou,

941
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,800
I wouldn't have lost this round.

942
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,760
If you don't make up for my loss,

943
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,850
I won't let you off.

944
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,290
How should I make it up?

945
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,440
I have an idea.

946
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,360
After everything that's happened,

947
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,290
you should give Susu five mu of land

948
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,140
as a good gesture

949
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,720
to welcome her back to the Fei Residence.

950
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,360
I must say, your daughter is

951
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,840
quite precious indeed.

952
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,330
One trip home
could earn her five mu of land.

953
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,620
The hundreds of mu of land
left by your ancestors

954
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,480
were all acquired in the same way?

955
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,130
Take

956
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,720
your daughter home.

957
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,510
Xiaoqin, let's head back in.

958
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,000
Yes.

959
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,230
Susu.

960
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,440
Xiuxiu.

961
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,360
Susu,

962
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,400
Xiuxiu.

963
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,440
Come with me.

964
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,290
Careful.

965
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,320
You're just arguing
for your own interests.

966
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,450
Aren't you ashamed?

967
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,850
Has anyone considered
my sister's feelings?

968
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,250
And you call yourselves heads of families.

969
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,240
You don't need to push her to each other.

970
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,500
She's leaving with me.

971
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,380
Let's go.

972
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,710
I'm going back in.

973
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,590
Mrs. Fei.

974
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:01,400
Close the door.

975
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,360
We're not finished here.
