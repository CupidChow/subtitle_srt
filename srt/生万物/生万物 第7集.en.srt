[Episode 7]

3
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,950
Susu.

4
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,110
Last night, did we...

5
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,520
Farewell, my homeland.

6
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,300
Farewell, my Xiuxiu.

7
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,829
Farewell, my forever lost love

8
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,670
and passion.

9
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,079
Susu.

10
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,090
Are you up?

11
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
What would you like to eat today?

12
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,820
I haven't decided yet.

13
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,290
Take your time.

14
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,370
Just let the cook know it

15
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,930
and they'll make it for you.

16
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,459
I need to go collect rents
with Steward Liu today

17
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,470
and won't be back until late.

18
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
Did Wendian say anything

19
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,950
when he left?

20
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:38,940
It's okay.

21
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
Don't worry about it.

22
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
If you need anything,
just tell me.

23
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,520
Let me do your hair.

24
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,750
You can't do it yourself anymore,
can you?

25
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,450
I can't do mine either.

26
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,740
Xiaoqin usually does it for me.

27
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,570
Sister-in-law, my hair looks awful.

28
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,290
I want to have it in braids,
which are simple.

29
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,670
Susu, you can't have braids anymore.

30
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,950
Looks good.

31
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,250
If you can learn more skills

32
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,900
to please your man,

33
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,270
that would be better.

34
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,430
I have to go now.

35
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,980
This hairstyle isn't as pretty
as when Xiuxiu does it.

36
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,040
It looks terrible.

37
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,480
How am I going to explain this to Xiuxiu?

38
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,200
Xiuxiu said

39
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,050
she wanted to come home to see me.

40
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,650
I heard this too from Lianye.

41
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,620
These words from her

42
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,330
are enough to satisfy me.

43
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,880
Mother, I know Xiu wants to see you.

44
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,580
I'll prepare the cart now
and take you to her.

45
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,270
We cannot go.

46
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,510
Why not?

47
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,480
Kejin.

48
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,090
Though your father has many flaws,

49
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,360
he is still your father,

50
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
the head of the Ning family.

51
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,100
Your sister is defying him

52
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,490
and if we also make trouble for him,

53
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,990
he'll lose all face in the village.

54
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,480
Then

55
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,430
he won't even be able to
speak confidently to peasant farmers.

56
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,390
Son,

57
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,900
whatever you do in the future,

58
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,800
you must consider
saving your father's face.

59
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,900
It's not just about his pride.

60
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,550
It's about the reputation and honor
of our entire Ning family.

61
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,390
Mother.

62
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,830
Father was so cruel

63
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,510
to my two sisters,

64
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,620
yet you still care about him.

65
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,830
Son,

66
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,580
isn't your mother like a millstone?

67
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,040
I must protect everyone in our family,

68
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,330
protect our bodies and our dignity.

69
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
Only then can the Ning family

70
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,159
be worthy of being called

71
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,700
the great family with over 700 mu
of land in this region.

72
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,580
You're right.

73
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll do as you say.

74
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,600
Although the villagers have complaints

75
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,920
about my father,

76
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,040
when they speak of you, Mother,

77
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,920
everyone will give you a thumbs up.

78
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,870
Son,

79
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,510
I called you here

80
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,870
because there's an urgent matter
I need you to handle.

81
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,480
Go ahead.

82
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,190
What's up, Fei Wu?

83
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,420
Looking for me?

84
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,440
Dajiao.

85
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,530
My mother wants to see you.

86
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,159
Mother.

87
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,900
Dajiao is here.

88
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,440
Dajiao.

89
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,200
Come in.

90
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,200
Sit down.

91
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,360
Dajiao.

92
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,570
Have a seat.

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,670
How

94
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,630
are you feeling now?

95
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,300
I'm

96
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,670
fine.

97
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,100
Dajiao.

98
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,050
You've had a hard time these days.

99
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,110
Not at all.

100
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,750
I know

101
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,910
your father forced you to accept Xiuxiu

102
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,670
to get more dowry.

103
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,150
I'm sorry about that.

104
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,030
That's not true.

105
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,660
He didn't force me.

106
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,240
Dajiao.

107
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,500
I asked you to come today

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
because I want to talk to you.

109
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,390
After all,

110
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
you're now a son-in-law
of the Ning family,

111
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,200
but we haven't really talked before.

112
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
We have.

113
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,200
When?

114
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,770
I'm too old to recall it.

115
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
That autumn,

116
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,460
right after the sunflower harvest,

117
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,910
Xiuxiu and I,
along with some other children,

118
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,240
were playing in the yard

119
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,910
among the sunflower heads.

120
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,450
You called Xiuxiu home for supper
in the doorway,

121
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,240
and gave me two steamed buns,

122
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,150
thanking me

123
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,970
for always carrying Xiuxiu on my back.

124
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,700
You also said

125
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,470
she would go out to play after eating.

126
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,290
I remember everything.

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
Those buns you gave me

128
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,920
were very delicious.

129
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,550
Dajiao.

130
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,630
About the dowry,

131
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,400
Xiuxiu said she didn't want it.

132
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,590
I am thinking

133
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
that eventually,

134
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,220
I should let you take it back.

135
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,750
If you called me here for this reason,

136
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,750
then I must leave.

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,150
I absolutely cannot take it back.

138
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,550
X-X-Xiuxiu will be angry
if she knows this.

139
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,370
Alright,

140
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,850
let's not about it.

141
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,330
Come,

142
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,550
sit down.

143
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,270
Auntie,

144
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,560
let me be honest with you.

145
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,110
My father has his thoughts.

146
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,400
I keep Xiuxiu with me

147
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,930
not because I want anything from her.

148
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,270
Dajiao,

149
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,600
I asked you to come today

150
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,700
because I wanted to tell you a few things.

151
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,130
Please go ahead.

152
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,190
Do you love Xiuxiu?

153
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I knew it.

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,520
My Xiuxiu didn't choose blindly.

155
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,100
This room.

156
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,240
is where

157
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,510
Xiuxiu grew up.

158
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,550
That day,

159
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
she and the matchmaker

160
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,720
walked out of this very room.

161
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,360
When she left this room,

162
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,240
she truly knew

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,960
you must be a good man.

164
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,120
Actually,

165
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,670
as her mother,

166
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,610
I shouldn't bring this up,

167
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,910
but I must say it now.

168
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,410
My daughter has endured many hardships.

169
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,680
I believe you already know about them.

170
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,390
I just want to tell you

171
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,770
that from now on,

172
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
you must treat her well.

173
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,080
I...

174
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,410
I will definitely treat her well.

175
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,720
You can rest assured.

176
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,240
Then I, as her mother,

177
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,870
should bow to you in respect.

178
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,790
Please don't.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,640
-I can’t take it.
-Thank you.

180
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,840
Thank you for accepting her.

181
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
If one day,

182
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,900
you find her unsuitable
because of her past,

183
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,160
and don't want her anymore,

184
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
just send her back to me.

185
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,500
Don't let her remarry.

186
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,960
Just bring her back to me.

187
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,240
If I'm no longer alive by then,

188
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,710
you,

189
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,900
just take her to my burial mound.

190
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,790
Let her cry aloud

191
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
at my grave.

192
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,480
It'll be like I'm holding her,

193
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,950
comforting her.

194
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,550
Auntie.

195
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,650
Let's not talk about this anymore.

196
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,840
I swear

197
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
I will never,

198
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,280
ever dislike Xiuxiu.

199
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,170
As long as she's willing

200
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,270
to live a hard life with me,

201
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,720
I promise

202
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,010
I'll be good to her forever.

203
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,510
My Xiuxiu

204
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,440
would never mind

205
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,200
living a hard life with you.

206
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,980
My daughter Xiuxiu is capable of

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,200
making the best of the worst situation.

208
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,500
I feel relieved to hear

209
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,270
what you've said.

210
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,840
Don't tell her about your visit today.

211
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,230
She's sensitive.

212
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,130
She misses her mother,

213
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,110
and it would break her heart.

214
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,150
We can't hurt her anymore.

215
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,030
Xiuxiu has already had

216
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,870
too much heartbreak in her life.

217
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,470
We won't make her sad.

218
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,910
My poor Xiuxiu.

219
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,830
Mother.

220
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,000
Mother.

221
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,870
You said you wouldn't cry.

222
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,700
Why are you crying again, Mother?

223
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,390
Mother, stop crying, okay?

224
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,710
No more tears.

225
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,700
Kejin,

226
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,480
please send your brother-in-law home.

227
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,210
Then carry me back to the house.

228
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,020
Alright.

229
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Let's go, Dajiao.

230
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,550
Dajiao.

231
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,200
Bye.

232
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,950
Mother.

233
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,330
Please take care.

234
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,120
Xiu.

235
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,330
I heard you say
you missed your mother this morning.

236
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,300
I am thinking

237
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,170
I could borrow a cart tomorrow

238
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,520
to bring Mother here. What do you think?

239
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,200
Bring Mother here?

240
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,900
Yeah, bring your mother over.

241
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,360
She'll keep you company,

242
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,150
and help ease your mind.

243
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,070
But she's still ill—

244
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,210
she might not be able to travel.

245
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,600
If she stays with us,

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,390
she might recover quicker.

247
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,200
Our place

248
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
may be a bit rundown,

249
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,110
but who'd care for her

250
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,790
better than you?

251
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,320
And I'll be here too.

252
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,080
Together, we'll do better than anyone.

253
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,750
You're right.

254
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,200
If only she could come…

255
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,120
I miss her so much.

256
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,030
Tomorrow, we'll clean up the house.

257
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,470
I'll prepare the cart to fetch her.

258
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
Get some rest.

259
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,640
You too.

260
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,200
Old man,

261
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,000
you're back.

262
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,840
Ugh...

263
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,730
Did I wake you again?

264
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,000
Old man...

265
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,670
come here.

266
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,960
Keep me company for a bit.

267
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,550
I've got something to tell you.

268
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,670
So...

269
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,800
You're not mad at me anymore?

270
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,520
Old Woman...

271
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,580
Y-you—you're finally talking to me again!

272
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,320
Considering we'll
be buried together someday,

273
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,080
I can't keep ignoring you.

274
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,069
Old man,

275
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,510
I've thought it through—

276
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,930
You didn't save Xiuxiu

277
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,329
because you couldn't bear
to lose the land.

278
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
That land is your lifeblood.

279
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,490
To you, it matters more than me,

280
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,819
more than our daughter,

281
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,800
more than anything in this world.

282
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,960
This is in your bones and flesh—

283
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,240
it can't be changed.

284
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,630
I don't blame you for that.

285
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,750
I don't blame you either

286
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,580
for letting Susu substitute Xiuxiu.

287
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,540
After all, the Fei family
is better off than others.

288
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,920
What I want to say is—

289
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,520
we're done meddling
in the children's affairs.

290
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,510
From now on,

291
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,160
let them find their own way.

292
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,840
I'll have Mrs. Li
make you porridge right away—

293
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,490
millet porridge with brown sugar,
together with boiled eggs…

294
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,510
Two eggs.

295
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,580
No, three eggs.

296
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,090
Didn't you always say,

297
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,550
after bearing three children,

298
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,950
you never got enough postpartum porridge?

299
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,500
This time, you'll have your fill.

300
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,030
Great.

301
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,880
That's great.

302
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,750
Old man...

303
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,200
This life's been so long,

304
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,950
so weary.

305
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,350
Tell me this—

306
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
when I die,

307
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,160
how thick a house will you give me?

308
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,530
Why talk about this?

309
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,290
You're not going to die.

310
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,390
Then make mine four inches thick.

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,960
Four inches.

312
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,510
Alright, four inches it is.

313
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,790
Old woman,

314
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,100
you slept peacefully last night—

315
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,580
not a single cough.

316
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,990
Rest a while longer.

317
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,070
I'm off to Kuangzi to collect debts.

318
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,490
My mother, Madam Ning of the Guo Clan,

319
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,050
passed away at dawn today!

320
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,900
Her grieving son, Ning Kejin,

321
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,280
announces her departure with sorrow.

322
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,130
Miss Xiuxiu,

323
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,980
please return at once
to keep vigil by Madam's bier.

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,530
What's the meaning of this?

325
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,790
There's only one for Xiuxiu—
nothing for Dajiao!

326
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,590
Is Dajiao even still their son-in-law?

327
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,010
How can you nitpick at a time like this?

328
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,070
Hurry up and get ready
to offer condolences!

329
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,890
Quit dawdling—move it!

330
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,200
And don't forget to hang the lanterns!

331
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,000
Brother,

332
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,440
I've been thinking—

333
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,590
how about hiring just one funeral band

334
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,750
and holding the funeral in three days?

335
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,530
Would that work?

336
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,140
Uncle.

337
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,410
we need to hire two funeral bands—

338
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,520
I won't have Mother leaving this house
until she's lain here seven full days.

339
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,120
Seven days?
How will you manage life with that?

340
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,470
You think a lavish funeral  is great?

341
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,220
You think your mother
would've wanted this?

342
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,590
Brother,

343
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,250
a modest funeral is fine,

344
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,120
but it should still be proper

345
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,230
to let my sister-in-law rest in peace.

346
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,130
Alright, alright.

347
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,000
You decide—

348
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,560
we'll do it your way.

349
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,940
Ren Guanxiu—
One bolt of blue mourning cloth.

350
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,600
Chen Jin—
One bolt of blue mourning cloth.

351
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,190
Chen Bi—One bundle of joss paper.

352
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,380
Zhao Dabao—One bundle of joss paper.

353
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,480
Yan Xueren—One bundle of joss paper.

354
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,480
Mourners, commence lamentation!

355
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,830
Mother...

356
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,920
Take incense and make offering!

357
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,400
Present the libation!

358
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,860
Look.

359
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,450
Your son-in-law has arrived.

360
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,770
Er.

361
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,600
Er!

362
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,240
If Ning Xuexiang accepts
this marriage alliance today,

363
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,030
you'll have your pick of fields to tend

364
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,400
from here on out!

365
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,380
Three more mourners.

366
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,390
He is...

367
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,300
What?

368
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,010
He's...

369
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,290
Take three condolence hats.

370
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,750
Wait...

371
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,090
Dajiao,

372
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,990
they don't treat you as a son-in-law.

373
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,530
I don't care.

374
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,050
See?

375
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,310
See that?

376
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,370
Our Dajiao's got spine!

377
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,200
Er,

378
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,610
you're family-by-marriage—

379
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,610
an honored guest!

380
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,160
You should sit at the head table!

381
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,020
Then as the uncle-in-law,
I too deserve that seat.

382
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,480
Yet here I'm cast aside like leftovers!

383
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,640
Are you really
head to the rotating banquet?

384
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,370
Let's feast!

385
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,160
Feast like it's famine tomorrow—

386
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,760
that tightwad Miser Ning will weep
when his larder's bare!

387
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,330
Eat!

388
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,220
The bereaved return gratitude!

389
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,090
It's your turn, Glutton Fei.

390
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,330
You guys go first.

391
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,860
What are you up to?

392
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,330
Hurry up!

393
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,230
Quit dawdling!

394
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,360
Yinzi, come on here.

395
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,690
Listen here—

396
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,680
go tell the master of the house:

397
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,310
We may have the kids wail at the funeral,

398
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,310
and they'll get steamed buns after.

399
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,410
Go now—quick, go!

400
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,150
That's why I say,

401
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,750
Glutton Fei's idea is sharp.

402
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,500
Glutton Fei's idea is sharp.

403
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,950
Let none mock another—

404
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,530
hunger speaks for itself.

405
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,380
Mark my words, we mean well.

406
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,550
Just watch:

407
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,960
the young master and mistress

408
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,880
will wail themselves hoarse

409
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
within two hours.

410
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,480
I'm just having children weep for them
fulfills filial duty.

411
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,640
Impressive.

412
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,000
Later, you'll need to
put on the mourning garments—

413
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,660
you hear me?

414
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,550
-Let's go home.
-What are you doing?

415
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,790
Still want those steamed buns or not?

416
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,200
Have you no decency left?

417
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,770
Let's go.

418
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,700
Come back here.

419
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,590
Wait!

420
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,760
Tietou.

421
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,900
Where do you think you're going?

422
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,360
We haven't even eaten at the banquet yet!

423
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,700
You think those kowtows were free?

424
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,760
Come! With me, now!

425
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,200
Mourners, commence lamentation!

426
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,810
Cry now!

427
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,910
Cry and you'll get steamed buns.

428
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,930
Master Ning,

429
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,480
Master Ning.

430
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,510
Please accept my deepest condolences.

431
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,590
Let's skip the formalities today—

432
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,650
what's the matter?

433
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,990
Just now I saw

434
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,510
there aren't enough mourners wailing.

435
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,310
I can bring my wife and son

436
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,710
to help wail the lament.

437
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,300
My boy's got strong lungs,

438
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,440
and so do I.

439
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,590
My wife and I

440
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,310
don't need your donkey-braying mourning.

441
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,190
The debt's due date stands—

442
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,840
when the time comes,
you'd better pay in cash.

443
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,070
If no cash,

444
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,640
pay in lands.

445
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,170
Crying here won't earn you anything—

446
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,920
not food, not drink.

447
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,300
Like your mother did,

448
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,850
go wail at the mourning tent.

449
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,850
Then I'll give your dad
a sack of dried sweet potatoes.

450
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,490
What a stubborn little girl!

451
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,600
So this is who you are, Xiuxiu?

452
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,330
you knew your mother longed for you,

453
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,480
yet you

454
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,770
dared to harden your heart and stay away?

455
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,470
Could you not grant her
one final farewell?

456
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,960
Yinzi.

457
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,310
Yinzi!

458
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,770
What happened to
that silver tongue of yours?

459
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,240
Go on—laugh at my father again!

460
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,040
It was my fault. I didn't mean it!

461
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,340
Yin-Yinzi!

462
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,880
Look, I brought you a steamed bun!
It's so good...

463
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,480
Yin-Yinzi!

464
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,480
Keep following me,

465
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,590
and I'll beat you dead—you hear me?

466
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,880
My tongue's wicked—I'll slap it right!

467
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,010
I'll beat it proper!

468
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,570
Yinzi!

469
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,240
Follow me again, and I'll jump from here!

470
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,030
No, please!

471
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,920
Go away!

472
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,430
Yin—

473
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,670
It's Dajiao. Dajiao is here.

474
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,260
Stop.

475
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,190
Rise.

476
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,310
Now this—this is a proper burial offering!

477
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,790
What a fine child!

478
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,310
Such respect!

479
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The bereaved return gratitude!

480
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,730
Keep it low.

481
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,490
Hey, isn't that Dajiao?

482
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,200
Dajiao's actually come!

483
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,590
Look at Dajiao,
playing the dutiful son-in-law!

484
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,550
This whole setup—

485
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,350
it's the full funeral rites

486
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,100
for a daughter and son-in-law!

487
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,960
Where'd you scrape this together?

488
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,110
How much did it bleed you?

489
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,310
Have you lost all sense?

490
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,040
Scraped together
from two funeral supply shops.

491
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,460
You little brat!

492
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,470
They never took him seriously
to begin with—

493
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,270
now he's doubling down
like he matters!

494
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,200
Er!

495
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,900
Let's go to the banquet!

496
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,980
I'm too furious to swallow a bite—
this rage fills me up!

497
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,940
Mourners, commence lamentation!

498
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,540
Take incense and make offering!

499
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,990
Present the libation!

500
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Prostrate in obeisance!

501
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,220
On behalf of Xiuxiu, I, Dajiao, am

502
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,680
kowtowing to you.

503
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,070
May you

504
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,400
find peace

505
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,000
beyond this world soon!

506
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,270
Mother...

507
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,530
Xiuxiu and her husband are
here to bid you farewell.

508
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,790
Mother...

509
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,680
Mother!

510
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,080
Please open your eyes.

511
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,440
Xiuxiu is here to see you off.

512
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,640
Mother.

513
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,720
Mother.

514
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,830
Mother.

515
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,110
What are you looking for?

516
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,070
Red paper.

517
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,510
Why do you need that now?

518
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,480
I promised my mother

519
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,200
I'd cut window flowers every New Year,

520
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,920
and bring them back to her.

521
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:11,810
I see.

522
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll get some for you.

523
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,510
Receive the casket.

524
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,790
Mother!

525
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,610
Rest in peace!

526
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,920
My wife, you're so blessed.

527
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,800
Look—

528
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,240
the whole village has come
to send you off.

529
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,870
Be careful.

530
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,480
Are we sending Xiuxiu's mother?

531
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,190
Yes, right.

532
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,880
There's spirit money inside. Take some

533
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,510
Take it.

534
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,070
Come on.

535
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,670
Just take it.

536
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,880
Take it from here.

537
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,250
Madam,

538
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,930
we've come to see you off.

539
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,950
Auntie. We've come to see you off.

540
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,670
Tietou's mother.

541
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,800
Sister-in-law.

542
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,720
Why aren't you with the relatives?

543
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,560
That doesn't matter.

544
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,980
The old man's fuming inside.

545
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,030
Let's give Xiuxiu's mother
a proper send-off.

546
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,040
Does it matter which way we go?

547
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,590
Old ladies, yong ladies,

548
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,460
and young boys should all stay.

549
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,260
Mother!

550
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,320
Mother!

551
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,810
Mother!

552
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,440
[Spirit Tablet of the Late Lady Guo
of the Gu Family]

553
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,970
Mother!

554
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,760
Mother!

555
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,260
Stop.

556
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,620
Mother!

557
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:22,780
Mother!

558
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,110
Mother...

559
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,510
Mother.

560
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,420
Your unfilial daughter
has come to see you, Mother.

561
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,890
Mother.

562
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,100
Mother... won't you open your eyes for me?

563
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,730
Mother.

564
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,360
Mother... won't you open your eyes for me?

565
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,880
Mother...

566
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,230
Mother!

567
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,880
Mother...

568
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,800
Mother.

569
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,630
Your Xiuxiu has come to see you...

570
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,160
I didn't even get to see you
one last time.

571
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,210
My Xiuxiu...

572
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,110
It's my uselessness

573
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,800
that made you suffer so.

574
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,480
Even in death, I can't close my eyes

575
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,140
thinking of what you endured.

576
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,190
Mother.

577
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,920
I wasn't... defiled by those bandits.

578
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,100
I escaped unharmed.

579
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,470
I only said those things...

580
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,120
to spite Father.

581
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,260
Mother... can you ever forgive me?

582
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,190
Mother.

583
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,980
Xiuxiu.

584
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,180
Xiuxiu, that's enough now.

585
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,320
Don't cry anymore, Xiuxiu.

586
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,250
Come here, Xiuxiu.

587
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,210
-Xiuxiu.
-Mother.

588
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:51,540
Mother!

589
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,760
Mother! Don't go, Mother!

590
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,890
Come on here, Xiuxiu.

591
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,440
-Raise the casket.
-Don't go!

592
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,800
Xiuxiu, come here.

593
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,940
Mother is gone.

594
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,560
Susu stayed with the Fei family—

595
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,360
that home once filled with laughter,

596
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,960
now...

597
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,400
holds nothing left

598
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,840
to tie me there.

599
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,020
On Mother's seventh-day memorial,

600
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,980
Susu returned to see Father.

601
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,590
She told him of Dajiao's hardships,

602
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,520
begged him

603
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,530
to help me.

604
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,460
Father said,

605
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,410
if I cross this threshold
and acknowledge him as my father again,

606
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,350
he'll agree.

607
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,970
Hit harder. Mind your hands.

608
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,510
You made it!

609
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,330
You're such a quick learner.

610
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,210
Good girl.

611
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,070
This isn't as good as
what you have at home—

612
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,360
those foreign fire-makers (matches).

613
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,280
I'll make Ning Xuexiang see—

614
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,250
even without the Ning family,

615
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,230
I can thrive on my own.

616
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,960
I'll build a life

617
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,560
bright as blooming flowers,

618
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,840
and outshine him at every turn.

619
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,740
The heavens are truly ingenious—

620
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,470
who first discovered

621
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,890
that striking these together

622
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,710
brings forth fire?

623
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,150
Those foreign matches? Useless.

624
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,150
Just a lazy man's shortcut.

625
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,380
I've smoked my whole life—

626
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,550
always trusted this method.

627
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,250
Alright, alright—

628
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,600
stop fussing with it.

629
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,000
The fire's fine,

630
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,230
just wasteful with wood.

631
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,290
Well then...

632
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,620
how do we save firewood?

633
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,670
Teach me please—I'm ready to learn.

634
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,850
Let me teach you.

635
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,220
Bring that firewood here.

636
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,280
Mother.

637
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,360
Dajiao—

638
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,720
knew you'd be back soon.

639
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,070
Come and eat.

640
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,690
Coming. I'm starving.

641
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,340
Old Man,

642
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,920
dinner's ready.

643
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,110
Let's eat first, Father. Stop calculating.
