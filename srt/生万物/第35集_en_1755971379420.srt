00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,910
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,950
Here,

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,590
the goat milk.

5
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,479
Mother, take it slow.

6
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,340
She drank the milk!

7
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,850
She's drinking it.

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,770
Xiu,

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,880
you finally spoke.

10
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,900
I want to thank you all

11
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,590
on behalf of Susu.

12
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,570
Thank you, Mother.

13
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,800
She's drinking now. So don't cry.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,660
Look how happily she's drinking!

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,240
Great. Look, good girl.

16
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,310
-Look.
-She's drinking.

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,910
Let's give our little girl a name.

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,590
I think,

19
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,720
since the little girl drinks goat milk,

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,980
let's call her Yangya.

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,820
Yangya.

22
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,380
Yangya sounds good.

23
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,470
It rolls off the tongue nicely. Yangya.

24
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,530
From now on, your name will be Yangya.

25
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,150
Yangya drinks goat milk.

26
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,890
Look how hungry

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,010
she is.

28
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,930
Look at her drinking.

29
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,610
Look.

30
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,329
I heard from Chang Chun

31
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,970
that the Japanese had big ambitions.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,190
Their battle lines were stretched far,

33
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,190
with them getting more aggressive.

34
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,850
But our anti-Japanese forces

35
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,830
took advantage
of the shift of their main troops

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,690
to launch local counterattacks.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,430
The news of the victory

38
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,210
was electrifying.

39
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,960
We couldn't wait
for the Japanese to run out of luck.

40
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,110
In the blink of an eye,

41
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,170
it was time to harvest wheat
for the Japanese again.

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,600
We really shouldn't

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,640
feed our wheat to those Japanese anymore.

44
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,990
What's wrong?

45
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,510
Keep it down. Don't scare the child.

46
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,960
I heard

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,280
that the Eighth Route Army's guerrillas
fighting the Japanese for us

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
are trapped in the mountains, starving.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
Yet we're handing all this good wheat

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,720
over to the Japanese,

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,100
feeding these beasts,

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,310
allowing them

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,470
to bully us.

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,570
Every time I think about

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,560
how Silly Tiao died
right before our eyes,

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,160
I just want to tear those bastards
into pieces.

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,360
Hasn't it been like this for years?

58
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,030
Who wants to hand over their wheat?

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,540
But if the Japanese don't get their food,

60
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,400
our whole village won't survive.

61
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,430
We're old enough now.

62
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,490
It's nothing for us to risk our lives.

63
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,370
But what about our children?

64
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,700
How about

65
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,570
we get the whole village
to escape tonight?

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,870
We could harvest all the wheat,
take it with us,

67
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,510
and burn what we can't carry.

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,269
How's it?

69
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,730
Feng Dajiao,

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,800
you're really getting old.

71
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,270
Get the whole village to escape?

72
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,760
Even if you can run away,

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,120
what about the elderly and sick?

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
How would they escape?

75
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,310
Not to mention the others,

76
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,190
just take Tietou's mother for example.

77
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,600
After Silly Tiao died,

78
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,260
she became so ill
that she could barely speak.

79
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,040
How do you expect her to run?

80
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm just anxious.

81
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,870
I know you're anxious.

82
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm feeling the same way.

83
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,760
Everyone in the village

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,490
must have thought about running away.

85
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,640
If we could run,
we'd have done it already.

86
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,070
Now you got me thinkingâ€”

87
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,190
you just mentioned

88
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,950
burning the wheat, right?

89
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,270
I think it could work.

90
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,720
Do you have something up your sleeve?

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,650
Tell me quickly.

92
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,720
Don't we hear every year
during harvest time

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,800
about wheat fields

94
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,950
here or there

95
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,630
getting burned by celestial fire?

96
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,600
Once fire catches the wind,

97
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,140
it's impossible to put out.

98
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,340
The wheat burns up in the blink of an eye,

99
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,270
and all the women in the village
can do nothing but cry.

100
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,470
I was just wondering.

101
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,040
How about

102
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,240
we harvest and keep
the wheat heads ourselves

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,810
and burn the stalks?

104
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,750
We'll tell the Japanese

105
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,230
that it got burned by celestial fire.
What do you think?

106
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,690
Haven't you seen
the celestial fire before?

107
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,159
I certainly have.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,480
One year,

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,200
Liu Si in Xiazhuang
saw his family's wheat field

110
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,830
catching fire for no reason.

111
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,970
We tried to put it out,
but it only grew stronger.

112
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,159
First harvest the wheat heads;
then burn the stalks.

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,680
And say it was burned by celestial fire.

114
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,880
Dajiao,

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
that's a brilliant idea!

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,620
Why didn't I think of that?

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,040
My wife came up with it.

118
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,510
Dajiao and I thought of it together.

119
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,680
We just feel that this wheat

120
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,880
must not end up in Japanese mouths.

121
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,430
Every year around this time,

122
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,070
there's celestial fire burning wheat.
It's nothing rare.

123
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,870
We will just

124
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,510
keep saying it was celestial fire
that burned the wheat.

125
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,600
They know little about farming anyway.

126
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,270
Of all the grain we harvest,

127
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,430
we'll keep just enough to feed ourselves.

128
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,430
Let's give all the rest

129
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,180
to the Eighth Route Army's guerrillas.

130
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,480
Only when they're well-fed

131
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,800
can they have the strength
to fight the Japanese.

132
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,540
Second Uncle,

133
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,390
let's burn the largest wheat field,

134
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,390
the one over 80 mu.

135
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,200
We can't harvest it all, though.

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,730
We should harvest most of it

137
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,070
and burn the rest.

138
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,730
Only then will the Japanese believe
it was caused by celestial fire.

139
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,120
Next to that 80-mu field

140
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,610
is the land the Japanese left
for Ning Xuexiang.

141
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,470
He's planted 50 mu of wheat there,

142
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,870
separated from our field by just one lane.

143
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,240
If we'll blame it on celestial fire,

144
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,830
we'd better burn his 50-mu wheat as well

145
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,020
to make it more convincing.

146
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,870
Uncle Xuerui.

147
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,650
Ning Xuexiang's field

148
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,750
isn't something we can burn at will.

149
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
Of his over 700 mu of land,

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,950
the Japanese farm
has already taken up 600 mu,

151
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,550
leaving him only 100 mu or so.

152
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,830
He guards it like the apple of his eye.

153
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,070
His whole family

154
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,310
lives on that 50-mu wheat field.

155
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll talk to him.

156
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,050
I'll persuade my brother.

157
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,990
Second Uncle.

158
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,560
Let me go this time.

159
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,760
My father

160
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,800
now hates the Japanese so much

161
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,250
that he can barely stand it.

162
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,870
My brother is also out there
fighting the Japanese.

163
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,400
If I go talk to him this time,

164
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
he might agree.

165
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,310
Xiuxiu,

166
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,980
you're the best person to talk to him.

167
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,510
If we decide to do this,

168
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,810
we need to act fast.

169
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,490
The day after tomorrow is Mangzhong.

170
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,750
Every year after that,

171
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,730
the Japanese

172
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,950
come to see us dry and collect our wheat.

173
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,800
We need to harvest
and hide the wheat before then.

174
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,159
Li Junyi and Fei Shuangbao both have

175
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,390
large and well-hidden sweet potato cellars

176
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,150
with heated brick beds inside.

177
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,600
We can use them to

178
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
roast wheat inside.

179
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,070
Also,

180
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,600
we'll have Jiaming
and the other young boys

181
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,730
keep watch from the mountains.

182
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,440
If they spot
any Japanese soldiers, puppet troops,

183
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,700
or the administrator,

184
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,520
they should rush back to warn us.

185
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,330
Once the Japanese arrive,

186
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,920
I'll gather all the women

187
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,720
to cry for the loss of wheat.

188
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,300
If we pull this off,

189
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,240
the Japanese might believe us.

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,670
If they don't,

191
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,510
perhaps we'll truly

192
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,440
go to the underworld together.

193
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm old now.

194
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,830
It wouldn't be a waste

195
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,549
to spill my blood fighting the Japanese.

196
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,820
But you guys...

197
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,919
Second Uncle,

198
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,240
my blood is also

199
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,240
ready to be spilled fighting the Japanese.

200
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,640
Just thinking about

201
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,630
the Japanese not getting our wheat,

202
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm ready to die

203
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,620
with a smile on my face.

204
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,550
Even if I'm going to die,

205
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,810
I'll kill several Japanese before that.

206
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
I've long wanted to skin
those Japanese alive.

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,080
Alright,

208
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,590
let's drop it.

209
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,720
We all need to stay safe.

210
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,270
God

211
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,670
is blessing us.

212
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,080
Yes, it'll be fine.

213
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,720
Tietou,

214
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,640
sharpen this one, too.

215
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,770
Mother,

216
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,030
please don't go this time.

217
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,670
No.

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
This time,

219
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,450
I must go.

220
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,510
Today,

221
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll make three vows.

222
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,420
I, Ning Xiuxiu,

223
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,920
from the moment
I step out of the Ning Residence,

224
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,920
will never step back in again.

225
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,320
Second,

226
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,310
I, Ning Xiuxiu,
will not eat a single rice grain

227
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,150
of the Ning family or take anything away.

228
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,120
Third,

229
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,200
I, Ning Xiuxiu,

230
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,290
no longer have a father.

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,200
Let's go.

232
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,870
M-Ms. Xiuxiu?

233
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,080
Where is my father?

234
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,270
Xiu?

235
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,790
You're back, Xiu!

236
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,700
I came today

237
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,390
to talk to you.

238
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,550
Come inside with Father.

239
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,880
Let's go inside to talk.

240
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,020
I want to talk about grain.

241
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,950
Let's just do it here.

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,480
Okay,

243
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,290
we'll talk here.

244
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,750
Fine.

245
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,310
Look at all our grain bins.

246
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,270
All empty.

247
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,360
It's been years since they were full.

248
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,480
Those damn Japanese

249
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,790
have occupied all my land,

250
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,400
leaving me with just a tiny bit.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,530
Do you know what your father

252
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,620
fears most in life?

253
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,630
I fear hearing echoes
when speaking in the granaries.

254
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,510
Xiuxiu.

255
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,030
Xiuxiu.

256
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,690
Do you know why?

257
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,060
It means the grain bins are empty,

258
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,790
reminding me to fill them up quickly.

259
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,960
Only when they're full

260
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,200
can we lead a good life.

261
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,480
Only with full bins can we feel secure

262
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,760
and have something to look forward to.

263
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,720
I-I'm not

264
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,320
doing this for myself.

265
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,270
I'm actually doing this

266
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,570
for our Ning family.

267
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,630
I'm doing it for all the Ning descendants.

268
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,510
How much grain can I eat anyway?

269
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm old now.

270
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
I don't eat much anymore.

271
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,550
But I

272
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,220
still want to fill

273
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
these grain bins.

274
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,590
When they're full,

275
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,730
I can sleep tight at ease.

276
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,580
I can confront your mother in my dreams.

277
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,480
I can tell your mother

278
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,480
that I didn't let our children starve.

279
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,630
At a time like this,

280
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,650
please don't mention my mother anymore.

281
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,280
I just...

282
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,290
I just want to share my thoughts with you.

283
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,060
I understand what's on your mind.

284
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,250
Whether your grain bins are full or not

285
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
has nothing to do with me.

286
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,760
I've been away from the Ning Residence
for over ten years,

287
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,830
not eating a single grain of yours.

288
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,710
And I've been doing just fine.

289
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,430
You haven't been home for over a decade,

290
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,890
and today you walk in

291
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
just to say this to me?

292
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,810
I'm here today not to talk about this.

293
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,150
What I need to tell you is more important.

294
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,270
Xiu,

295
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,490
remember this.

296
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,440
Whatever you say, Father will agree to it.

297
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,510
Dajiao,

298
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,960
almost everyone is here.

299
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,690
Let's start.

300
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,930
Start harvesting!

301
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,960
Wait.

302
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,430
Second Uncle.

303
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,870
Dajiao.

304
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,440
We start harvesting
at Mangzhong every year,

305
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,790
and we always worship heaven and earth.

306
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,520
Let's consider today
our Mangzhong for good luck

307
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,130
with you leading everyone
to finish a ritual.

308
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,030
Let's welcome the field leader,

309
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,150
Feng Dajiao,

310
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
to start the harvest!

311
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,550
Kneel.

312
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,450
Bow to heaven and earth!

313
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,560
Bow to the gods!

314
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,550
Bow to our ancestors!

315
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,200
On the Day of Mangzhong,

316
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,910
be careful with fire

317
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,790
and stay close to water sources.

318
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,120
On the Day of Mangzhong,

319
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,000
bend down to cut wheat

320
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,720
for a bumper harvest!

321
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,780
The cuckoo's call

322
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,930
reminds the people!

323
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,310
Prepare sickles for the wheat harvest!

324
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,270
Pomegranate flowers bloom
as wheat turns golden!

325
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,600
Farmers are busy
during wheat harvest season!

326
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,030
Steady sickle, precise cutting!

327
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,910
Thresh grain to fill the granaries!

328
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,910
Hard work this year means no hunger!

329
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,120
Every grain stored
brings comfort to families!

330
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,990
Leave more straw, fewer wheat heads!

331
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,240
Begin harvesting!

332
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,910
Begin harvesting!

333
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,400
Hurry up!

334
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:08,920
Hurry!

335
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,400
What?

336
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,740
Say that again.

337
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,200
You want to harvest wheat
from the Japanese farm?

338
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,839
Harvest half and burn half?

339
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,349
I'm here to tell you

340
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,640
that your 50 mu of wheat

341
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,680
is the closest
to the Japanese wheat fields.

342
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,640
If you agree,

343
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,119
we'll harvest and burn your wheat as well,

344
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,670
and you can keep some for food.

345
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,119
We'll tell the Japanese

346
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,600
that it was all burned
by the same celestial fire.

347
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,110
Don't touch my wheat!

348
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,540
Don't touch it!

349
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,350
The Japanese took 600 mu of my land,

350
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,440
leaving me only 100 mu.

351
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,720
Only this 50-mu wheat of mine
grew so well this year.

352
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,520
If you burn it,

353
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,890
what a terrible loss that would be!

354
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,110
When the Japanese
took my land, they promised

355
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,790
not to take my wheat.

356
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,630
I also paid Administrator Liu

357
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,750
to protect my land and my grain.

358
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,160
That was in previous years.

359
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,490
This year is different.

360
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,100
We've already burned our 80-mu wheat.

361
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,530
The Japanese will definitely
target your land.

362
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,860
By then, you won't harvest a single grain.

363
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,580
The Japanese will eat your wheat

364
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,240
and still treat you like dirt.

365
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,750
Who came up with this idea?
That's so messed up.

366
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,080
I came up with this idea.

367
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,890
And I volunteered to persuade you.

368
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,400
Silly girl!

369
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,800
How silly!

370
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,760
The wheat is still filling out right now.

371
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,880
If you harvest now,

372
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,830
that will be a huge loss!

373
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,610
You'll lose at least half of it, you know?

374
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,800
And you even want to harvest half
and burn half!

375
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,960
How am I supposed to fill my granaries?

376
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,890
It's a waste of food!

377
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,830
It's such a waste of food!

378
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,960
If I let you do this,

379
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,240
I'd be failing my granaries
waiting to be filled.

380
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,750
If I let you do this,

381
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,030
my heart would break, Xiu.

382
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,680
I really can't let you act so recklessly.

383
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,590
Where's Dajiao?
I'll go talk sense into him.

384
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,450
It won't help whoever you talk to.

385
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,880
Dajiao and Second Uncle

386
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,540
are already harvesting
with the whole village.

387
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,190
I've never wasted wheat like this
in my entire life.

388
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,710
You're married now.

389
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,080
You're in another family.

390
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,540
But I fear that our ancestors
might blame me!

391
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,960
Then let me tell you

392
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,550
why they would blame you.

393
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,160
Because you've been giving
all our Ning family's grain

394
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,830
to the Japanese!

395
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,690
But on the contrary,

396
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,620
if you burn the wheat,

397
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,300
the Japanese won't get a single grain.

398
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,160
You'd be a hero in our Ning family.

399
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,420
For that reason,

400
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,810
how could our ancestors blame you?

401
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,110
I've come today to persuade you,

402
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,030
hoping you'll agree to my request.

403
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,200
If you agree to burn the wheat,

404
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,720
we'll burn yours along with ours,

405
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,030
and you can still keep some.

406
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,090
If you don't agree,

407
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,680
you won't have a single grain left.

408
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,890
You can't touch my wheat.

409
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,970
Don't touch it.

410
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,400
Leave now. Off you go.

411
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Don't touch my grain.

412
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,390
Then you'll have to face
our ancestors' wrath!

413
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:33,880
Cut the heads!

414
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,080
Remember, everyone!

415
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,260
Leave more straw, fewer wheat heads!

416
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,080
Okay!

417
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,430
Be careful.

418
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,240
Come on.

419
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,720
Better to leave more straw

420
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,270
even if there's wheat attached.

421
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,830
Yes!

422
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,440
Leave more straw, fewer wheat heads!

423
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,200
Easy, easy.

424
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,070
Zhuzi, leave more, more.

425
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,270
There's a cart over there, ready to go!

426
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,780
Take it slow.

427
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,350
Alright.

428
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,800
Kela,

429
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,730
take a rest.

430
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,700
I'll keep watch.

431
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,400
Okay.

432
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,170
Xiu.

433
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,590
You can take a break.

434
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,500
Tell everyone

435
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,920
to pick up all the fallen wheat heads
from the ground.

436
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,480
Okay.

437
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,550
I need some people

438
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,180
to help me gather the wheat heads
from the ground.

439
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,980
Okay, coming.

440
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,300
Xiuxiu, have some water.

441
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,890
Dajiao, want some water?

442
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,420
I'm not thirsty.

443
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,640
Everyone, hurry up.

444
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,340
We need to finish harvesting

445
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,400
that wheat field over there before dawn!

446
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Got it!

447
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:54,920
Let's speed up!

448
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,230
Alright.

449
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,560
Then let me tell you

450
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,560
why they would blame you.

451
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,930
Because you've been giving
all our Ning family's grain

452
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,520
to the Japanese!

453
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,170
After the wheat is burned,

454
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,100
we need to show the Japanese
how heartbroken we are.

455
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,270
How can we show that?

456
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,190
How?

457
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,680
You've seen celestial fire before, right?

458
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,550
Yes.

459
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,040
A whole year's hard work is wasted.

460
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,800
When the Japanese come,

461
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,150
we need to cry.

462
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,920
Cry hard, like really hard.

463
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,600
Xiu.

464
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,880
We've finished harvesting.

465
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,390
Hold on a bit.

466
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,000
We'll burn the wheat at noon
when it's hottest.

467
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,500
Also,

468
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,270
make sure to pick up
every single grain on the ground.

469
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,100
Don't let the Japanese
spot any inconsistencies.

470
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,300
Don't worry, Chief.

471
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay.

472
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,140
Hurry up.

473
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,230
Everyone, move quickly!

474
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,380
Come on, keep moving!

475
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,780
Those in front, speed up!

476
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,070
Faster!

477
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,880
Give a hand.

478
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,530
Hurry!

479
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,930
Move faster up head.

480
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,620
Hold tight!

481
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,130
Keep it moving!

482
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,060
Go further inside.

483
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,020
Come on!

484
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,450
It's time.

485
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,990
Burn the wheat!

486
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,700
Burn it!

487
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,580
Burn the wheat!

488
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,070
They've really burned it?

489
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,280
Yes.

490
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,230
They've actually burned it.

491
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,120
Kuangzi!

492
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,020
Let's go!

493
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,260
Where are you going?

494
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,420
The laborers are exhausted.

495
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,880
I've steamed some buns for them.

496
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,810
Let's go, hurry!

497
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,620
Come on!

498
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,690
They really burned it.

499
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,260
She never discusses anything with me.

500
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,850
Should I go as well?

501
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,250
Everyone,

502
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,760
be extra careful

503
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
to pick up all the wheat heads
from the ground!

504
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,590
Don't let the Japanese find it out!

505
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,940
Got it!

506
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,640
Also,

507
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,120
check again

508
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,480
for any unburned wheat stalks.

509
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,820
Try to make sure nothing is left.

510
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,680
Okay!

511
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,310
Men can go take a rest!

512
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,740
Let us handle this!

513
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,030
Everyone, take a break!

514
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,460
I've brought buns and water.

515
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,220
Take a rest, everyone.

516
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,470
-Help yourselves!
-Take a rest!

517
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,160
Come on.

518
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:13,800
Tietou.

519
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:22,890
Thank you.

520
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,830
Thanks.

521
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,760
Xiuxiu!

522
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,220
Here.

523
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:31,790
Thank you.

524
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,590
Give me two.

525
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,730
Here you are.

526
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,920
Who else needs buns?

527
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,680
Me! I don't have any yet.

528
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,200
Come here.

529
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,240
The Japanese are coming early!

530
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,600
Jiaming, hurry back to the fields
and tell everyone.

531
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,300
Kela, you and the others keep watch.

532
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,330
Keyu, hurry back to the village
and tell them.

533
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,460
I'll go back to help.

534
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,810
Pack everything up.

535
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,790
Get ready to go back home.

536
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,650
Any bowls left?

537
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,370
Is everything packed up?

538
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,630
Take everything. Leave nothing behind.

539
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,870
Take all these baskets.

540
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,260
What a waste.

541
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,550
Better than letting the Japanese have it.

542
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,920
I meant the land.

543
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,040
What a loss.

544
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,150
Mother!

545
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,950
Father! Mother!

546
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,310
The Japanese are coming!

547
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,660
They're coming in several cars!

548
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,360
I need to rush back
and seal the cellar entrances.

549
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,290
Be careful!

550
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,840
Let's go!

551
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,810
Everyone!

552
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,570
Get ready to cry for the wheat!

553
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,150
Everyone, spread dirt
on your faces and bodies!

554
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,910
Get ready!

555
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,430
-Get ready!
-Everyone, prepare to cry for the wheat!

556
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,730
Blacken your faces and bodies!

557
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,300
Yinzi!

558
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,600
You should go home.

559
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,120
This concerns our whole village.

560
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,210
My father and mother are here too.

561
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,380
Why should I leave?

562
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll cry with you.

563
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,720
Fine.

564
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,120
Everyone, hurry up and blacken your faces.

565
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
Come on, blacken your faces.

566
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,570
Everybody! Blacken your faces!

567
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,970
All of you!

568
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:20,890
Xuerui,

569
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,140
what's going on?

570
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,900
Aren't the Japanese supposed to come
harvest in a few more days?

571
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Why are they here ahead of schedule?

572
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
Is it because you burned the fields?

573
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,900
We're in big trouble!

574
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,620
Xuexiang, there's no time
to think about that now.

575
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,750
Blacken your faces!

576
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,960
Start crying!

577
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,920
My wheat!

578
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,920
My wheat!

579
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,460
Oh, heavens!

580
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,390
Heavens above, show mercy!

581
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,160
Kuangzi, hurry up!

582
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,070
Go, go! Go back!

583
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,880
Make tea and bring tables and chairs!

584
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,730
Got it.

585
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,050
My wheat!

586
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,660
Hurry!

587
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,090
Be careful.

588
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,520
My wheat, oh my wheat!

589
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,030
What is going on here?

590
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,100
We've reported

591
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,640
this year's harvest to Colonel Fujita.

592
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,620
What happened to the wheat harvest?

593
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,870
How did this happen?

594
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,030
I'm terribly sorry,

595
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,710
I'll notify
the person in charge immediately.

596
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,160
Shut up!

597
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,840
Silence!

598
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,560
Tell them to stop crying!

599
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,370
Drive them all up here.

600
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,050
Yes, sir.

601
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,400
Captain Feng! Bring Captain Feng here.

602
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,960
Yes, sir.

603
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,520
Hurry up! Everyone, move!

604
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,530
Sister-in-law.

605
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,500
Hurry up!

606
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,410
Hurry!

607
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,210
Move!

608
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:28,780
Sir.

609
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,430
Captain Kuwata wants you

610
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,670
to explain the situation.

611
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,930
Please calm down, sir.

612
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,080
You can entrust this matter
to Captain Feng.

613
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,410
He's from this village.

614
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,120
He will definitely help you

615
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,850
investigate this thoroughly.

616
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,940
Feng Niwei?

617
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,930
Don't worry.

618
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,080
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

619
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,300
I'll make sure your grain
is returned to you.

620
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,190
Sir, this way, please.

621
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
This way, please.

622
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,540
Come on, it's cooler here.

623
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,310
Captain Feng.

624
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,510
Sorry for bothering you.

625
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,640
You're getting me into trouble.

626
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,270
Well,

627
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,350
we're familiar with you.
It's easier to talk to someone we know.

628
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,870
Look!

629
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,540
Aren't they all your acquaintances?

630
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,040
He's become a traitor
in a Japanese uniform.

631
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,300
Fellow villagers,

632
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,490
as you all can see,

633
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,960
Captain Feng Niwei

634
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,030
is a native of Ox Temple Village.

635
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,170
That's exactly why...

636
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:19,590
Brother.

637
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,440
Captain Feng volunteered for this task.

638
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,400
Did you really become a traitor?

639
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,440
He's in charge
of your village's grain collection.

640
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,750
If you want to live, shut your mouth.

641
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,720
But today,

642
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,160
you are really

643
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,940
giving Captain Feng a hard time.

644
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,780
Ning Xuerui,

645
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,770
tell us

646
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,910
what exactly happened.

647
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,720
Administrator Liu...

648
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,790
Ning Xuerui!

649
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,980
My old Chief!

650
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,290
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,840
You're always eager
to step forward at times like this.

652
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,660
Come on.

653
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,420
Tell me

654
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,300
what's going on here.

655
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,130
What else could it be, Captain Feng?

656
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,230
The weather's been so dry.

657
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,180
No one knew how it caught fire.

658
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,820
We saw the smoke
and rushed over to put out the fire,

659
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,680
but by the time we got here,

660
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,010
it was already blazing.

661
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,110
First, the wind was blowing from the east,

662
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,040
and then from the south.
There was no way to put it out.

663
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,700
Administrator Liu,

664
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,850
you're a farmer too.

665
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,070
The celestial fire hits every year.

666
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,500
Nobody can stop it.

667
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,320
You're talking nonsense again.

668
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,360
Why did only your area catch fire?

669
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,890
Hurry up.

670
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,680
Go!

671
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,510
Move quickly!

672
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,230
Hurry!

673
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,990
Faster! Come on!

674
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,830
I'll tell them
that there's celestial fire every year,

675
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,270
but whether the Japanese Army believes it

676
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,590
depends on your luck.

677
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,820
Move! Hurry!

678
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,340
Father.

679
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,310
Captain Feng,

680
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
what do you think?

681
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,640
Men of Ox Temple Village,

682
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,470
you really know how to stir up trouble.

683
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,050
Celestial fire?

684
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,830
How did you manage to think of that?

685
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,630
All of you, young and old,
are gathered here today.

686
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,240
I'll go check it out myself soon.

687
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,350
If I find you're lying,

688
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,470
Ox Temple Village will be

689
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,470
completely wiped out today.

690
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,980
Come on.

691
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,930
Captain Feng,

692
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,920
let's go explain to the officer.

693
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,470
Sir,

694
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,750
it was because of the dry weather

695
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,260
and the celestial fire.

696
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,030
Such a case happens every year.

697
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,540
I've already reported to Colonel Fujita

698
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,190
that we'll harvest early today

699
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,340
and return with a full load.

700
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,740
The trucks I brought here

701
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,310
must be filled with grain.

702
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,910
This wheat field was burned
by celestial fire,

703
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,580
but I don't care.

704
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,450
Go harvest the wheat over there now

705
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,270
and fill my trucks!

706
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,710
Captain Kuwata has already reported
to Colonel Fujita

707
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,710
that we'll harvest early today
and return with a full load.

708
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,389
All our trucks must be filled with wheat.

709
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:11,880
Look,

710
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,199
isn't that also wheat over there?

711
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,880
Harvest it all.

712
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,989
-What are they talking about?
-Fill the trucks.

713
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,440
That is my subsistence field
they left for me.

714
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,070
That's what they promised me.

715
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,760
They can't go back on their word,
can they?

716
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,670
Start harvesting from over there.

717
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,510
Start harvesting from over there.

718
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,440
Yes, sir.

719
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,360
Xuexiang,

720
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,100
your grain will be gone.

721
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,290
Men of Ox Temple Village,

722
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,030
as the old saying goes,

723
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,630
in this fickle world,

724
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,290
fortunes change over the decades.

725
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,750
Things are different now.

726
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,080
Little Niwei, who fled away years ago,

727
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,600
has now returned

728
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,219
to supervise you all.

729
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,840
I may not be able to teach you a lesson,

730
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,639
but someone else can.

731
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,810
Let's put aside the matter
of the celestial fire burning the wheat.

732
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,740
Isn't there still unburned wheat?

733
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,320
You see this truck?

734
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,690
This truck

735
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,710
must be filled with wheat

736
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,970
before we leave today.

737
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,280
As your fellow villager, I advise you all

738
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,410
to quickly harvest the unburned wheat
and load the trucks.

739
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,680
Start with that back field!

740
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,510
Go!

741
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,570
Move! Hurry up!

742
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,640
Go harvest the wheat!

743
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,040
Hurry!

744
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,820
You can't harvest it.

745
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,090
No, no! You can't harvest it.

746
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,640
What's going on?

747
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,150
They keep refusing to let us harvest it.

748
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,140
Administrator Liu, say something!

749
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,920
Administrator Liu!

750
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,150
That's my wheat!

751
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,110
The officer left
that subsistence field for me.

752
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,760
I know.

753
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,960
I've already given you 600 mu!

754
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,630
You must keep your word!

755
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,340
How can I help you at a time like this?

756
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,470
I paid you money.

757
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,360
You promised to protect me!

758
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,280
Don't talk about this in public!

759
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,030
You took his money?

760
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,990
No, listen to me.

761
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,040
He seems to have taken a bribe.

762
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,180
Today, the Japanese Army is showing mercy

763
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,130
by giving you a chance to make amends!

764
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,010
Sir!

765
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,660
This is the subsistence field
your officer left for me, sir!

766
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,170
I'll appreciate your help, sir!

767
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,810
Thank you, thank you very much.

768
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,810
I'll help you plead with them, okay?

769
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,590
I'll go talk to him.

770
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,530
I'll talk to the officer.

771
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,130
Captain Feng, just a minute!

772
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,290
Sir! Sir!

773
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,140
That land can't be harvested.

774
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,740
It belongs to Ning Xuexiang.

775
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,920
Back then, Colonel Fujita

776
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,380
promised to leave it for Ning Xuexiang.

777
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,580
Please, sir. Please.

778
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,500
Arrest

779
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,670
their chief!

780
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,750
What are you doing?

781
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,110
Chief! Chief! Chief!

782
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,430
Bullying an unarmed civilian

783
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,230
only shows what cowards you are!

784
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,730
No wonder your tiny country

785
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,990
remains poor and weak,

786
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,910
never to rise again,

787
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,620
doomed to a miserable end!

788
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,180
Shut up!

789
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,330
What is he shouting?

790
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,500
He's

791
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,780
insulting Captain Feng.

792
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,600
I'll harvest.

793
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,190
Harvest the wheat!

794
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,960
I'll do it.

795
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,080
Hurry up! Shut up!

796
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,240
Fire!

797
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,820
It's on fire! Fire!

798
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,270
What are they shouting?

799
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,420
They're saying it's celestial fire.

800
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,520
Fire! Fire!

801
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,480
Celestial fire!

802
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,590
Celestial fire!

803
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,080
Celestial fire!
The celestial fire is raging!

804
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,760
Celestial fire!

805
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,430
Put out the fire!

806
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,380
Put it out!

807
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,290
Help fight the fire!

808
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,240
Hurry!

809
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,940
Hurry up!

810
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:39,900
Celestial fire!

811
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,170
Is it really celestial fire?

812
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,570
Put out the fire quickly!

813
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,490
I don't care.

814
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,080
Tell Captain Feng.

815
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,550
I want the grain.

816
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,450
He's promised me.

817
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,960
If my trucks can't be filled with grain

818
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,880
and I can't complete my mission,

819
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,410
he'll be held accountable!

820
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,350
Captain Feng!

821
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,680
Captain Kuwata said

822
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,030
he doesn't care about the celestial fire.

823
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,120
He only wants the grain.

824
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,880
The trucks must be filled today.

825
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,440
If it's not filled and the task fails,

826
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,470
you'll be held accountable.

827
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,430
Captain Kuwata,

828
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,630
please don't worry.

829
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
I'll make sure

830
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,560
your trucks are fully loaded with grain!

831
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,660
Before tonight.

832
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,560
I want my trucks
filled with grain and back.

833
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,780
It must be filled
before tonight, understand?

834
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,310
Yes, sir!

835
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,420
You've hidden the wheat, haven't you?

836
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,110
These wheat stalks
were cut with sickles, weren't they?

837
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,110
You harvested the wheat

838
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,990
and then set the fire, didn't you?

839
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,770
Look what this is.

840
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,010
What is this?

841
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,920
I can tell you.

842
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,910
We cut that while fighting the fire.

843
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,970
If we hadn't cut it,

844
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,120
all the village's wheat

845
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,920
would've burned due to the wind!

846
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,520
You're still so stubborn

847
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,680
in the face of death.

848
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,780
Feng Dajiao,

849
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,700
I know

850
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
you're a tough

851
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,760
and fearless one.

852
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,910
But today, your reckless words

853
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,610
will cause everyone in the village to die!

854
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,760
Niwei,

855
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
you're not my brother.

856
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,030
I'm going to kill you!

857
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,710
Meiwei!

858
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,310
Meiwei!

859
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,760
I...

860
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,680
I'll shoot you right now,

861
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,150
you disloyal bastard.

862
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,920
Feng Niwei, are you crazy?

863
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,120
He's your brother!

864
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,300
I'm not crazy!

865
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,210
My father died because of you!

866
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,630
You also starved my mother to death!

867
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,030
Have you all forgotten?

868
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,790
Each one of you is to blame

869
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,610
for my parents' deaths!

870
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,440
Father!

871
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,110
Mother!

872
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,010
If you can see us from heaven,

873
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,520
just witness this!

874
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,930
Today, I, Little Niwei,
will get justice for you!

875
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,280
Feng Niwei!

876
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,760
Don't do evil!

877
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,970
Your father's death

878
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,740
had nothing to do with the villagers.

879
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,400
Don't end up like your father!

880
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,320
How dare you mention my father?

881
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,550
Shut your mouth!

882
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,050
Chief!

883
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,720
Chief!

884
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,170
Kill him!

885
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,760
Yes, sir.

886
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,830
Feng Niwei, you've gone completely mad.

887
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,030
Second Uncle!

888
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,380
Second Uncle!

889
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,490
Father!

890
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,150
Chief!

891
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,390
Father!

892
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,360
Feng Niwei,

893
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,820
your father led bandits
to massacre our village back then.

894
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,700
You're even worse

895
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,550
than your father,

896
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,960
being a lackey for the Japanese!

897
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,510
How dare you?

898
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,760
Father!

899
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,720
I know where the grain is!

900
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,510
I know!

901
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,450
Old Man!

902
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,720
You hateful wretch.

903
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,560
You won't learn
until you're at death's door.

904
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,070
Bring him over.

905
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,910
Go! Quickly!

906
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,000
Old Man.

907
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,280
Old Man.

908
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,560
Where is it?

909
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,350
Where did you hide the grain?

910
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,730
I have two conditions.

911
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,730
First,

912
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,800
release everyone in the village.

913
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,350
Second,

914
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,450
let me take my brother home.

915
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,840
Father!

916
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,800
How dare you bargain with me?
