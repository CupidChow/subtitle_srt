[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,960
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,660
Having character

4
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,479
means it's capable.

5
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,789
The capable ones

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,620
are the ones that can get things done.

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,640
This ox is definitely the right choice.

8
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,080
Was this money well spent or not?

9
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,680
Worth it?

10
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,130
Not worth it.

11
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,360
Not worth it.

12
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,340
Worth it.

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,840
Mother.

14
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,840
Mother.

15
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,660
Where's the ox?

16
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,840
Your father took the ox out
for a walk early this morning.

17
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,630
That ox,

18
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
everyone who sees it praises it,

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,560
saying we got ourselves a real bargain.

20
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,510
Your father is so happy his smile

21
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,130
is stretched from ear to ear.

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,710
They're back.

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,790
Father.

24
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,160
Early this morning,

25
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,960
I met Zhao Bianzi, Cao Laoliu's farmhand.

26
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,200
Why did you meet him?

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
He's just an ox herder.

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,920
I asked him to find out

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,250
if Cao Laoliu still wants to buy oxen.

30
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,300
If he does,

31
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,630
I'll quickly sell this one-horned ox
that bothers you

32
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,310
right away.

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,350
Three or four yuan should be no problem.

34
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,820
Three yuan would break even.

35
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,950
With four yuan, we'd make a profit.

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,660
Who said anything about selling the ox?

37
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,720
Who said we're selling it?

38
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,579
Look, even the ox doesn't want that.

39
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,020
Three or four yuan?

40
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,790
Even if you offered me
seven or eight yuan,

41
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,710
I still wouldn't sell.

42
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,680
You wouldn't?

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
Of course not!

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,910
Why would I sell

45
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,160
such a good ox?

46
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,430
Everyone praises it.

47
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,610
People say that at this price,

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,840
you usually can't even buy an ox's tail.

49
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,310
I wonder who said yesterday,

50
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,870
"Don't want it, take it away!

51
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,470
If you think we're keeping this ox,
forget it!"

52
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,410
Did that happen?

53
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,570
You were so angry yesterday
you looked like you could eat someone.

54
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,150
You really want to keep it?

55
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,270
Keep it.

56
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,150
My goodness, this ox

57
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,870
is obedient, sensible, and capable.

58
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,880
It's 100 times better than you.

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,860
If you're keeping it,

60
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,140
give me back Xiuxiu's betrothal money.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,920
What?

62
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,290
What betrothal money?

63
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,380
Look at you,

64
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,800
why be so calculating
with your own father?

65
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,270
Father, we need that money.

66
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,120
Give it to me.

67
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,240
I give you food and water.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,410
What do you need money for?

69
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,610
What are you gonna do?

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Our son is right.

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,820
He's a married man now.

72
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,270
Don't hold onto his money
and refuse to return it.

73
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,280
People will say

74
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,650
you pocketed your daughter-in-law's

75
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,360
money for rouge and powder.

76
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,830
I can't bear that kind of finger-pointing.

77
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,159
Come on.

78
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,040
Hand it over.

79
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,870
Hand it over.

80
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,600
You're getting physical here.

81
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:11,890
Here.

82
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,100
I got it back for you.

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,380
Father.

84
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,240
You can

85
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,360
keep this money.

86
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,250
This, this...

87
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,240
Look at my daughter-in-law.

88
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,710
She's truly 100 times better than you.

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,500
Father, please keep this money safe.

90
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,659
Save it to buy land.

91
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,240
Lock it in your money box.

92
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,130
Who has a money box?

93
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,950
Who has a money box?

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
I don't have a money box!

95
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,130
Look at this soil.

96
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,090
It's so loose and crumbly.

97
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,830
If this land were given to me,

98
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,670
I could make it so fertile
it would drip with oil.

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,000
Smells good.

100
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,390
Really good.

101
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,440
Tietou's mother!

102
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,570
Tietou's mother, come bank the fire!

103
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,460
Tietou!

104
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
Are they not home?

105
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,570
I just heard Tietou talking.

106
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,270
Tietou!

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
Come bank the fire!

108
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,670
Our food supply is cut off.

109
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,220
My son and I

110
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,470
might as well slit our throats
and wait to die.

111
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,330
What's the point of banking fire?

112
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,510
What is she saying?

113
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,190
She...

114
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
What happened?

115
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,800
What else could have happened?

116
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,650
It's just our family's bad luck

117
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,920
that we couldn't pick up

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,070
some rich family's castoff
as a daughter-in-law.

119
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,480
If I could get one like that too...

120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
What is she talking about?

121
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,090
I could farm more land too!

122
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,040
I could also upend

123
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,330
other families' pots!

124
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,750
What does that mean?

125
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,430
Oh, no.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,360
Did your father take Tietou's land?

127
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,440
I'll go ask.

128
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,390
Father.

129
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,450
Did you...

130
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,570
Go inside.

131
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,060
Inside.

132
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,650
Inside.

133
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,160
Inside, i-inside.

134
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,419
Old Man.

135
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Thirteen mu of land in Sesame Gully.

136
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,670
Xiuxiu.

137
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,390
Our family

138
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,480
has gained more than 10 mu of land.

139
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,790
It's all thanks to you.

140
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,210
What would you like to eat?

141
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,670
Let's have your mother
make you some pancakes.

142
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,060
What's wrong?

143
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,740
Don't you know this is Tietou's land?

144
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,830
Isn't it normal to reclaim land?

145
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,280
It's been done since ancient times.

146
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,330
Besides,

147
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,150
they didn't farm that land properly

148
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,270
and couldn't pay the rent.

149
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,840
The landlord could take it back

150
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,550
whenever they wanted.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,510
Father,

152
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,720
we can't farm this land.

153
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,510
Why not?

154
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,750
Why do you think?

155
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,730
If we farm it,
what will Tietou's family eat?

156
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,000
Father.

157
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,750
I'll go tell Susu

158
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,140
that we don't want

159
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,460
this land anymore.

160
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,630
Let's wait till there's a suitable one.

161
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,150
Right.

162
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,190
Tietou!

163
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,540
What are you doing?

164
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,420
What am I doing?

165
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,330
I'm here to see

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,220
what you friendly-looking devils are
really like!

167
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,600
You talk sweet,

168
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,750
sending me to hustle for cash,

169
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,120
but you were just trying to get rid of me.

170
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,930
You colluded with that old widow
to occupy my land!

171
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,510
Tietou,

172
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,690
you need to speak with a conscience.

173
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,220
We knew nothing about this!

174
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,570
Feng Er!

175
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,930
You bastard!

176
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,480
Is your whole family trying to

177
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,840
drive us to our deaths?

178
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,240
Heavens!

179
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,650
They’re just bullying us,
a widow and her orphaned child!

180
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,650
You'll pay for this!

181
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,300
Give it to me.

182
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,270
-Heaven will punish you!
-What?

183
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,350
The land deed.

184
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,390
I'm going to Mrs. Fei to return the land.

185
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,310
Why return it?

186
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,880
On what grounds?

187
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
Mrs. Fei gave this to me herself.

188
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
I just got it! Why should I return it?

189
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,770
You know why.

190
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,150
Are you not going to
let Tietou's family live?

191
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,200
Th-That's not my business.

192
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,430
That's not my business.

193
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,480
All I know is that

194
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,790
Mrs. Fei wrote this for me personally.

195
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,950
I've waited so long for this.
Why should I give it back?

196
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,680
I won't do it.

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,030
Feng Er.

198
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,580
Will you give it to me?

199
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,060
No.

200
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,610
Will you?

201
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,280
No.

202
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,590
Give it to me!

203
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,440
What are you doing?

204
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
You want to hit your father, don't you?

205
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
Getting too big for your boots,
aren't you?

206
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,390
They’re just bullying us,
a widow and her orphaned child.

207
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,270
You'll pay for this!

208
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Heaven will punish you!

209
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,920
What, you bully me

210
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,660
and come to laugh at me too?

211
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,150
Auntie.

212
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,240
We didn't

213
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,690
want to take this land.

214
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,080
We just rented a piece of land
from the Fei family.

215
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,540
We had no idea it was yours.

216
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Who would believe that?

217
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,120
Your family has always had your eyes

218
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,130
on my 13 mu of land in Sesame Gully.

219
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,530
Especially your father-in-law, Feng Er.

220
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,480
He's been coveting it for ages,

221
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,440
hasn't he?

222
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,650
And you and Dajiao

223
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,480
pretended to help my Tietou

224
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
look for ways to make quick money.

225
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,570
Now I understand.

226
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
You wanted to send my son away,

227
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
leaving me all by myself

228
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,600
at your mercy, for you to push around.

229
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,150
Also!

230
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,120
You invited us for dumplings
on New Year's Eve.

231
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,150
You had already planned everything
before that dinner,

232
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,030
hadn't you?

233
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,190
Tietou and I were completely in the dark.

234
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,120
I should spit those dumplings out
right now.

235
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,150
Then go ahead!

236
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,510
Spit them out right now!

237
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,640
I should've never eaten

238
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,570
those evil-filled dumplings.

239
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,430
How can you say such things
with a clear conscience?

240
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,910
If my family really wanted

241
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,360
to ruin your family,

242
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,390
Dajiao wouldn't have gone to such trouble

243
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,390
to help Tietou,

244
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,960
and my mother-in-law
wouldn't have bothered

245
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,690
to bring dumplings to your door
on New Year's Eve.

246
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,290
Also,

247
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,220
"some rich family's castoff
as a daughter-in-law,"

248
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,010
is that so?

249
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,700
You've been banking our fire,

250
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,860
eating our food,

251
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,200
telling me barrels and barrels

252
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,750
of sweet words to me.

253
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,930
What now,

254
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,310
were they all lies?

255
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,510
We're decent human beings,

256
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,480
not animals.
Courtesy is not to be tossed aside!

257
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,240
You... You're calling me an animal now!

258
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,630
Heavens!

259
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,820
Heavens!

260
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,340
They've got power
and now, they're bullying people!

261
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,990
Xiu!

262
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,090
Auntie only said those things
because she was upset.

263
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,600
Don't take it to heart.

264
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,550
I really didn't expect

265
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,030
Auntie would talk to me like that.

266
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,670
Since his grandfather's generation,

267
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,310
Tietou's family

268
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,430
has never owned even one mu of land.

269
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,940
They've survived
by renting land from others.

270
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,870
These 13 mu of the Fei family's land

271
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,270
were only acquired
when Tietou's father was alive

272
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,000
through connections
and with great difficulty.

273
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,830
After his father passed away,

274
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,990
Tietou and Auntie have guarded this land

275
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,120
more preciously than their own lives,

276
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,370
terrified that any small mistake

277
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,120
would give the Madam an excuse

278
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
to take the land back.

279
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,200
All these years,

280
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,540
they've been living in constant fear.

281
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,360
And now because of us...

282
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,240
What Auntie said was wrong,

283
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,520
but she was truly desperate.

284
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,210
That's why she spoke that way.

285
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,960
Nobody could handle such a blow,

286
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,910
don't you think?

287
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,290
I understand what you mean now.

288
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm feeling a bit regretful now.

289
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,080
I was too harsh with my words.

290
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,630
Let go!

291
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,440
What are you doing?

292
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,750
Let go!

293
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,080
Tietou!

294
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,870
Let go of him.

295
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,030
Let go of him.

296
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,270
Tietou!

297
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,030
Let go of him.

298
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,360
Let go!

299
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,130
What happened to your head?

300
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,460
You forced me to do this.

301
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,000
What right do you have to take my land?

302
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,260
I've been farming it for so many years!

303
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,860
How can you just take it away?

304
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,010
Give me back my land! Give it back!

305
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,640
Tietou!

306
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,840
Tietou!

307
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,390
Why did I take your land?

308
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,050
You and your mother
know perfectly well why.

309
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,610
What did we do wrong?

310
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,990
My father

311
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,330
farmed this for over 10 years.

312
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,390
After he died,

313
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,750
I farmed it for more than three years.

314
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,210
You can't see how I've been

315
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,910
tending that land,

316
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,380
but the villagers have all witnessed it.

317
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,930
I never let the land go fallow.

318
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,260
I've never slacked off.

319
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,530
I plant carefully every year,
season after season.

320
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,800
I've done right by this land,

321
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,150
and I've done right by you as my landlord.

322
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,810
I haven't wronged you either.

323
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,560
I should've

324
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,900
taken this land
back when your father died,

325
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,970
but I didn't.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,410
That was me giving you and your mother
a way to survive.

327
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,210
But what have you done in return?

328
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,530
Not only can't you
pay the rent each year,

329
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,750
but you also come to me
whenever you need anything.

330
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,840
Beard Liu, bring the account book
to show him.

331
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,240
Madam.

332
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,230
I won't look at that book!

333
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,070
I can't read.

334
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,510
I know

335
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,050
my mother borrowed money from you
behind my back.

336
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,530
But that was her, not me.

337
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,580
Tietou,

338
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,560
life

339
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,320
isn't meant to be lived on borrowed money.

340
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,390
Every day,

341
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,210
you give me empty promises
whenever you see me.

342
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,250
Can those nice words fill my stomach?

343
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,720
I need to eat too.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have many other tenants watching.

345
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,730
Tietou.

346
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,950
Give me one more year.

347
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,820
Just one year.

348
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,840
I promise to pay back
all the rent and debts

349
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,930
I owe you.

350
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,100
Please, I'm begging you, okay?

351
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,400
Tietou,

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
before you speak,

353
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,100
you should know what you're talking about.

354
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,360
I advise you to look at this account book.

355
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,960
If you and your mother could pay off

356
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,320
these debts within a year,

357
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,910
all of this wouldn't have happened today.

358
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,510
Tietou,

359
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,560
take a look yourself.

360
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,440
I won't look!

361
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,320
Everyone says you're the great benefactor
of Ox Temple Village.

362
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,090
But I think you're just
a wolf in sheep’s clothing!

363
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,690
You took my land
and gave it to Dajiao's family.

364
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,850
Dajiao's family already has land.

365
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,180
I don't have a single mu.

366
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,190
You're killing me!

367
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,270
That 13 mu of land are

368
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,600
like my lifeline.

369
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,210
If you take them away,

370
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,310
how will my mother and I survive?

371
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,640
Feng Tietou,

372
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,480
since you've put it that way,

373
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,010
let me be clear with you.

374
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,960
This land

375
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,160
is mine.

376
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,510
How it's rented out

377
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,440
and how it's taken back

378
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,240
is up to me.

379
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,430
Stop making a scene here.

380
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,300
Go home.

381
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,990
Put your energy to good use,

382
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,260
and you'll be able to support your mother.

383
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,990
Show him out.

384
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,110
-Yes.
-Let’s go.

385
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,410
Come on, Tietou.

386
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,640
Stop right there!

387
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,240
Tietou!

388
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,590
Give me back my land!

389
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,000
Tietou!

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
Give me back my land!

391
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,200
Let's go!

392
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,550
Tietou, that's enough.

393
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,640
Yinzi!

394
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,220
Yinzi!

395
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,770
Yinzi.

396
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,390
What's wrong?

397
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,740
What happened?

398
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,530
What happened to you?

399
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,160
It's gone.

400
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,960
What happened? Say something!

401
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,900
It's gone.

402
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,200
Everything's gone.

403
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,610
What's gone?

404
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,460
My land is gone.

405
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,870
That old widow Fei took it away.

406
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,290
She gave it to her relative Feng Er.

407
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,720
I've lost my land.

408
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,170
I can't marry you now, Yinzi!

409
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,270
I can't marry you anymore.

410
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,240
My Yinzi.

411
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,970
I can't marry you anymore.

412
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,550
You're asking me

413
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,140
to take back the land
I just rented to you?

414
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Why?

415
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,040
You think my land isn't good enough?

416
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,160
The land is top-notch.

417
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,550
Everyone knows that.

418
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,370
But we just can't farm this land.

419
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,030
Fine as long as you admit it's good land.

420
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,030
Brother-in-law!

421
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,420
What brings you here?

422
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,000
Susu, your brother-in-law just admitted

423
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,850
that the land I gave them is good.

424
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,590
I know.

425
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,360
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

426
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,700
Brother-in-law,

427
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,320
are you here to thank Sister-in-law too?

428
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,990
No need.

429
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,930
I'll go to your place later.

430
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,130
Just make me some delicious food.

431
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,720
Susu,

432
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Mrs. Fei,

433
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
I do want to thank you both.

434
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,240
But we really can't take this land.

435
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,790
Please take it back.

436
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,240
Why not?

437
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,040
What's wrong?

438
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,810
The land I gave him
was taken back from Tietou's family,

439
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,770
so it's a face issue, right?

440
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Brother-in-law,

441
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,200
you and my sister asked me
to talk to Sister-in-law

442
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,540
about renting some land to you.

443
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,240
Sister-in-law

444
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,880
gave you the best land.

445
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,720
Why are you being so picky?

446
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,110
Uncle Feng Er already took the land deed.

447
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,420
He was so happy
his snot was practically bubbling.

448
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,560
I may not know much about farming,

449
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,370
but I do know

450
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,120
that taking back land from others

451
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,250
is something that happens regularly.

452
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,360
Feng Dajiao,

453
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,200
if even Susu understands this,

454
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,730
surely you understand too?

455
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,720
Taking back farmland

456
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,070
happens every year.

457
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,230
But you're the first to complain

458
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,650
after getting good land.

459
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,200
I understand...

460
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,830
Brother-in-law,
why don't you just accept it?

461
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,200
Hurry up.

462
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,960
I didn't finish talking.

463
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,760
Mrs. Fei!

464
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,480
My family

465
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,830
has been neighbors
with Tietou's family for over 10 years.

466
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,740
We really can't take this land.

467
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,670
Brother-in-law,

468
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,320
Sister-in-law told me about this.

469
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,140
When Feng Tietou's father
was sick those years,

470
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,320
they kept borrowing money
from the Fei family for medicine.

471
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,710
They promised to repay after the harvest,

472
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,900
but they kept dodging and delaying it.

473
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,440
In the end, they couldn't
pay the full rent

474
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
or repay their debts.

475
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,610
If Sister-in-law wasn't so kind,

476
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,640
considering Tietou's young age
and their widow status,

477
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,120
she would have taken back
the land long ago.

478
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,040
Even if the land wasn't given to you,

479
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,160
it'd be given to someone else.

480
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,350
Then give it to someone else.

481
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,080
My family really can't rent it.

482
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,070
Sister-in-law is so mad she's laughing!

483
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,750
Fine,

484
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,020
you can go.

485
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,900
Tell your father
to bring back the land deed.

486
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,050
These days,

487
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,960
it's so hard to be a good person.

488
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,680
Mrs. Fei!

489
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,310
Brother-in-law!

490
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,790
Mrs. Fei!

491
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,590
Let's go!

492
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,060
Where's the ox?

493
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,280
Tied up outside.

494
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,570
Where are you going?

495
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,720
Walking the ox?

496
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,090
Why bring a plow
if you're just walking the ox?

497
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,820
Isn't the soil loose now?

498
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,460
I'll plow while I'm at it.

499
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,700
No, you can't plow that field.

500
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,790
Ignorant woman, get back inside.

501
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,340
You really can't go!

502
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,880
Without discipline,
everything is out of order.

503
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,940
Who's in charge in this house?

504
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,800
You can't plow that field, you...

505
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,570
You just can't plow it.

506
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,960
Don't be upset.

507
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
That field won't work.

508
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,160
Just look at it, alas.

509
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,160
Tietou, are you done?

510
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,750
What are you doing?

511
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,090
What's happened?

512
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,930
Dajiao, stop building it.

513
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,940
Even if you build it, he'll just ruin it.

514
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm thinking

515
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,310
we can wait for things to settle down,

516
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,160
and for people in that room to cool off,

517
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,690
then we can build it by then.

518
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,600
Mother's right. Don't fix it anymore.

519
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,640
Exactly.

520
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,310
Tietou?

521
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,280
Tietou.

522
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,140
Why don't you rest after New Year?

523
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,910
Don't you wait for spring planting?

524
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,240
Spring planting my ass.

525
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,600
That old widow took my land

526
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,140
and gave it to your second brother,
Feng Er.

527
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,600
If not, how would I be here?

528
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,510
He took that land?

529
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,490
Doesn't his family have 18 mu of land?

530
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
Why's he after yours?

531
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,480
I think...

532
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,280
He's had his eye on your land
for a long time.

533
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,940
I think so too.

534
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,660
That Feng Er...

535
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,020
Let me tell you,

536
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,980
after my eldest brother
and third brother died,

537
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,580
he pestered my Father to split the family.

538
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,920
If my father hadn't been partial to me,

539
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,140
I wouldn't have got anything.

540
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,550
He would've taken it all.

541
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,300
Who's this?

542
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,760
Telling nonsense in broad daylight.

543
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,630
Uncle.

544
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,330
Tell me,

545
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,350
Feng Si.

546
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,100
What?

547
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,200
You're

548
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,830
Feng Er's brother,

549
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,210
but when it comes to work,

550
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,740
why you can't even come close to him?

551
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,300
Get lost!

552
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,810
Everyone in the village knows

553
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,640
you were the one
who insisted on splitting the family?

554
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,350
To get the good land,

555
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,400
you forced your father to live with you.

556
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,680
For every day,

557
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,830
just eating and drinking
like there's no tomorrow.

558
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,270
What's most infuriating is

559
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,160
when I borrowed half a litre of cornmeal,

560
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,510
he outright refused to lend it to me.

561
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,880
In less than half a year,
he started selling the land.

562
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,360
How about that?

563
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,470
Now you've squandered all your land

564
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,890
and you're here badmouthing your brother?

565
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,540
Why are you everywhere?

566
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,610
Everyone knows

567
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,830
Er is notoriously stingy.

568
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,420
I had no choice.

569
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,720
First my wife got sick, then my child.

570
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,610
I couldn't just watch them die.

571
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,820
That's true.

572
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,200
Right, Brother Tietou?

573
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,950
Everyone knows about this!

574
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,550
Don't ask Brother Tietou.

575
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,920
Despite his young age,

576
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,380
he remembers everything.

577
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,070
Uncle.

578
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,870
Could you stop calling me Brother Tietou?

579
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,590
Yinzi and I...

580
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,350
Fine, fine.

581
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,400
Don't mention my Yinzi.

582
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,550
Yinzi has nothing to do with you.

583
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,640
Every time your family ran out of grains,

584
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,790
who was it that brought grain from home

585
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,190
so your family could eat?

586
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,750
You wolfed it down,

587
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,780
and now you don't mention that?

588
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,350
Hell no!

589
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,330
How come I never heard about this?

590
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,740
So I fed all my grain to the dogs!

591
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,350
Even dogs will wag their tails
when they see me.

592
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,830
Fatherless brat.

593
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,000
I have to beat you today!

594
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,880
Hiring laborers!

595
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,470
They're hiring laborers!

596
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,920
Pan Xiaogui's family in Houshan Village
is clearing land.

597
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,780
Meals are provided and wages too!

598
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,950
Coming!

599
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,760
I'll go!

600
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Hiring laborers!

601
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,200
Come on!

602
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:36,790
Come!

603
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,650
I get why you want me to send the ox.

604
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,650
You're concerned about our Father.

605
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,360
Let Father plow this land first,

606
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,050
so he won't fight with Tietou's Mother
whenever they meet at home.

607
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,750
It doesn't matter
who gets to farm this land at last.

608
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,210
It's never wrong for Father
to plow it first.

609
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,010
I'm leaving now.

610
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,850
By the way, Xiuxiu.

611
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,240
I stopped by
Fourth Grandpa's house on my way,

612
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,770
and brought you some books.

613
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,770
These two have illustrations, it's...

614
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,350
It's called Water something?

615
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,270
Anyway, it's about

616
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,440
those heroes living by the water

617
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,790
in the dramas.

618
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,740
Check this,

619
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,470
these 108 heroes,

620
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,880
each one has a different weapon.

621
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,430
Here.

622
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,560
And this one,

623
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,030
Fourth Grandpa says
it's some military strategies

624
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,190
written by Sun Zi.

625
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,360
Anyway, it's about
how ancient people fought wars.

626
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,440
It's quite exciting,

627
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,840
so I brought them for you.

628
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,760
These are all excellent books.

629
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,080
I love them.

630
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,170
Really?

631
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,820
Of course it's true.

632
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,060
I'm leaving.

633
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,190
No ox.

634
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,090
I can still farm the land.

635
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,350
Trying to stump me?

636
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,090
Not a chance!

637
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Little One-Horn.

638
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,380
Did you miss me?

639
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,040
I missed you too.

640
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,530
Good boy.

641
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,050
My affection wasn't wasted on you.

642
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,090
Unlike those in my family,

643
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,320
both the old ones and the young ones,

644
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,780
none of them are sensible.

645
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,320
They're all ungrateful!

646
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,960
None of them can compare to you.

647
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,560
Good.

648
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,700
Ungrateful!

649
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,640
Listen, Glutton Fei,

650
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,830
please spare me.

651
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,170
Your reputation stretches

652
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,970
across all the nearby villages.

653
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:18,880
I...

654
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,180
With your belly,

655
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,270
you can eat enough in one meal

656
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,190
for the three of us.

657
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,790
I'll eat less.

658
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,640
No, no.

659
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,110
I promise.

660
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,180
If I hire you back,

661
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,140
my Master would scold me to death.

662
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,270
No, no.

663
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,240
Go try somewhere else.

664
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,700
I'm going to eat now.

665
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,860
Niu Wu, send a word to my Mother.

666
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,810
I'm doing labour in
Houshan Village for Pan Xiaogui.

667
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,690
If I can keep the job for long,

668
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,220
I'll go back for my bedding.

669
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,030
Not even a good word for me,

670
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,780
and still thinking about my Yinzi?

671
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,390
Keep dreaming!

672
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,840
Dajiao.

673
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,430
What is it?

674
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,340
I was just about to go to Tietou's
to deliver a message,

675
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,740
could you deliver it for me?

676
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,830
What's the message?

677
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,790
Tietou said that he's going to

678
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,850
Houshan Village's
Pan Xiaogui family to do labour.

679
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,110
He let me tell his Mother

680
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,400
that if he can keep the job for long,

681
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,130
he'll be back in a day and a half
to get his bedding.

682
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,670
Don't forget it, okay?

683
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,940
We're out of firewood

684
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,410
and I can't cook for you.

685
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,430
Auntie.

686
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,720
What are you doing here?

687
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,140
Checking if I've starved to death yet?

688
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,190
I brought you some firewood.

689
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,700
I don't want it.

690
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,480
Don't pretend to care about me.

691
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,400
Auntie,

692
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,180
Tietou asked someone
to send you a message.

693
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,840
He is doing labour for
Xiazhuang's Pan Xiaogui.

694
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,280
If he can hold the job for long,

695
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,400
he'll be back in a day or so
to get his bedding.

696
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
He wants you to have it ready for him.

697
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,770
My poor son, you can only do labor

698
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,720
to raise your Mother.

699
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,720
Auntie,

700
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,710
even though my Father took your land,

701
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,800
Xiuxiu, my mother and I

702
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,560
are all trying to get it back for you.

703
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
We can't farm your land.

704
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,500
Your father goes to
plow that land every day.

705
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,430
It's not even planting season yet,

706
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,920
and he's already plowed it several times.

707
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,480
Getting it back?

708
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,340
Stop lying to me!

709
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,840
I won't say much more,

710
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,960
but

711
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,640
we have clear consciences.

712
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,440
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

713
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,360
Take your firewood away. I don't want it.

714
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,230
Tietou!

715
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,390
Come here.

716
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,400
We'll stay right here.

717
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,160
Come over.

718
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,470
Sleep here. We'll sleep right here.

719
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,600
Why do we sleep here?

720
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,890
It's close to the fire.

721
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,030
It's warm.

722
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,810
That's true.

723
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,670
This Pan Xiaogui is quite a cheapskate.

724
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,220
How are we supposed to sleep
without bedding?

725
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,640
Didn't they say that
we'll make do for one night?

726
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,940
Whoever finishes work first tomorrow
will go home for bedding.

727
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,870
This Pan Xiaogui

728
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,190
is even more calculating than Miser Ning.

729
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,940
This way he saves on
our food allowance again.

730
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,890
You're right.

731
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,440
I wouldn't have realized
if you hadn't mentioned it.

732
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,960
As if your iron head could
figure that out!

733
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,910
Uncle.

734
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,940
I really need to thank you.

735
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,000
You asked me
to keep quiet and follow along,

736
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,480
and got me in finally.

737
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,620
I talked until my lips were sore,

738
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,790
but finally convinced him to agree.

739
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,980
So here's the plan.

740
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,430
Early tomorrow morning,

741
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,000
I'll go back to get bedding,

742
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,510
and bring yours too.

743
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,320
I'll talk to the others from our village.

744
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,570
If one person can run back,
there's no need for two.

745
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,580
Let's see how he saves on rations then!

746
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,510
Alright, Uncle.

747
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,550
Well...

748
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
About the work...

749
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,220
Don't worry about the work, Uncle.

750
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,420
I'll do it all for you.

751
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,620
Uncle, let me stoke the fire for you.

752
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,870
So we can sleep warm and cozy.

753
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,950
[Defending bandits to protect the home]

754
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,270
Use strength!

755
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,590
Kejin.

756
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,720
Second Uncle.

757
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,160
Liu.

758
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,660
Let bros take a break.

759
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,470
Everyone, take a rest.

760
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,360
They're still training.

761
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,470
This is

762
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Commander Kejin.

763
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,590
My name is Du Chunlin.

764
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,960
Mr. Du is the head of our county's
agricultural cooperative.

765
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,070
Let's talk inside.

766
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,200
After you.

767
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,780
We really can't leave these mountains.

768
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,690
In my opinion, in today's world,

769
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,190
there's really nothing worth

770
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,420
rallying people for.

771
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
Commander Kejin,

772
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,090
to be honest,

773
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,570
Master Guo and I have already formulated

774
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,370
a plan to resist taxes
and fight corrupt officials.

775
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,090
Master Guo has been
strongly recommending you,

776
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,850
saying you not only have fighting skills,

777
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,110
but also lead troops effectively,

778
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,639
making you a rare hero
and capable commander.

779
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,510
Mr. Du, you flattered me.

780
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,270
Our troops

781
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,050
have indeed joined the Qingqi Society,

782
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,179
but our main purpose is protecting homes
and fighting bandits.

783
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,630
Kejin,

784
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,630
Mr. Du and our family

785
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,030
have quite a connection.

786
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,860
His father, Mr. Du Mingyi,

787
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,550
was a righteous local gentry.

788
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,070
He was the youngest one among

789
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,000
your grandfather's sworn brothers.

790
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,710
My nephew,

791
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,850
you have all these skills,

792
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,380
aren't you just waiting for such a chance

793
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,610
to make your mark?

794
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,440
Alright.

795
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:50,739
Mr. Du,

796
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,440
I'll go see Master Guo

797
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,040
and discuss it with him.

798
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
All right, Commander Kejin.

799
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,840
I'll be waiting for your good news.

800
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,920
Dajiao.

801
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,990
Xiuxiu.

802
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,250
Second uncle, what brings you here?

803
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,680
This Mr. Du says he's Dajiao's friend.

804
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,090
Is Dajiao home?

805
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,070
Yes.

806
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,150
Please come inside.

807
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,630
No need. I've already delivered him.

808
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,890
So I won't disturb you.

809
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
You've come all this way,

810
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,250
please come in for a cup of tea.

811
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,410
Xiuxiu, seeing you doing well

812
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,470
makes me happier than any tea could.

813
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,230
Mr. Du.

814
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,010
See you another day.

815
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,810
Thank you, Village Chief.

816
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,760
Don't mention it.

817
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,890
I'm off now, Xiuxiu.

818
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,650
Please, come inside.

819
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,360
Let me take that.

820
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,600
Not some good tea, please don't mind.

821
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,660
Thank you, Xiuxiu.

822
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,200
I'll leave you two alone.

823
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,420
Please sit.

824
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,340
Have some tea.

825
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,240
Dajiao,

826
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,920
although this visit is
to repay your kindness,

827
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,400
I came in such a hurry

828
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,650
and traveled through many places,

829
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,690
so I didn't bring you any gifts.

830
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,750
Please forgive me.

831
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,040
Your recovery is the best gift of all.

832
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,690
For saving my life,

833
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,680
I owe you a debt of gratitude

834
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,350
and should have come
to thank you in person.

835
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,470
Also,

836
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,530
besides paying my respects,

837
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,710
I have something to discuss with you.

838
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,240
I heard from Xuerui that we have a guest?

839
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,070
He's come from far away,

840
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,460
from the town.

841
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,350
We offered to keep him for dinner,

842
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,140
so I'm making noodles now.

843
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,530
I was thinking of adding another dish,

844
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,150
maybe some meat?

845
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,760
Meat?

846
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,080
You might as well cut it from me.

847
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,610
I'll go borrow a fish.

848
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,390
Borrow a fish?

849
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,060
What does that mean?

850
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,030
You're family now,

851
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,290
so I'm not afraid you'll laugh at us.

852
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,850
This is just how we poor folks manage.

853
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,730
When guests come, we borrow a fish,

854
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,140
then use the batter

855
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,170
to coat it and fry it up.

856
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,840
We'll return the fish afterward,

857
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
and then serve the leftover dishes.

858
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,860
You can even return the fish?

859
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,330
So we just eat the batter?

860
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,530
Don't worry, the batter I fried

861
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,420
tastes even better than the fish.

862
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,670
So you mean

863
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,840
you're inviting me
to work in the town?

864
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,360
Yes,

865
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,370
at the newly established
farmers' association in town.

866
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,500
Because the farmers' association
truly helps farmers.

867
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,560
We want to bring in actual farmers

868
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,470
to join us

869
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,070
and work together with us.

870
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,880
If you agree,

871
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,100
I'll apply for your salary as soon as
I return tomorrow.

872
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,540
You can bring your wife to work in town,

873
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,980
with a monthly salary.

874
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,880
After rentals and daily expenses,

875
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,850
you will have plenty enough

876
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,180
to support your family.

877
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,070
This is great news!

878
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,920
But I can't read or write,

879
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,340
I can't do anything.

880
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,660
Don't worry,

881
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,010
you can learn all that during your work.

882
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,800
We'll try our best

883
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,210
to give you tasks that suit you.

884
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,890
I need to discuss this with my family.

885
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:05,920
Yes,

886
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,840
you should discuss it with them.

887
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,100
Please, have some tea.

888
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,630
If I move to the town,

889
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,320
does that mean
I can't live at home anymore?

890
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,880
During the busy farming season,

891
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,610
you can still come back to help.

892
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,260
So I can't tend to the crops
regularly anymore.

893
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,920
I'll go check if the meal is ready.

894
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,330
I...

895
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,680
I won't be eating here.

896
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,480
Wrap it up well.

897
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,960
How can we return the fish
if it breaks apart?

898
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,740
I'm handling it just fine,

899
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,810
go mind your own business

900
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,000
and stop nagging.

901
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,290
What's up, Dajiao?

902
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,930
I just came to tell you

903
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,320
that I've invited Mr. Du
to stay for dinner.

904
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,120
That's right.

905
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,010
See, I'm frying fish right now.

906
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,000
It'll be ready soon.

907
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,690
Mr. Du.

908
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,710
Dinner's almost ready, you must...

909
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,640
I won't interrupt.
I have matters to attend to.

910
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,170
Do you still have the card
I left you last time?

911
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,070
Yes, I do.

912
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,070
Dajiao.

913
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,040
About what we just discussed,

914
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,440
think it over carefully.

915
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,560
If you decide to come,

916
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,340
I'll be waiting for you.

917
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,200
Father, Mother.

918
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,500
Mr. Du is leaving.

919
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,230
Why does he leave so suddenly?

920
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,590
The meal is all prepared.

921
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,570
Please don't trouble yourselves.

922
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,560
I have official duties to attend to.

923
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,320
I'll come visit you both another day.

924
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,920
Uncle, Auntie, I must go now.

925
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,280
Dajiao, see him out.

926
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,530
All that work and we couldn't keep him.

927
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,040
God, the fish is still cooking!

928
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,290
Oh no,

929
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,640
if it's overcooked, we can't return it.

930
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,280
Let's just eat it then.

931
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,090
You don't even know
what this place is called.

932
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,320
How did you ask the Second Boss

933
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,000
to give us such a job

934
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
of recon?

935
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,880
You know Liu Zi, right?

936
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,320
He did recon twice.

937
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,170
He's so confident
at the gambling house now,

938
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,790
because he made quick money.

939
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,010
Let me tell you.

940
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,700
This time, we brothers

941
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,670
need to risk our necks

942
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,920
to get this job done.

943
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,430
So, what do we do?

944
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,670
It's not that difficult.

945
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Just sneak into

946
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,140
those fancy mansions.

947
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,190
I've heard

948
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,160
these wealthy households

949
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,060
usually have their own armed guards.

950
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,390
We can't lose our lives

951
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,250
before we get the recon done.

952
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,000
So annoying.

953
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,480
Why be a bandit if you're such a coward?

954
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,930
I'm not a coward, I just value my life.

955
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,930
Who's there? Who?

956
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,610
Don't panic.

957
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,370
Brothers,

958
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,470
I can help you.

959
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,090
Mr. Du invited you to work
in the town?

960
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,190
My parents were there,
and I was afraid of them asking me more.

961
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,450
so I didn't mention it.

962
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,890
You'll get a monthly salary

963
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,890
and can bring your wife too?

964
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,810
I knew it

965
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,630
I wasn't wrong about you.

966
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,670
A man's ambition extends to all corners.

967
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,230
The moment Mr. Du walked in,

968
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,520
I could tell

969
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,710
he was special.

970
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,650
He is full of integrity.

971
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,290
If you really work with him,

972
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,760
it would be wonderful.

973
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,720
I support you.

974
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,300
You have all my support.

975
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,360
I need to pack our things.

976
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,570
This is really great.

977
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,400
If you work with Mr. Du,

978
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,410
you'll surely accomplish something.

979
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,930
Xiuxiu, don't pack yet.

980
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,070
Don't pull at me.

981
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,150
We're going there to live,

982
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,710
so we can't leave anything behind.

983
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,840
When the time comes, you'll go to work,

984
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,530
and I'll take care of our home.

985
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,720
I didn't agree to Mr. Du's offer.

986
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,920
What?

987
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,090
I was thinking,

988
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,920
if I leave,

989
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,750
who will take care of my parents?

990
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,880
Even though we don't farm
Tietou's land anymore,

991
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,460
my father is getting old,

992
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,140
and farming 18 mu by himself
is exhausting.

993
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,910
Besides,

994
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,460
I'm meant to make my living from the soil,

995
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,340
how could I handle working for wages
in the town?

996
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,330
I feel more at ease working in the fields.

997
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,070
You're right.

998
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,600
You're right.

999
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,910
Your parents are getting old,

1000
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,010
and they need someone by their side.

1001
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,550
And also,

1002
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,190
you can't bear to leave our land.

1003
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,960
I'll do as you say.

1004
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,430
It's alright.

1005
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:58,710
It's fine.

1006
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,060
We're all tired. Let's get some sleep.
