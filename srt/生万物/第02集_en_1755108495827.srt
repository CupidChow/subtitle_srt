00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,930
[Episode 2]

3
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,580
Let me iron
the groom's outfit for you again.

4
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,100
Sister-in-law.

5
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,790
Does our Fei family's ancestral rule

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,430
say that no guests are allowed in

7
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,890
before the bride arrives?

8
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,290
There's no such rule.

9
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,480
Then why hasn't a single person
shown up yet?

10
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,260
The auspicious time for the wedding
was determined at the Goddess Temple.

11
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,520
It's still early.

12
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,320
The tradition of waiting for the bride

13
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,870
means just staying put at home

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,660
and waiting for her to arrive.

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,660
No need to rush.

16
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's go.

17
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,840
Madam.

18
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,890
Go burn the incense first.

19
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
Any news from the Ning Residence?

20
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,870
I heard from the villagers that

21
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,330
Master Ning scolded
that Mole Cricket away.

22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,910
In a bit, go over to the Ning Residence

23
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,910
and deliver the betrothal gift list
we prepared

24
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,000
three years ago to him.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Tell him

26
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,590
I want a definite answer.

27
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,670
No more questions.

28
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,210
Go.

29
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,710
Father. Mother.

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,860
Dear ancestors.

31
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,110
The fact that I, Wendian, was able to
grow up and get educated,

32
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,110
and that the Fei family
is what it is today,

33
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,310
is all thanks to my sister-in-law's
care and management.

34
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm about to get married
and establish a new family.

35
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,240
Please, ancestors, bless my sister-in-law

36
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,020
and our whole family with a good life.

37
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,920
I'll definitely honor my sister-in-law

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,720
and treat her like my own mother.

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,500
[Memorial Tablets of the Ancestors
of the Fei Family]

40
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,240
Master.

41
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,120
Steward Liu of the Fei family
wants to see you.

42
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,430
Master Ning.

43
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,750
Our Madam

44
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,280
asked me to give this to you.

45
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,260
What did Mrs. Fei say?

46
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,510
She said

47
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,200
she wants a definite answer from you
as soon as possible.

48
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,160
What's her intention in giving me
the betrothal gift list

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,220
at a time like this?

50
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,960
Does she want the betrothal gifts back?

51
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,310
Go back and tell Mrs. Fei

52
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,230
that I promise

53
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,270
to send

54
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,320
my pure and spotless daughter
to the Fei family before midnight.

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,290
He really said that?

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
Yes.

57
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
All right. You may leave now.

58
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,200
You and Qing must keep a close eye
on Young Master.

59
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,930
Don't let him go out, okay?

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,630
Yes.

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,310
Before midnight,

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,920
send his pure and spotless daughter

63
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
to the Fei family.

64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,070
Before midnight,

65
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,620
send his pure and spotless...

66
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,200
Father, it's getting dark.

67
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,240
Why haven't you picked out
the land deed yet?

68
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,870
Mrs. Fei, you are so cruel,

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,720
trying to pull the rug out from us

70
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
at this critical moment.

71
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,120
Honey, what are you talking about?

72
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,380
Why haven't you gone to sell the land yet?

73
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,710
Stop making a fuss!

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,360
I'm trying to figure out a way, aren't I?

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,560
Get out. Get out.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,430
-Father!
-Get out, you all!

77
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,560
-What are you doing, Father?
-Get out!

78
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,660
Widow Fei, you are so cruel.

79
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,040
The 50 mu of land in the betrothal gifts

80
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,900
is the best in the entire village.

81
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,160
It connects my family's
eastern and western plots,

82
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,190
like the lifeline of our land.

83
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,700
I've been growing it for three years,

84
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,440
pouring my heart and soul into every inch.

85
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,240
And now you say you want to take it back?

86
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,310
Mrs. Fei,

87
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,900
you're trying to rip my heart out.

88
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,160
Mrs. Fei,

89
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,840
you're trying to rip my heart out!

90
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,120
Rip my heart out...

91
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,920
Is anyone there?

92
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,310
Is anyone there?

93
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,560
Is anyone...

94
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,780
Why are you yelling?

95
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,590
I'm thirsty. I want some water.

96
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,290
Thirst won't kill you.

97
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,050
Wait!

98
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,160
Get me a bowl of water,

99
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,760
and you can have the hairpin I'm wearing.

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,640
Even if I don't get you water,

101
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,550
I can still have your hairpin.

102
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,120
Aren't you worried

103
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,120
I'll tell your boss?

104
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,330
Wait here.

105
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,730
Qing, Steward Liu!

106
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,310
Young Master.

107
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,550
Young Master.

108
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,690
It's so late.

109
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,510
Why hasn't a single guest shown up?

110
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,240
And the wedding procession.

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,160
Still no news?

112
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,920
The wedding procession...

113
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,130
Did something happen over there?

114
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,720
Is it related to Xiuxiu?

115
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,160
Well...

116
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,310
I'll go see Xiuxiu.

117
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,030
Young Master! Young Master!

118
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,870
You can't go out, Young Master!

119
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,440
What do you want!

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,790
Listen to me, Young Master!

121
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,930
Please, rest assured.

122
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,140
The Ning family said

123
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,750
they'd definitely send the bride back
before midnight.

124
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
Before midnight?

125
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,910
Why before midnight?

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,150
Tell me.

127
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,600
Tell me! Why is it before midnight?

128
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,290
I could tell something was off

129
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,670
with you two and my sister-in-law
the moment I came back.

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,120
Looks like something bad really happened.

131
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,910
I need to go see Xiuxiu.

132
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,750
Young Master, you can't go!

133
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,870
Let me go to the Ning Residence!
I need to see Xiuxiu!

134
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,870
Young Master, it's dark and
the road is slippery. You can't go!

135
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,510
Wendian!

136
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,270
Sister-in-law,

137
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,610
are you hiding something from me?

138
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,480
Sister-in-law!

139
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Yes.

140
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,630
Xiuxiu

141
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,550
was kidnapped.

142
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,340
Kidnapped?

143
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,630
Who did it?

144
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,410
Big Nose Du from Chicken Ridge.

145
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,670
Young Master, Young Master!
Don't do that!

146
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,510
Don't stop me!

147
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,990
This knife of mine doesn't play around.

148
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,000
Step aside!

149
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,320
Madam, Young Master is...

150
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,000
Wendian!

151
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,170
Sister-in-law!

152
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,990
You really shouldn't have hid this
from me!

153
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,790
Young... Young Master!

154
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,550
Madam.

155
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,950
Still no news from down the mountain.

156
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,820
San.

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,440
I think this deal's going to be a loss.

158
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,670
Brother.

159
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,860
I don't think so. She's a bride after all.

160
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,980
They'll need to

161
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,840
have her back eventually, right?

162
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,270
If that's the case,

163
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,980
I'll give the Ning family a gift

164
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,390
and warn that Miser Ning.

165
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,270
Put your matters aside for a bit.

166
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,400
Tonight,

167
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,580
I'm receiving an important guest.

168
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,240
Don't embarrass me.

169
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,360
Brother, I won't.

170
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,260
Boss.

171
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,050
Second Boss.

172
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,730
Someone's coming up the mountain
with a weapon!

173
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,420
With a weapon?

174
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,260
I'd like to see

175
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,530
who has the nerve to do that.

176
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,370
Let's go!

177
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,080
San.

178
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,100
Leave yourself a way out.

179
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,280
You may meet again in the future.

180
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,570
Don't make it fatal.

181
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,390
Brother.

182
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,180
I'll listen to you.

183
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,830
My men!

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,430
Bring all the horses out!

185
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,170
Hurry up!

186
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:14,930
Yes!

187
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,270
Since someone has come up our mountain

188
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,320
uninvited,

189
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,410
let's grab our weapons

190
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,830
and make sure they don't leave here alive!

191
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,720
Hurry up!

192
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
Kill them all!

193
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,730
Hurry up!

194
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,290
Let's go!

195
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,890
Let's go!

196
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,850
Hurry up!

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,790
Come on!

198
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,620
Guo?

199
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,850
Meat?

200
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,510
Try some.

201
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,690
It's so good.

202
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,110
How thoughtful of you!

203
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,870
Come on, sit.

204
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,550
I'll pour you a bowl of wine.

205
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,480
I'll pass.

206
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,620
I heard that Second Boss
kidnapped someone for quick money.

207
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,980
Quick money? More like slow money.

208
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,370
Where did Second Boss abduct her from?

209
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,980
She's the eldest daughter of Ning Xuexiang
from the Ox Temple Village.

210
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll go take a look.

211
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,280
Don't look. Your soul will be drawn away.

212
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,630
All the more reason for me to go see!

213
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
So pleasing.

214
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,720
Boss, your guests are here.

215
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,620
Alright.

216
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Let's go out to welcome them.

217
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,200
Alright.

218
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,870
How many of them?

219
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,600
Four.

220
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,580
When Hu San comes back,

221
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,970
tell him to come over to meet the guests.

222
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,700
Got it, Boss.

223
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,060
Wendian.

224
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,870
Why are you here?

225
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,210
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,360
I know you feel anxious.

227
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,790
I'm worried too,

228
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,080
but...

229
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,960
But you are a scholar.

230
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,600
You haven't even been in a fight
since you were a kid.

231
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,720
So what?

232
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
I need to save Xiuxiu.

233
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,070
Those bandits use real weapons.

234
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,550
Xiuxiu's second uncle went to save her

235
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,750
but was driven back by a hail of bullets.

236
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,600
And those bandits have made it clear

237
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,840
that they only want ransom, not her.

238
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,480
As long as the ransom is delivered,

239
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,960
they'll send her back.

240
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,670
They won't kill her.

241
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,510
How about this, Sister-in-law?

242
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,750
Since Xiuxiu is alone
in the bandits' lair now,

243
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,000
she must be scared.

244
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Take me there,

245
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,030
and I'll keep her company.

246
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,550
I don't know where the bandits' lair is.

247
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,600
Do you know?

248
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,960
Xiuxiu's great-uncle, second uncle,

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,630
and a host of other elders are all there,

250
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,430
trying to figure something out.

251
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,900
Beard Liu also brought news back,

252
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,790
saying your father-in-law said it himself

253
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,440
that he'd send the bride to our house

254
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,960
before midnight, right?

255
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,030
Yes, Young Master.

256
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,120
Master Ning said that himself.

257
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,390
Don't lie to me.

258
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,670
Why would I lie to you, Young Master?

259
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,040
Let's go home.

260
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,460
Listen to me.

261
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,320
I won't harm you.

262
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,530
I'm so useless.

263
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,630
Let's go back.

264
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,480
Let's go.

265
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,650
That deadbeat father of yours!

266
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,370
I think he won't cry
until he sees the coffin.

267
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Alright then.

268
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,350
I'll cut off one of your ears
and send it to him,

269
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,410
to celebrate his daughter's wedding.

270
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,670
What are you doing?
If you dare to hurt me,

271
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,530
I...

272
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,080
I'll bash my head here and die!

273
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
If I die,

274
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,400
you won't have a good explanation either.

275
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
What,

276
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,650
are you trying to play tough with me?

277
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,110
Come on. Go kill yourself.

278
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,120
Come on.

279
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,260
My brother, Ning Kejin,
is the head of the Qingqi Society.

280
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,880
He'll definitely come to save me.

281
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,740
My father will, too!

282
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,660
Enough!

283
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,670
Still talking about
that worthless brother of yours?

284
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,920
Let me tell you.

285
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,770
I've beaten him down the mountain.

286
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,480
What a pity.

287
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,770
This pretty little face...

288
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,670
Don't! Let go!

289
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,250
My father will definitely come to save me!

290
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,710
Second Boss! Second Boss!

291
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,680
What?

292
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,120
Boss wants you to go meet the guests now.

293
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,920
Just a moment!

294
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,390
Second Master! Second Master!

295
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,270
What are you doing!

296
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,370
Second Boss, we can't break the rules
of the underworld.

297
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,230
Otherwise, it'll be hard to explain things
to Boss.

298
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,820
Keep a close eye on her.

299
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,080
You're quite something, you damn woman.

300
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,340
Trying to smash the bowl and cut the rope?

301
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,350
Let's see if you can cut it now.

302
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,350
Behave yourself!

303
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,880
My brother is back!

304
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Do you want to die?

305
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,350
I was driven back by gunfire

306
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,160
before I even got to see Xiuxiu!

307
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,970
Father, why are you holding the land deed?

308
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,360
You want to use the land deed
to ransom my sister, right?

309
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,430
Mother, Father finally came to his senses!

310
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,800
There's no time to exchange it for money.

311
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,270
Kejin...

312
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,400
Father... Father's going to use
the land deed

313
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,530
to ransom my sister.

314
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,150
Father, how about this?

315
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,610
Father and son should fight together.

316
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,680
I'll go with you.

317
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,880
You'll take all the land deeds we have

318
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,310
and ransom my sister from Big Nose Du.

319
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,040
And when he opens the door
to greet you, I'll...

320
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,640
Why did you hit him?

321
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,380
Kejin.

322
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,080
Son.

323
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,730
Have you lost your mind?

324
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,270
Trying to lay a hand on the land deeds?

325
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,400
I'm not dead yet.

326
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,710
What's this all about?

327
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,930
I've told you long ago

328
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,240
since you were kids

329
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,830
that no one is allowed to touch
the land deeds. No one!

330
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,230
If you won't save Xiuxiu,

331
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,530
Son, let's go save her.

332
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,240
Let's go.

333
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,720
What are you doing?

334
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,110
Give it to me!

335
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,720
What are you doing?

336
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,350
Mother!

337
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,600
Mother!

338
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,680
Mother!

339
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
W-What are you doing?

340
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,980
Why did you push my mother?

341
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,550
What are you getting all worked up for?

342
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,550
Instead of helping me settle things,

343
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,740
you just keep causing trouble!

344
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,350
Get lost!

345
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,700
Mother hit her head!

346
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,830
She's bleeding!

347
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,090
You're pressuring me, and so is Mrs. Fei.

348
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,110
Are you all trying to suck the marrow
from my bones and drain my blood?

349
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,160
Darling.

350
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,010
Here.

351
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,270
I was impulsive just now.

352
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,830
Mother.

353
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,540
I know you want to save Xiuxiu.

354
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,750
Of course we need to save her,

355
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,550
but we can't tear the Ning family apart

356
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,510
just to save Xiuxiu.

357
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,930
Kejin, what are you waiting for?

358
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,930
Go find a doctor for your mother.

359
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,290
Mother. Mother.

360
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,030
Father.

361
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,730
I'm begging you.

362
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,550
Please save Xiuxiu.

363
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,830
I don't want the family business
you left for me.

364
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,090
I just want you
to save my sister, Xiuxiu.

365
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,070
Nonsense.

366
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,270
Our ancestors passed it down
generation after generation,

367
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,000
and I've worked so hard
to build our family fortune.

368
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,260
Do you think it's something
you can discard just like that?

369
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,070
Let me ask you.

370
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,120
Can you come up with any good idea
without tearing the family apart?

371
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,510
I can't think of it now.

372
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,450
But Father, I know

373
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,760
I don't want any family business.

374
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,560
I just want you to save my sister!

375
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,880
Let me ask you.

376
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,400
Why did you take people up the mountain
without consulting me?

377
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,600
You even got in a fight with the bandits,

378
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,200
risking your life.

379
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,720
Do you think it'll still work

380
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
if we take the land deeds
to the bandits now?

381
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
Do you think those bandits will trust us?

382
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,030
Your sister would only suffer more
after you did that.

383
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
You mean

384
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,950
I made things even harder for my sister?

385
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,450
What use do you think those bandits have
for land deeds?

386
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,910
Do you think
they'd dare openly sell the land

387
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,720
or send people to farm it?

388
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,880
They dare not.

389
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,240
You are the eldest son of the Ning family.

390
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,100
Don't just come up with bad ideas
which will cost our family

391
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,420
like your mother and Susu.

392
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,060
Just get through tonight,
and it'll be alright.

393
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
Beauty.

394
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,030
I asked you if you wanted water just now,
but you declined.

395
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,860
Was it because
you want to have some wine with me?

396
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,720
What do you want?

397
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,350
I'll feed you with my lips.

398
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,200
What are you doing? Go away!

399
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,870
Who are you?

400
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,460
I'm your boss's guest.

401
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:41,760
Guest?

402
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,370
Guests should stay in the lobby.

403
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,830
What are you doing out here?

404
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,350
I'm looking for the toilet.

405
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,510
There are toilets everywhere,
aren't there?

406
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,240
Wait...

407
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,650
Keep quiet!

408
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,570
I'll kill you if you make any noise.

409
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,480
Where is the girl you kidnapped?

410
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,770
In... In the woodshed.

411
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,880
Keep quiet.

412
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,890
Go away!

413
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,000
Someone!

414
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,620
Let go of me! Someone!

415
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,090
It's me.

416
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,480
When we were kids, my mother worked
as a cook for your family.

417
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,890
They were like sisters,

418
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,570
and I was like a brother to you.

419
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,940
Do you remember me now?

420
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,960
Second Brother Guo?

421
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,340
It's really you!

422
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,520
Yeah, it's me. Why did they kidnap you?

423
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
If you don't save me,

424
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,800
I'll die here.

425
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,640
Alright, listen to me.

426
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,420
There're guests here tonight.

427
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,270
Maybe you can take the chance
to escape.

428
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,200
But this red outfit of yours is
too conspicuous.

429
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,680
Put on Jiu's clothes.

430
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,300
After you go out,
the stable will be on your right.

431
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,510
There are fewer people there.

432
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,240
Also,

433
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,590
Sis,

434
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,940
for the sake of
my mother's and my own life,

435
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,960
make sure you don't tell anyone

436
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,650
that I released you.

437
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,080
You must keep it a secret.

438
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Come on, let's take off his clothes.

439
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,110
Here.

440
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,680
Here. Have some tea.

441
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,110
We're relatives by blood.

442
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,300
There's no need for such formalities.

443
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,940
The fact that
you let me visit your stronghold

444
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,770
shows you haven't forgotten me.

445
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,800
Of course.

446
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,880
When we were kids,
we practiced martial arts together,

447
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
and I often took
the master's stick for you.

448
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,880
Here, have some tea.

449
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,940
Try this wild tea from Chicken Ridge.

450
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,830
Hurry up and go.

451
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,070
Don't hurt him!

452
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,930
Don't hurt him.

453
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,130
-Dajiao! Dajiao.
-Xiu.

454
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,010
Why are you here?

455
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,660
Xiuxiu, I'll take you home.

456
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,310
We just held

457
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,680
a farmers' representative meeting
in Changqing.

458
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,160
Our Party specially sent me

459
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,420
to various places in Shandong

460
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,640
to organize and establish

461
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,680
farmers' associations
and farmers' self-defense armies.

462
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,740
When I received the mission,
you were the first person I thought of.

463
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,390
Du.

464
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,940
I want you to lead your team
out of the mountain

465
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,070
to form a farmers' self-defense army.

466
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,720
As for what happened in the past,

467
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,580
we'll let bygones be bygones.

468
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,520
Du.

469
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,750
I think I've heard the line
"let bygones be bygones"

470
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,900
that your man here said
in operas before.

471
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,440
Well, of course,

472
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,700
things like this still happen nowadays.

473
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,880
But things like

474
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,940
turned foes and burned bridges

475
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,680
can also be seen in operas.

476
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,030
Brother, why don't I understand

477
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,560
what this mister just said?

478
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,500
Is that some kind of bird talk?

479
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,310
What's this ridiculous association

480
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,570
or self-defense army?

481
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,680
Watch your mouth!

482
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,440
What's wrong?

483
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,830
I always talk like this.

484
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,340
Ridiculous association.

485
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,480
What, are you going to slash me
with a knife?

486
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,140
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

487
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,270
Young man.

488
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,160
You're here to ask our boss for a favor.

489
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,720
If you want to invite Boss out
to handle matters,

490
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,320
you must kowtow three times.

491
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,400
Come on.

492
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,530
Kneel before me first.

493
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,240
Let me see your true intentions.

494
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,390
That's going too far!

495
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,740
Put it down! Put it down!

496
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,460
Ge, put the gun down!

497
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,590
Put the gun down!

498
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,200
Ge.

499
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,540
That's not how you're supposed to talk.

500
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,910
Du.

501
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,900
We're just here to tell you about this.

502
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,650
As for whether you want to
proceed with it,

503
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,200
we can discuss it later.

504
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,880
I'm hungry.

505
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,560
I've been waiting for you guys
for a long time.

506
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,540
Let's go

507
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,290
have a drink.

508
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,750
We'll have to pass.

509
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,690
We still have to go to the next town.

510
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,960
Let me carry you on my back.

511
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,590
I'm okay.

512
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,920
-I'm okay.
-Come up.

513
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,320
Hurry.

514
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,750
Dajiao.

515
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,850
Take a rest.

516
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,490
It's okay. I can take it.

517
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,550
Take a rest.

518
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,960
Take a break.

519
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,750
Okay.

520
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,680
Dajiao.

521
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,180
You saved my life.

522
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,920
I don't want to be some lifesaver.

523
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,180
Let's just hurry back.

524
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,930
Are you really the only one...

525
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,440
Are you the only one who came to save me?

526
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,100
So my father really wouldn't sell the land
to ransom me?

527
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,140
I just came as soon as possible

528
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,760
after I heard you were kidnapped.

529
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,400
I don't know
whether your father sold the land or not.

530
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,750
Don't think too much.

531
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,500
You'll know everything when we get back.

532
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,510
Let's go.

533
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,120
Or they'll catch up soon.

534
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,450
Does Du have something to say to me?

535
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,120
Dismount.

536
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,150
Mr. Du, Boss wants you back.

537
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,410
Attack!

538
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,620
There's a cliff down there.

539
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,280
They'll fall to their deaths.

540
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,160
Brother!

541
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,550
Check it out.

542
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,070
These three iron beasts

543
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,830
are real treasures.

544
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,550
Their firepower is fierce.

545
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,910
No matter the distance,

546
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,040
every shot is a kill!

547
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,560
Brother.

548
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,510
This is what really touches a man's heart!

549
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,310
San.

550
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,650
When will you learn

551
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,270
to consult with me

552
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,240
before you do anything!

553
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Are you darn crazy?

554
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,550
Du Chunlin is the youngest son
of the Du family.

555
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,680
He has two older brothers,

556
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,280
both government officials!

557
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,290
He's the treasure of Master's family,

558
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,150
and you killed him just like that?

559
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,640
Brother...

560
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,160
He's the brother I grew up with,

561
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,810
barefoot and sharing the same bed
since childhood!

562
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,480
Brother...

563
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,190
You...

564
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:10,830
Today, I have to...

565
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,680
Brother!

566
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,720
Brother, please don't! Brother!

567
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,310
Brother! Brother!

568
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,750
Brother!

569
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,500
I was wrong, Brother.

570
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,750
Please don't, Brother!

571
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,280
It was because I was worried

572
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,480
you'd risk the lives of our men.

573
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,900
I was worried they'd betray us.

574
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,650
T-That's why I did it, Brother!

575
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,000
I was wrong!

576
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,120
No going down the mountain
for a whole month!

577
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,500
Brother, don't worry.

578
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,690
At that time...

579
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Get lost!

580
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,480
I shot covertly.

581
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,750
No one would know!

582
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,410
Sister-in-law.

583
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,380
Any news, Sister-in-law?

584
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,960
Sister-in-law.

585
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,720
I brought you some food.

586
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,240
You need to eat well to have energy.

587
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,110
Getting married is pretty exhausting.

588
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,040
Sister-in-law.

589
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,680
My mind's in turmoil.
I can't eat right now.

590
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,990
I want to go to the Ning Residence.

591
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,030
Once Xiuxiu comes back,

592
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,890
I'll bring her home immediately.

593
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,440
Sister-in-law.

594
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,640
I beg...

595
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
I'll go with you

596
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,550
and ask them for an explanation.

597
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,400
Get me a horse!

598
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,720
Hurry up and gather our men!

599
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,440
Second Boss.

600
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,920
Go!

601
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,830
Second Boss!

602
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,790
Listen to me.

603
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,190
Your quick-money kidnap won't work.

604
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,150
I guess she's already home by now.

605
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,160
You keep standing in my way,

606
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,290
and now she's run away!

607
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,590
Tell me what I should do!

608
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,350
Second Boss.

609
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,970
Boss also said you were not allowed

610
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,230
to leave the mountain for a month, right?

611
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,590
But she ran away—

612
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,350
that's 5,000 silver dollars lost!

613
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,790
Madam.

614
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,940
We're here.

615
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,260
Sister-in-law.

616
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Is Xiuxiu back?

617
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,480
Xiuxiu!

618
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Young Master.

619
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,240
Wendian.

620
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,710
It's inauspicious to see the bride
before the wedding.

621
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,510
Besides,

622
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,970
these are all relatives here.

623
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,110
Don't make a fool of yourself.

624
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,290
We have to follow the rules.

625
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,530
I understand your concerns. Listen to me.

626
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,030
I'll go and check on her for you.

627
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,590
Qing.

628
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,970
Take care of Young Master.

629
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,450
Okay.

630
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,590
Mrs. Fei.

631
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,590
It's not midnight yet.

632
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,850
Why are you here again?

633
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,050
You're truly impatient.

634
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,340
Wendian couldn't rest easy.

635
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,270
Today is his wedding day.

636
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,640
I can't let him suffer.

637
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,110
I promised you

638
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,510
I'd send my pure and spotless daughter

639
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,470
to the Fei Residence before midnight.

640
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,950
Xiuxiu is really back.

641
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,310
Xiuxiu...

642
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,180
Young Master.

643
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,500
Young Master. Just wait for a bit.

644
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,270
Mrs. Fei, think it carefully

645
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,910
whether you want the bride or not

646
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,670
before you lift the curtain.

647
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,010
As long as she's pure and spotless,

648
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,720
she can be Wendian's wife.

649
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm relieved to hear that.

650
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,440
Wendian.

651
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,480
Sister-in-law.

652
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,030
Hurry up.

653
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,080
Let's go back

654
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,590
and prepare for the wedding procession.

655
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,230
Sister-in-law, is Xiuxiu back?

656
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,960
Didn't you hear it just now?

657
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,790
Qing.

658
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,200
After you bring us home later,

659
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,160
take a shortcut

660
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,060
to go invite the master of ceremonies,
Ning Xueshi.

661
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,450
Invite all the relatives and neighbors

662
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,240
along the way

663
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,060
and tell them

664
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,610
the bride has been delivered to our house
before midnight.

665
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,050
Got it.

666
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,480
Great, Xiuxiu is really back.

667
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,940
Wendian, let's go home.

668
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,250
Wash your face

669
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,310
and get changed into the groom's outfit.

670
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,480
Let's get ready for the wedding

671
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,940
and receiving the guests.

672
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,930
Sister-in-law, Xiuxiu is really back.

673
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,910
You have to listen to me now.

674
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,620
I promise

675
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,030
you'll have

676
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,760
a grand and honorable wedding,

677
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,000
proudly bringing

678
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,400
the Fei family's new bride home.

679
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,000
Sister-in-law.

680
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,510
I'll do as you say.

681
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,270
Let's go.

682
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,590
Let's go, Young Master.

683
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,590
Xiuxiu is back.

684
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,010
Be careful.

685
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,670
Beard Liu! Beard Liu!

686
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,550
Coming, Madam.

687
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,200
Quickly send someone to guard the door

688
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,070
and get ready to welcome the bride
and carry in the dowry.

689
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,960
No problem.

690
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,000
Sister-in-law.

691
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,830
What can I do?

692
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,510
Hurry up and get changed,
and tie the bridal bouquet.

693
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,750
Let's go.

694
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,350
Okay.

695
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,510
Congratulations.

696
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,550
Thanks. Thanks.

697
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,240
The bride is so beautiful.

698
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,920
Good luck.

699
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,160
Thanks. Thanks.

700
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,360
Come on in. Come on in.

701
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,670
Third Uncle.

702
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,800
Third Uncle.

703
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,770
What took you so long?

704
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,710
Thanks. Thanks.

705
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,190
You're welcome.

706
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,790
Come on in.

707
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,330
How do I look?

708
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,950
Let's go.

709
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,840
Your clothes are still wrinkled.

710
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,100
Better now?

711
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,440
Wendian.

712
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,920
This wedding hasn't come easy.

713
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,550
Soon you'll have to
perform the wedding ceremony,

714
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,530
the bride must enter the bridal chamber
to receive blessings,

715
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,190
and you'll have to entertain the guests.

716
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,870
None of these can be skipped.

717
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,800
I understand, Sister-in-law.

718
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,070
I'm not finished yet.

719
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,440
I just want you to know

720
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,110
that whatever I arrange

721
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,440
is for your own good.

722
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,710
You have to complete this wedding

723
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,630
with me.

724
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,590
So,

725
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,880
just do as I say, okay?

726
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,840
Sister-in-law,

727
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,320
why do you keep repeating these words?

728
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,010
I understand. Xiuxiu is back,

729
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,960
and this is our survival
after the calamity.

730
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,070
I will make sure the wedding

731
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,930
is decent, grand, and honorable.

732
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,000
Do as I say.

733
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,950
Do I look good?

734
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,340
Very handsome.

735
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,330
Young Mistress has arrived!

736
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,350
Sister-in-law, you're here.

737
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,090
It's late at night,
so let's skip the instruments.

738
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,530
Mrs. Fei.

739
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,290
Our Ning family has delivered
the bride here

740
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,930
before midnight.

741
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
Thank you for your hard work,
Young Master Kebi.

742
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,480
Please go in for a drink.

743
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,640
I won't attend the banquet.

744
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,440
Uncle is still waiting for me
to go back and report.

745
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,960
Sorry for the trouble.

746
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,740
Thank you, Madam!

747
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,450
Congratulations!

748
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Thanks.

749
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,670
Hurry up.

750
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,280
Here comes the bride!

751
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,470
Here comes the bride!

752
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,870
Here comes the bride!

753
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,800
Bride.

754
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,170
Please get off.

755
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,800
Bride.

756
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,200
We're home.

757
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,570
Please get off.

758
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,550
Come on.

759
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,780
Cross the threshold.

760
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,760
Step over the fire basin,

761
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,500
ward off evil and dispel demons.

762
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,440
Scatter the bran.

763
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,430
Bran scattered means

764
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,590
abundant descendants.

765
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,960
Scatter the bran this year,

766
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,280
and you'll have a son next year.

767
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,040
Now, step over the doorstep.

768
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,880
The auspicious time has come!

769
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,800
Hold the wedding ribbon tight!

770
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,840
Congratulations!

771
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,870
Groom and bride,
take your places for the wedding ceremony.

772
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,040
Hooray!

773
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,760
First, kowtow to Heaven and Earth,

774
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,900
and to all the gods and spirits.

775
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,450
First kowtow.

776
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,090
Second kowtow.

777
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,820
Third kowtow.

778
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Rise.

779
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,600
Second, kowtow to the broom's parents

780
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,840
in thanks for their nurturing.

781
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,380
Since the parents are absent,

782
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,320
kowtow to your sister-in-law!

783
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,070
Alright!

784
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,710
No, no.

785
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,030
This won't do, Uncle Xueshi.

786
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,510
No, no, no.

787
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,310
You've maintained your purity
and upheld the proper way,

788
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,770
caring for your own integrity—

789
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,500
truly a person of great virtue.

790
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,260
You arranged the marriage
on behalf of your late ancestors,

791
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,130
ensuring the Fei family's lineage
continues.

792
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,030
You're truly a meritorious figure
of the Fei family.

793
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,070
You should be honored with this rite
to commend your virtue.

794
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,920
You deserve their respectful bow.

795
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,070
Please sit.

796
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,030
Mrs. Fei, you deserve this.

797
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,110
Please sit.

798
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,030
Kneel!

799
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,190
Xiuxiu. Xiuxiu.

800
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,570
First Kowtow.

801
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,750
Second Kowtow.

802
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,840
Third Kowtow.

803
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,000
Serve tea!

804
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,940
Take it. It's my gift for you.

805
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,750
Rise.

806
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,560
Bride and groom, bow to each other.

807
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,400
First bow.

808
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,590
Second bow.

809
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,840
Third bow.

810
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,530
The ceremony is completed!

811
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,390
Great!

812
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,760
May the newlyweds be blessed with
endless happiness.

813
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,890
May you soon have children
and enjoy health and harmony.

814
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,640
Now, enter the bridal chamber!

815
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,960
Great!

816
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,170
Enter the bridal chamber.

817
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,980
Great!

818
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,590
This way, please.

819
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,190
Be careful. Careful.

820
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,170
Don't push.

821
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,910
Wendian.

822
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,390
With so many people watching,

823
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,110
the bride must be shy.

824
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,070
Look at the bride yourself later.

825
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,330
You all must have waited long.

826
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,790
Let's start the banquet.

827
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,840
Steward Liu, go get the banquet started.

828
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,550
Great!

829
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,840
Time for the banquet!

830
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,510
Time for the wedding wine!

831
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,150
Wendian.

832
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,070
Those who've come to congratulate you
so late at night

833
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,080
are all our benefactors.

834
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,440
You must entertain them well.

835
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,030
Yes.

836
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,230
Qing.

837
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,700
Take Young Master to greet the guests.

838
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,440
Got it. Young Master.

839
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,170
Sister-in-law, wait a moment.

840
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,320
Xiuxiu.

841
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,090
You must be tired.

842
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Have a good rest.

843
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,030
I'll come back to you later.

844
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,510
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.

845
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,920
I will make sure everyone's entertained.

846
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,670
Okay.

847
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,320
Qing, let's go.

848
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,630
Young Master.

849
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,440
Go. Go.

850
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,270
Watch the door.

851
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,210
Got it.

852
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,470
Susu, is that you?

853
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,840
Mrs. Fei.

854
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,110
How did you know it was me?

855
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Mrs. Fei.

856
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,510
I...

857
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,670
I didn't mean to lie to you and Wendian.

858
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,870
Are you hungry?

859
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,920
I'm starving.

860
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,030
Take off your cloak.

861
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,530
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

862
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,900
Come on, eat.

863
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,790
I can eat all these?

864
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,880
They're all prepared for you. Eat up.

865
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,410
Mrs. Fei, you're so nice.

866
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,760
Susu,

867
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,670
what's this really about?

868
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,670
My father said
once I got on the bridal sedan,

869
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,360
he'd have time to save my sister.

870
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,550
When my sister comes back,

871
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,670
he'll take me away.

872
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,190
Mrs. Fei,

873
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,480
you won't blame me, will you?

874
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,870
I didn't mean to lie to you.

875
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,470
I'm doing this for my sister.

876
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,550
I know.

877
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,120
Susu, you're a good girl.

878
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,880
By doing this,
you did not only help your sister,

879
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,280
but also all of us.

880
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,840
I won't blame you.

881
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,610
Just stay here with peace of mind.

882
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,110
If you feel sleepy after eating,

883
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,240
you can sleep first.

884
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,660
But remember one thing.

885
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,140
Don't let anyone

886
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,190
know who you are,

887
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,440
including Wendian.

888
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,880
If anyone else finds out,

889
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,840
you won't be able to help your sister.
Understand?
