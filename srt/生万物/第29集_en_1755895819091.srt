[Episode 29]

3
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,170
What are...

4
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,509
What are you doing?

5
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,240
You bastard!

6
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,680
I'd rather feed dogs and pigs

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
than waste food on you.

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,789
Let go...

9
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,580
Let go of my father!

10
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,200
Father, run!

11
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,600
You came to my door to teach her
dirty tricks against me!

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,780
Where's your conscience?

13
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,130
I'm telling you, from today on,

14
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,910
there'll be no more handouts for you!

15
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,590
Get lost!

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,260
Well...

17
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,030
since you married my daughter Yinzi,

18
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,240
you're my son-in-law!

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,300
And you have to provide for me!

20
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,930
I'm truly cursed to

21
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,280
have met a poor wretch like you!

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,720
You...

23
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Yinzi!

24
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,890
Come on, let's go inside!

25
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,700
Don't let the wind chill the baby
in your belly.

26
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,300
If you bully my father again,

27
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,660
I won't forgive you!

28
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,170
I didn't bully him.

29
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,630
He was teaching you dirty tricks,

30
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,310
so I just taught him a lesson.

31
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,310
Come on, let's go inside.

32
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,050
Kuangzi made millet porridge for you.

33
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,160
I don't want it!

34
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240
Come on, let's go inside.

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,360
Come on, come on.

36
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,190
I don't want it!

37
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,740
What are you doing?

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,880
Lead me back inside.

39
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,910
Come on, lead me inside on the leash.

40
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,880
Come on, come on.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,430
We came back this time

42
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,710
to get the landlords to
open their granaries...

43
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,520
Wendian!

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,920
Susu is here.

45
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,920
-Young Master.
-Why are you here?

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Jia, Xinming,

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,740
you go ahead first.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,750
Refine the plan further.

49
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,750
-Alright.
-Okay.

50
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,079
Why are you two here?

51
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,540
Sister-in-law sent me to look after you.

52
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,910
I can help you with your important work
while I'm here.

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,320
Qing, you can go back first.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,000
Tell Sister-in-law
that you've brought me here safely.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,060
Madam said I should make sure
everything's settled

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,990
before I return.

57
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,960
Alright, then.

58
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,680
Then go back and tell Madam

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,670
that I'll take care of everything.

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,200
Give it to me.

61
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,140
Alright.

62
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,740
Then I'll head back now.

63
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,320
Come with me.

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,150
What?

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,100
The porridge is getting cold.
Why aren't you eating it?

66
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,560
Fine, fine, you win!

67
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,510
Have your father send
your second uncle and his family away,

68
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,240
and I'll have Kuangzi send grain over
right away!

69
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,640
You've really grabbed me by the throat.

70
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,530
Without uttering a single word
from those precious lips,

71
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,460
you still get everything your way.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,450
It's hot.

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,920
It's hot.

74
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,850
Hot. Hot.

75
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Blow on it.

76
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,450
I'll blow on it.

77
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,390
Send them more.

78
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,040
A seaso's grain,
six months of dried sweet potatoes.

79
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,800
Susu,

80
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,050
we're currently

81
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,240
busy helping disaster refugees

82
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,909
while also preparing for the new semester,

83
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,520
so conditions here...

84
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,700
are pretty rough.

85
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,270
I can only ask you to bear with it
for a couple of days.

86
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,310
I don't mind at all.

87
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,870
I just need a place to sleep.

88
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,990
I've come here to help you with
your important work.

89
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,870
Oh, Wendian,

90
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,490
I forgot to tell you.

91
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,680
Sister-in-law said
we're out of grain at home.

92
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,960
We can't distribute grain to the refugees.

93
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,240
Out of grain?

94
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,470
My sister-in-law said that?

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
I told her that,

96
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,810
hoping she would take the lead

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,320
in distributing grain to the refugees.

98
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,680
I shouldn't have said that, right?

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
It's alright.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,850
You were just trying to help me.

101
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,070
I know.

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,630
But Susu,

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,620
from now on, no matter what it is,

104
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,770
let's discuss it first

105
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,570
before taking any action, okay?

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,110
Alright.

107
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,240
You should get some rest now.

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,390
I'm going out for a bit.

109
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,520
Where are you going?

110
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,870
I'm going home to check on things.

111
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll go with you.

112
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,510
No need, I can go by myself.

113
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
You rest here.

114
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,090
Did I do something wrong again?

115
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,610
This is the last one. See for yourself.

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,290
Sister-in-law,

117
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,450
of all our granaries,

118
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,130
is this

119
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,620
all the grain we have left?

120
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,500
That's right.

121
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,650
You haven't been home for years,

122
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,180
so you don't know
what's been happening here.

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,130
Year after year, disasters strikeâ€”

124
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,100
sometimes locusts, sometimes drought.

125
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,560
We've never been able to
collect the full rent in any year.

126
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
I've always been soft-hearted.

127
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,810
I give grain to whoever comes

128
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,740
asking for it,

129
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,000
thinking there would always be more grain.

130
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,980
But who would've thought we'd face
another severe drought this year?

131
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,510
I understand you want me to
distribute grain.

132
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,360
The newspapers have also reported

133
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,730
that many landlords and wealthy families
have distributed grain.

134
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,850
It's a good deed. It's virtuous.

135
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,270
But our family...

136
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,090
only has this much grain left.

137
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,230
I have to budget carefully.

138
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,200
We need this grain
to sustain our whole family

139
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,900
until this year's harvest.

140
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,140
And we still don't know

141
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,760
what this year's harvest will be like.

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,850
Sister-in-law.

143
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,750
You really should have written
to me earlier

144
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,080
about the situation at home.

145
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
I have a salary.

146
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,040
I could have sent money back
to help with household expenses.

147
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,300
Now, all my money has gone to help others,

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,850
but not a single penny
has gone to my own family.

149
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,530
We don't need your support.

150
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,060
You're doing important work out there.

151
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,980
I can't hold you back.

152
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,850
But those superiors of yours, seriously...

153
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,980
How could they give you such a task?

154
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,750
In times like these,
who wouldn't flinch at the idea of

155
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,120
handing out grain? It makes enemies.

156
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,260
If you didn't know those people,
that would be one thing,

157
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,720
but around here,
everyone knows each other.

158
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,330
Why don't you

159
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,270
let your two students handle this?

160
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,570
Think of it as asking for donations.

161
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,370
Whatever they can collect
is better than nothing.

162
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,840
Sister-in-law,

163
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,840
with so many disaster refugees
outside now,

164
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,920
relying on just two people
to ask for donations

165
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,320
won't solve the problem.

166
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,470
We still need to rely on those with meansâ€”

167
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,730
landlords and wealthy familiesâ€”
to open their granaries.

168
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,810
Given our family's current situation...

169
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,010
I'll head back first.

170
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
I'll try to think of another way.

171
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,660
Susu has never stayed away
from home before.

172
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,940
Take good care of her.

173
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,320
I will.

174
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,120
Don't lead them to stir up trouble!

175
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,910
Qing!

176
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,630
You'll lose your hand!

177
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,430
Listen,

178
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,390
if you stick your hand in
while this wheel's turning,

179
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,650
it'll be a bloody mess.

180
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,700
Go back to your work.

181
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,280
Qing?

182
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,830
Want to learn?

183
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,080
Yes, I do.

184
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,080
I'll teach you.

185
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,010
Really, Young Master?

186
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,740
Yes, really.

187
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,900
But I can't teach you for free.

188
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,510
You need to trade something with me.

189
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,820
I don't have anything.

190
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,330
Just tell me where my sister-in-law

191
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,260
hides the grain.

192
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,240
What grain?

193
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,510
I don't know anything.

194
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,370
You don't know?

195
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,760
Young Master,

196
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,570
I didn't say anything.

197
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
A-A-And don't ask me.

198
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,240
I really don't know about that.

199
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,500
I-I still have work to do.

200
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,760
I need to get back to it.

201
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,320
I'll...

202
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll get back to work now!

203
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,510
Xiu!

204
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,990
Yinzi!

205
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,160
Xiu!

206
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,410
Be careful.

207
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,650
What's the matter?

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,920
I came to ask

209
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,560
if you know

210
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,910
how much grain Ning Xuexiang has

211
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,930
in his granaries.

212
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,080
Could you persuade him to open his granaries
and distribute grain

213
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,540
to the disaster refugees?

214
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
Me? Persuade him?

215
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,120
To be honest, Xiu,

216
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,470
all these years after marrying him,

217
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,030
your father has never let me
touch the granary keys.

218
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,890
He keeps them tied to his body
even when he's asleep.

219
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,710
My parents' family depends on
your father's support,

220
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,680
so he's always been wary of me.

221
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,720
And you know how I am.

222
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,030
I'm feisty.

223
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,960
Whatever he forbids me to touch,

224
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,720
I won't even glance at.

225
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,360
But seeing him go in
and out of the granaries

226
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,390
every day,

227
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,290
I can get a general idea.

228
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,210
How much?

229
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,970
Both granaries should be completely full.

230
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,550
But asking me to persuade him...

231
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,370
I don't think I can do it.

232
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,720
It depends on
how much he's willing to give

233
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,580
and if he's willing to give at all.

234
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,510
What if I could convince my brother?

235
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,800
If I could get Kejin to persuade him,
would that work?

236
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,810
I think that'd be even less likely.

237
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,330
Your father has three treasures
in his heart:

238
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,780
his land, the grain,

239
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,740
and now the baby in my belly.

240
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,330
These three are his highest priorities.

241
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,050
Not just your brotherâ€”

242
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,910
even if God himself came down
and asked him to distribute the grain,

243
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,240
he still wouldn't do it.

244
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,580
I wish I could help you.

245
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,200
My brother isn't at home.

246
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Yinzi said that the granaries should be
full of grain.

247
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,390
Dajiao has already found out

248
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,540
about the weapons held by the militia.

249
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,720
Kejin went to the county town.

250
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,460
They said he'd be back in three days,

251
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,060
but it's been seven days now,

252
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,520
and we still don't know when he'll return.

253
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,790
Fei Wu says

254
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,760
that Ning Xuexiang is also afraid
that the refugees might cause trouble.

255
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,470
Therefore,

256
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,170
every three days, he provides
the militia with a meal

257
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,060
and has them patrol and practice shooting,

258
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,080
all because he's afraid
the refugees might steal the grain.

259
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,180
Getting my father
to distribute the grain voluntarily

260
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,710
is pretty much impossible.

261
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,080
I'll have to wait for my brother
to return.

262
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,760
How did it go?

263
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,330
I did exactly what you told me
and spoke to Qing,

264
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,470
and I got it out of her right away.

265
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,950
Turns out my sister-in-law has moved
the grain to the pharmacy in town.

266
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,950
In two trips.

267
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,910
Tietou.

268
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,800
How's everything on your end?

269
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,280
I've got all my men ready.

270
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,970
They'll help us
distribute the grain anytime.

271
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,700
Don't worry.

272
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,530
If my sister-in-law is

273
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,240
the first one in our village
to distribute the grain...

274
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,150
Then my father

275
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,980
will get the message too.

276
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,450
We should act now.

277
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,930
Let's quickly organize
the first grain distribution.

278
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,510
Slow down, slow down.

279
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,340
Our lifesavers!

280
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,000
There's enough for all of you!

281
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,870
Please get up! Get up!

282
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,690
There's enough for all of you!

283
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't rush!

284
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,930
Don't push! There's enough for all of you!

285
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,010
Everyone, please don't push!

286
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,480
Don't push! Don't push!

287
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,080
We have plenty of grain!

288
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,150
Everyone who comes will get a share!

289
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,840
Form a line, please! Line up!

290
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,790
Line up, everyone.

291
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,630
Madam,

292
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,510
something bad has happened!

293
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,510
I haven't asked you yet.

294
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,110
Thank you.

295
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,410
How did you discover where Mrs. Fei

296
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,570
hid the grain?

297
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,880
Wendian noticed some rice grains

298
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,120
on the ground at the doorstep,

299
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,110
so he guessed that Sister-in-law
had hidden the grain away.

300
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,510
Then I told Qing

301
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,450
that the disaster refugees had looted
the grain.

302
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,550
Qing said, "No way.

303
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,840
How would the refugees know
that Madam had hidden the grain

304
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,520
in the warehouse in town?"

305
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,510
As soon as I heard that, I understood,

306
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,970
and I came back to tell you.

307
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,890
You clever little one.

308
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,760
Here.

309
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,730
Come on, come on.

310
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,410
Everyone, line up properly.

311
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,910
Niu Wu, mark them clearly!

312
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,810
Grain distribution here,
porridge over there!

313
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,340
Everyone, you can go over there
for porridge!

314
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,240
Come on, don't worry,
there's enough for all of you!

315
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,080
We've prepared plenty of grain!

316
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,000
Each one of you will get a share!

317
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
Beard Liu, stop the cart. Stop the cart!

318
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,080
Madam,

319
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,670
why aren't we going over?

320
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,300
Be careful.

321
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,230
Lifesaver! Lifesaver!

322
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,410
Thanks to you,
both of my children survived.

323
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,150
Suozhu, kneel down.

324
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,610
Suozhu.

325
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,080
Quickly, thank our lifesaver.

326
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,240
Come on, let me give you some more.

327
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,720
We've received the grain.

328
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,670
Here.

329
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,840
Thank you so much.

330
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,020
Thank you for your great kindness.

331
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,680
Be good with your mom, Suozhu!

332
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,550
Don't cry now, come on.

333
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,350
No more tears.

334
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,540
Let's not go over there.

335
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,380
Let's go back.

336
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,190
W-We're leaving just like that?

337
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,970
So many people are watching.

338
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,650
If our own family starts quarreling there,

339
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,380
we'll become a laughingstock.

340
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,310
Let's go back!

341
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,630
They've really taken charge now.

342
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,080
There's porridge ready over there.

343
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
Thank you. Thank you.

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Come on, this way, sir.

345
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,670
Boss.

346
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,900
How's it going?

347
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,440
They've given out food to a lot of them.

348
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,210
How many refugees are there?

349
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,240
Several hundred, I'd say.

350
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,370
That many refugees?

351
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,360
Thank you. Thank you.

352
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,950
You're welcome.

353
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't push. Don't push.

354
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:23,970
Here.

355
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,960
Wendian!

356
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,490
Alright.

357
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,710
Come on, cover for me.

358
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,380
Line up properly, line up.

359
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,120
Father, why are you still up so late?

360
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,380
Were you waiting for me?

361
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,780
I just asked you to deliver
a birthday gift to your Uncle Bian,

362
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,190
but you took so long.

363
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,320
With all those disaster refugees
coming in waves,

364
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,830
I'm afraid they'll steal my grain.
How could I sleep?

365
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,950
What are you afraid of?

366
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,210
I'm back now, aren't I?

367
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,070
I brought you some fine wine
and meat, Father!

368
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,230
Come to my room for a drink?

369
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,360
I don't want to move.

370
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Let's drink here.

371
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,690
Here...

372
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,770
Well...

373
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,570
Yinzi is sleeping in the backyard.

374
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,390
We're the only ones here.

375
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,650
Then, come on, Father!

376
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,420
I've got some good news to tell you.

377
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,089
You two keep a close watch here

378
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,650
and find out
who's distributing grain inside.

379
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,400
I'll go back to report to the superiors
and bring people to make the arrest.

380
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,250
If we can really catch a Communist
from this,

381
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,940
we can swagger all we want

382
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,240
in the Communist-hunting squad.

383
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,970
Understand?

384
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,280
Boss, don't worry.

385
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,780
We'll definitely keep a good watch
for you.

386
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,710
Keep your eyes peeled, both of you.

387
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,030
I remember now.

388
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,710
One cup is enough for me.

389
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,830
Yinzi doesn't allow me to drink.
So, I won't drink anymore.

390
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,510
You won't drink with me,

391
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,810
but you're eating so much of the chicken
I bought.

392
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,570
You old man.

393
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,200
This time, when you asked me
to deliver the birthday gift to

394
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,110
Uncle Bian,
it was exactly the right thing to do!

395
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,440
He was overjoyed when he saw the gift

396
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,430
and introduced his favorite student,
Zhao Shizheng,

397
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,270
to me!

398
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,830
That man is quite something!

399
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,060
He's the police chief
of the county police station!

400
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,270
He loves to drink!

401
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,430
I drank with him for three days straight,
drunk for three days!

402
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,120
We became sworn brothers

403
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,510
and wished we had met sooner!

404
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,440
He's the elder brother,
and I'm the younger, Father.

405
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,200
He really likes me.

406
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,360
He said, "Brother,

407
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,740
there's a lucrative position vacant

408
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,090
in the county right nowâ€”

409
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,440
the head of the militia bureau."

410
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,310
He's been in charge of both positions.
There just isn't anyone suitable.

411
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,460
When he saw me, he said, "Brother,

412
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,000
this position is absolutely

413
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,030
made for you!"

414
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,250
Father, isn't that great news, Father?

415
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,350
Father, Father.

416
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,640
Father, I'm too excited.

417
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,200
And my sworn brother said

418
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,760
it wouldn't cost much.

419
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,070
Once we give him the money,

420
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,870
he'll smooth things over for us.

421
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,130
Within two months,

422
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,960
I'll be sitting in
that prestigious position.

423
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,990
And if you write another letter
to Uncle Bian

424
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,330
and we coordinate from both ends,

425
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,990
this will work out, Father...

426
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,450
That's good news,

427
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,410
but stop patting me like that.

428
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,400
Sit down. Listen to me first.

429
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,260
Right now, everyone is demanding

430
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,950
that wealthy landlords distribute grain.

431
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,270
You must guard our granaries well.

432
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,220
You need to keep them away
from our granaries.

433
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,740
Don't let those disaster refugees

434
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,310
take my grain.

435
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,130
Secondly,

436
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,270
you must also protect me

437
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,350
from those troublemakers

438
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,580
who might lead these poor folks

439
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,830
to force me to distribute grain!

440
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,070
Xiuxiu.

441
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,590
Seeing those disaster refugees
eat their fill,

442
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,330
I feel as though I've made it through
this hardship too.

443
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,750
Now I cook porridge in a way
that both saves firewood

444
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,210
and makes it nice and soft.

445
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,310
Xiuxiu.

446
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,240
Where's Dajiao?

447
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,850
Haven't seen him.

448
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,890
I've searched several streets
but have found no trace of him.

449
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,890
It's weird.

450
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,510
Where did he go in the blink of an eye?

451
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,880
Dajiao hasn't returned yet?

452
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,750
This is the place! This is the place!

453
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,320
Susu.

454
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,200
Calm down! Calm down!

455
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,770
Calm down! Please calm down, everyone!

456
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,410
What's going on?

457
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,590
Let's talk about it calmly.

458
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,990
The food you distributed

459
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,430
was mixed with half sand!

460
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,520
My mother ate your porridge,
and it chipped her teeth!

461
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,200
Nonsense!

462
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,600
We all drank that porridge!

463
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
Where was there any sand?

464
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,030
Father, I'm about to become

465
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,130
the head of the county militia bureau!

466
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,930
Are you still worried about that, Father?

467
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,990
My brother told me.

468
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,190
He said, "Brother,

469
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
as long as you secure

470
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,310
the position of militia bureau chief,

471
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,680
then with me as police chief
and you as militia bureau chief,

472
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,510
we'll control all security

473
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,310
and protection in the county."

474
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,930
Just think about it, Father.

475
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,200
All the equipment and troop recruitmentâ€”

476
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,300
with just one wave of my hand,

477
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,110
money will pour in, Father.

478
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,530
When that time comes,
it'll be harder not to get rich, Father!

479
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,830
So,

480
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,650
I want to persuade you.

481
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,850
Don't worry so much
about your grain.

482
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,750
For those disaster refugees,

483
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,190
just a small portion of your stored grain

484
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,920
could feed them for three days.

485
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,300
Even if you set up a porridge stand

486
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,850
to feed all the refugees,

487
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,590
you wouldn't lose much grain.

488
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,980
Once I earn money in the future,

489
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,650
I'll make up for

490
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,720
whatever grain you've distributed, Father!

491
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,960
So this is what we call

492
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,780
a "strategic retreat for future gain"!

493
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,190
Just do as I say!

494
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,230
Didn't you read the newspapers?

495
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,180
Three provinces have been affected
by the disaster.

496
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,110
The refugees from any one province

497
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,010
must number over a hundred thousand.

498
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,340
If you really want to help those refugees,

499
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,060
you'd need a mountain of grain.

500
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,640
That little grain in our granaries

501
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,600
wouldn't even be enough
to make them a watery gruel.

502
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,750
Don't be greedy,

503
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,470
and don't push too hard,
or everything will backfire.

504
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,470
A person should never boast too much.

505
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,400
You haven't earned a penny yet,

506
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,660
and already you're bragging to me,

507
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,440
making empty promises!

508
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,510
Let me tell you,

509
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,570
if you can't protect my grain granaries,

510
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,830
I'll have to take back those weapons

511
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,290
I gave you for the militia.

512
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,120
And another thing,

513
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,520
this promotion you wantâ€”

514
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,110
I don't have the money for you

515
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,790
to grease the wheels!

516
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,330
No, no, no, Father, don't say that!

517
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:03,750
Don't, don't, don't say that.

518
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,200
Why are you saying that?

519
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,750
Don't worry. I'll

520
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,350
guard your grain.

521
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,640
I swear!

522
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,320
I'll punish myself by having a drink.
I misspoke.

523
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,120
Calm down! Calm down!

524
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,310
Let's talk about this calmly.

525
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,070
Don't waste words on them. Take the grain!

526
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,440
-Take it!
-Take it!

527
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,420
Xiuxiu, Xiuxiu, Xiuxiu.

528
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,050
Don't take it! Wait!

529
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,060
It's me. It's me!

530
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,510
Dajiao?

531
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,110
You need to leave now! Hurry!

532
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,880
What's going on?

533
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,080
It's too late if you don't go now! Hurry!

534
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,560
Take all the grain!

535
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,540
Take the grain!

536
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,960
Jia!

537
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,550
Take all the grain!

538
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,620
Si, did you see clearly?

539
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,960
No, I didn't.

540
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,640
Come on. Let's go inside and check.

541
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,460
Don't let them escape.

542
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,020
Let's go.

543
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,200
We can't go back to the elementary school.

544
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,090
Tietou, take Xiuxiu and Susu

545
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,600
and hurry home through the shortcut.

546
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,460
What about you?

547
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,270
I can't let the grain
fall into enemy hands.

548
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,590
I'll help Jia and everyone else

549
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,160
move the grain to a safe place.

550
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
You need to go now.

551
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,490
-We're leaving.
-Be careful.

552
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,270
Let's go.

553
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,460
Wendian, be careful.

554
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:10,810
Come on, let's go.

555
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,380
Let's go.

556
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,610
Let's go.

557
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,920
Hurry!

558
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,600
It's terrifying just thinking about it.

559
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,750
Those men were carrying guns.

560
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Why didn't you come back and warn us?

561
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,570
There was no time.

562
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,720
If I'd wasted a moment,
we'd all have been trapped there.

563
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,220
I knew what I was doing.

564
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,790
When the disaster refugees heard
what I said,

565
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,110
they all came to help me.

566
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,460
Didn't you hear what Fei Wendian said?

567
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,720
Even he admires me now.

568
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,720
I'm telling you,

569
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,290
before you try to be a hero again,

570
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,350
think about your son, your mother...

571
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,210
and think about me.

572
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,580
If I think about you first,
I won't get anything done.

573
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,690
Alright, alright, alright.

574
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,550
Next time, I definitely won't be
so impulsive

575
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,950
and won't make you worry.

576
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,610
I'm still thinking about
going to find my brother tomorrow.

577
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,340
Last time, I joined him

578
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,830
in an uprising.

579
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,240
I think this situation is the same as
last time.

580
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,180
I'll go persuade him. I'll go to him.

581
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,450
Don't worry about it.

582
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,540
You've checked all of them?

583
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,310
Not a grain left?

584
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
He's trying to destroy me,

585
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,550
destroy our Fei family.

586
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,090
Sister-in-law!

587
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,170
Sister-in-law!

588
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,610
Sister-in-law!

589
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm not your sister-in-law!

590
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,040
I'm your enemy!

591
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,250
How could you be my enemy?

592
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,300
You're my sister-in-law.

593
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,170
Sister-in-law, I've just done something

594
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,970
that brings honor to our Fei family...

595
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,900
Your idea of honor is to spend
all our family fortune?

596
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,370
When I was little,
I often heard you talk about

597
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,690
helping the weak and doing good deeds.

598
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
Do you believe I'll hit you?

599
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,370
I believe it,

600
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,290
but I believe you won't bear to do it.

601
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:02,720
You...

602
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,860
Sister-in-law!

603
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,140
I came back just to check on you.

604
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,270
Seeing that you still have the strength
to hit me, I'm relieved.

605
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,270
I'll be going now.

606
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,640
You...

607
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,170
How did I raise such a fool?

608
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,220
I need to go kowtow and apologize.

609
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,570
I need to go kowtow and apologize.

610
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,720
Isn't Fei Wendian back to teaching?

611
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,750
Why is he responsible for
handling grain distribution?

612
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,610
And it's Mrs. Fei's grain
that he's been giving out.

613
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,310
Mrs. Fei is also

614
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,830
distributing grain now?

615
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,240
Mr. Ning! Mr. Ning...

616
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,510
Just right, Kejin, you're here too.

617
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,440
Have a seat. Sit.

618
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,330
Look at thisâ€”
I received this letter yesterday.

619
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,150
They want me to voluntarily open
my granaries and distribute grain

620
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,950
within three days,

621
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,230
or they'll force me to do so.

622
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,730
Mr. Ning,

623
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,040
well,

624
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,480
your family has the most surplus grain.

625
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,270
Did you get a letter like this?

626
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,130
Which eye of yours saw that my family has
the most surplus grain?

627
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,930
I might have eaten or sold it all.

628
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,650
That's not what I meant.

629
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,770
Look, I came to you

630
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,070
because I wanted your advice.

631
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,560
W-Will you distribute grain?

632
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,790
If you distribute, I'll distribute.

633
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,710
If you don't,

634
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,820
I won't either.

635
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,330
But when the time comes,

636
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,000
Kejin,

637
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,740
you'll have to protect our homes
and property.

638
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,940
You can't let them loot me, right?

639
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,110
Have you heard?

640
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,510
The disaster refugees have gone crazy now.

641
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,000
They storm the landlords' granariesâ€”

642
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
leaving not a single grain behind.

643
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
Some of them

644
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,520
can't even wait for the food to be cooked

645
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,650
and just eat it raw.

646
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,810
They even eat raw soybeans.

647
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,590
After eating them, they drink some water,

648
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,470
and when the soybeans swell
in their stomachs,

649
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,700
several people have died from bloating!

650
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
It's terrifying.

651
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,600
Kejin,

652
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,680
you...

653
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,440
you need to protect me, alright?

654
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,480
Well, could you

655
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,440
post a couple of your men at my door?

656
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,640
Uncle,

657
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,230
you provide all the rations
for our men in the militia,

658
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,830
so I'll definitely help you
in a time like this.

659
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,780
Thank you, Kejin.

660
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,510
Our family doesn't actually have
much surplus grain,

661
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,900
nothing compared to your family's.

662
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,450
Go home and wait!

663
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,070
This coward.

664
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,700
Listen to him,

665
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,450
he came begging for your protection

666
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,290
and still had to throw a jab at me
on his way out.

667
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,550
Please give me something to eat.

668
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,270
Yu Er.

669
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,920
Post more men at my family's gate

670
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
and arm them well.

671
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,040
If my family loses even a single grain,
I'll hold you accountable.

672
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,570
Kejin, say no more.

673
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,440
Let's go!

674
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,260
Come back.

675
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,240
Station some men on the arcade too,

676
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,460
and pile up stones.

677
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,240
If the disaster refugees try to climb
and seize grain,

678
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
throw stones at them.

679
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,360
They're so starved that
even a gust of wind could blow them away.

680
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,760
So, don't waste your bullets.

681
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Kejin,

682
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,510
what about Li Junyi, Xiong,

683
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,830
and the other landlords in the village?

684
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,790
Should we guard them too?

685
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,090
Just assign a couple of men
as a formality.

686
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,550
The top priority right now is
to protect my family!

687
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,070
Yes.

688
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,450
Dismissed.

689
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,400
You few, come with me.

690
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,920
Kejin!

691
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,250
Someone's here to see you.

692
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,260
My brother-in-law is here!

693
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,780
Kejin.

694
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,840
Come on, come on.

695
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,950
Have a seat.

696
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,510
Kejin.

697
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,090
I've been looking for you for days.

698
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,310
Here.

699
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,830
Have some tea.

700
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,850
You need something?

701
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,550
Kejin,

702
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
I've come...

703
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,180
to ask you to become a hero.

704
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,720
A hero?

705
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,270
I can't be a hero.

706
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:32,840
Kejin!

707
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Listen to me.

708
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,530
I'm here to persuade you

709
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,510
to convince Father
to open granaries and distribute grain

710
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,590
to save the disaster refugees,

711
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,920
and also to persuade you

712
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,230
to lead your troops to help the refugees

713
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,720
fight against those landlords
who refuse to distribute grain

714
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,380
and save the refugees' lives.

715
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,130
I just got back from the county town.

716
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,870
Do you know who's behind those uprisings?

717
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,760
The Communists.

718
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,510
You're not a Communist,

719
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,570
so why do you meddle in this nonsense?

720
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,680
Is it because of that brat, Fei Wendian?

721
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,620
He's been stirring up trouble
since he returned.

722
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,530
Doesn't he know

723
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,960
that there are rewards
for capturing Communists now?

724
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,020
Isn't he afraid of being arrested
by the county police?

725
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,780
Kejin, I think

726
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,750
that no matter who's leading those,

727
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,750
they're all for the disaster refugees.

728
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,880
You must see how the refugees are

729
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,760
suffering and starving, right?

730
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,160
People are starving to death
before us every day,

731
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000
right on our doorstep.

732
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,330
You can't just stand by
and watch them die.

733
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,640
I still remember, years ago,

734
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,840
when you and Mr. Du...

735
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,660
captured the county magistrateâ€”

736
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,960
you led men to raid the county armory

737
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,060
and achieved great merit.
What was that for?

738
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,310
It was to exempt people
from taxes and levies,

739
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,110
letting them keep grain in their bowlsâ€”
that was about saving lives.

740
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,480
I still remember Mr. Du praising you,

741
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,930
saying that you

742
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,070
know how to lead troops and fight battles

743
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,160
and that you have the makings
of a general.

744
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,890
Even my brother-in-law has now learned to
use reverse psychology.

745
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,290
But that won't work on me.

746
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,610
Let me tell you what I was doing
in the county.

747
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,720
I am about to assume my position

748
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,530
as the head of the county militia bureau.

749
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,920
Dajiao,

750
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,600
stop hanging around with Fei Wendian.

751
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,330
I'll look after you from now on.

752
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,220
What do disaster refugees and grain

753
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,250
have to do with me? Just go home now.

754
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,130
Kejin, please listen to my advice.

755
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,890
Go back!

756
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,030
Kejin!

757
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,960
Are you two here
to put on a show together?

758
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,990
Dajiao didn't want me to come.

759
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,720
Kejin,

760
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,250
I need to speak honestly with you.

761
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,610
Do you really think those refugees
have nothing to do with you?

762
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,640
Those are all human lives.

763
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,240
Have you forgotten

764
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,320
how Mother taught us

765
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
and what she did when we were little?

766
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,300
Whenever a beggar came to our door,

767
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,830
Mother would always bring them food.

768
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,540
Do you remember what she said?

769
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,940
-Mother's passed away.
-Mother used to...

770
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,670
I only remember that
when she was dying, she told me

771
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,470
to take care of our father

772
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,410
and look after the family.

773
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,050
I've asked Father
why he won't distribute the grain.

774
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,170
After listening, I think what Father said
makes sense.

775
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,920
You all should stop meddling in this.

776
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,720
I can't help you this time, Xiu.

777
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,510
Just go home now, okay? Go home.

778
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,160
Kejin.

779
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,400
You're just following Father blindly,

780
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,510
with your eyes and heart shut,

781
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,170
stumbling around aimlessly.

782
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,760
You'll drag him to ruin sooner or later.

783
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,680
Let's go.

784
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,040
You're the one
who is ruining him now, Ning Xiuxiu!

785
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,610
How could I have ruined him?

786
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,070
You seriously don't know?

787
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,510
You've always hated him!

788
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,110
You hate him that
after you were kidnapped by bandits,

789
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,850
he didn't pay your ransom, right?

790
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,810
I hate him too!

791
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,210
I've fought with him so many times
over this!

792
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,650
During the New Year,
Lianye and I took the children

793
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,870
and went to her parents' home,

794
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,530
leaving Father all alone at home
without paying attention to him!

795
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,310
Sister.

796
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,890
So many years have passed.

797
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,000
Can't you just let this go?

798
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,950
Can't you forgive our father?

799
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,710
Do you know how many times Father's cried

800
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,310
over this matter since then?

801
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,580
I asked Father

802
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,430
whether we could distribute grain
to the disaster refugees.

803
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,790
And do you know what Father told me?

804
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,790
He said, "We have plenty of grain,

805
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,590
but do you know how many disaster refugees
there are now?

806
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,980
I can't afford it. I can't save them all."

807
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,690
Don't let it come to
the refugees starving to death,

808
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,420
and you, me, and Father
all starving to death too!

809
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,240
What could I say to that, sister?

810
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,610
I think Father is right.

811
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,070
So I can't help you this time.

812
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,720
Go, just go now.

813
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,970
Stop bothering me here.

814
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,530
Kejin!

815
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,700
Xiu didn't mean it that way.

816
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,790
You shouldn't think like that

817
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,120
or talk to her like that.

818
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,920
She hopes you can guide our father

819
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,300
onto the right path.

820
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,670
And what's the "right path"?

821
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,700
Following Fei Wendianâ€”

822
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,090
is that the right path?

823
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,910
The door is right there.

824
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,040
Go follow your right path.

825
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,220
Go follow your right path!

826
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,790
Don't give me all this nonsense.

827
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,940
You're just finding ways to help him
protect that grain.

828
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,210
Whether this is the right thing to do,

829
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,140
you know it very well in your heart.

830
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,730
Let's go. We can't get through to him.

831
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,820
I've just received instructions
from the superiors.

832
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,680
The Kuomintang

833
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,050
is planning to use force

834
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,580
to suppress
our grain distribution efforts.

835
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,790
So our superiors want us

836
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,250
to persuade Ning Xuexiang

837
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,670
to distribute his surplus grain
to the refugees as soon as possible.

838
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,470
I've also reported to superiors

839
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,720
that tomorrow night,

840
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
I'll lead the disaster refugees

841
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,910
to petition at Ning Xuexiang's residence.

842
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,470
I'm still waiting for approval
from the organization.

843
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,970
Mr. Fei, should we

844
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,530
request some weapons
from the organization?

845
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,830
With just these two guns we have,

846
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,960
I'm afraid we can't solve the problem.

847
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,280
On one side are disaster refugees
so hungry they can barely walk,

848
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,530
and on the other side

849
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,120
are our own close ones
from Ox Temple Village.

850
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,929
If there's any accidental discharge,

851
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,260
hurting either side is not our intention.

852
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,710
I will report

853
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,550
our plan this time to the superiors,

854
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,150
and we'll act immediately
once it's approved.

855
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,030
First,

856
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,590
we need to

857
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,159
win over Ning Kejin.

858
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,030
Xiuxiu, let's try to persuade them again.

859
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,440
Don't bother.

860
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,210
Our brother only stands with Father now.

861
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,489
Could we... could we maybe

862
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,690
detain my brother?

863
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,510
If the militia chief himself is
being detained,

864
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,610
his men wouldn't dare to
make any rash moves.

865
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,300
Susu,

866
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,230
you want to kidnap our own brother?

867
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,489
Could you even do that?

868
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,550
It might make Father seriously ill.

869
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,030
That's right, Susu.

870
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,880
This approach really isn't feasible.

871
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,840
Ning Kejin is also someone

872
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,239
whose support we've always wanted to gain.

873
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,800
In that case,

874
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,800
Wendian,

875
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,440
you go find Kejin.

876
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,820
I'll go to Second Uncle
and ask him to persuade Father.

877
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,730
Xiuxiu's idea could work.

878
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,300
Mr. Fei!

879
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,330
Mr. Fei, Li Junyi has voluntarily opened
his granaries to distribute food.

880
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Li Junyi

881
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,360
is quite sharp-minded.

882
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
He's just scared,

883
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,650
fearing that the disaster refugees
might raid the granaries themselves.

884
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,580
Tietou is right.

885
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,880
Jia, Xinming,

886
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,980
we need to refine our plan carefully.

887
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,540
We must ensure
that the grain distribution is

888
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,470
organized, well-planned, and orderly.

889
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,990
Okay.

890
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,390
We've also evacuated

891
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
from the elementary school.

892
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,000
Dajiao,

893
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,040
I haven't had the chance to thank you yet.

894
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,450
If you hadn't warned us in time
during the last distribution,

895
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,050
the consequences would have been
disastrous.

896
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,410
Could I just watch you all get arrested?

897
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,890
From now on,

898
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,560
we all need to be careful.

899
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,320
Wendian, you're the ones
who need to be careful.

900
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,050
Don't worry.

901
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,220
We'll take good care of ourselves.

902
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,610
If any strangers have appeared recently,

903
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,610
try to keep your distance from them.

904
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,550
Father!

905
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,890
Have you heard?

906
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,310
I have.

907
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,860
That coward Li Junyi has opened
his granaries to distribute grain.

908
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,400
He's afraid the disaster refugees
will steal all his grain,

909
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,620
so he puts on a show of generosity.

910
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,960
I just don't understand, Kejin.

911
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,150
By doing this,

912
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,070
does he really think

913
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,240
he can save any of his grain?

914
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,270
He knows nothing.

915
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,210
He's just a coward.

916
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,420
But he must be thinking
that by doing this,

917
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,720
he might save at least some of his grain.

918
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,820
So, I'm thinking, Father,

919
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,970
maybe you should put on a show too.

920
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,760
A show?

921
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
What kind of show?

922
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,730
Do I need to put on a show?

923
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,860
I have you.

924
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,780
You have the militia.

925
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,380
What do I need to pretend for?

926
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,230
Father,

927
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,810
you have no idea.

928
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,250
Now, those refugees have gone crazy,
looting for food.

929
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,100
I'm just worried
that something might go wrong.

930
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,230
Did I waste my money
buying those 20-shot rifles for you?

931
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,420
Are you really that clueless,
or are you just pretending?

932
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,670
Right now, among those refugees
demanding grain

933
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,250
are my two sisters and Dajiao!

934
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,250
Do you want me to point a gun at them?

935
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,240
My foolish boy,

936
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,770
you really are my simple-minded son.

937
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,650
Why don't you understand?

938
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,000
Why am I protecting this grain
so desperately?

939
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,550
It's all for you

940
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,270
and your two sisters.

941
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,660
You have no idea what this famine means.

942
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't want

943
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,960
my children and grandchildren,

944
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,920
Ning Xuexiang's descendants,

945
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,080
to go hungry

946
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,210
and be forced to beg for food.

947
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,360
You truly don't understand my intentions?

948
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,880
At a time like this,

949
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,780
by raising your gun,

950
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,290
you're actually protecting our family.

951
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,730
You need to be on the same side as me!

952
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,630
Didn't we ask Second Uncle to talk to him?

953
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,590
Why do we still need to go?

954
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,110
I don't feel at ease.

955
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,760
Let's go wait for Second Uncle,

956
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,860
and after he's done talking,

957
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,260
we'll take him back home.

958
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,670
Wendian?

959
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,290
Why are you here?

960
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,690
Look.

961
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:43,660
Hurry!

962
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,130
My brother is trying to
move the grain somewhere else.

963
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,620
I went to the militia hall
to find Ning Kejin today,

964
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,230
but found no one there.

965
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,170
I suspect they're planning something,

966
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,620
so I came here to check.

967
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,900
We need to find a way
to stop those trucks.

968
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,710
Dajiao,

969
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,350
let's go find Tietou

970
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,880
and gather the refugees
on the mountain path outside the village.

971
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,470
Xiuxiu,

972
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,060
you need to stay here

973
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,200
and find a way to stall them.

974
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,360
Stall them as long as possible

975
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,250
to give us time to organize the people.

976
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,390
Also, remind your brother

977
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,190
not to harm any innocent people.

978
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,110
Okay.

979
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,110
Let's go.

980
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,030
Brother,

981
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,220
they're stirring up trouble.

982
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,080
You shouldn't get involved in it.

983
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,510
What blessing?

984
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,880
What good karma?

985
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,210
Keeping the grain

986
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,030
to feed the children is a real blessing.

987
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,990
You're good in every way,
except that you're too easily persuaded.

988
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,390
Did Xiuxiu send you here?

989
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:51,960
Brother,

990
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,480
ever since these refugees started coming,

991
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,440
I haven't had any peace of mind.

992
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,520
The land is barren,
and the people are suffering.

993
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,310
I just don't have the power.

994
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,360
If I had the power...

995
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,690
Enough, enough. Stop with the empty talk.

996
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,130
Kejin has almost finished loading.

997
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,740
Hurry!

998
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,980
Let's go back. Have a drink

999
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,120
and chat with me.

1000
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,300
Father.

1001
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,450
All loaded.

1002
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,880
All loaded.

1003
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,540
All loaded?

1004
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,280
Go, go, go.

1005
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,420
Stop!

1006
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,520
Ning Xiuxiu!

1007
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,290
Are you out of your mind?

1008
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,320
Ning Kejin!

1009
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,700
Unload the grain now!

1010
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,920
You've really lost your mind.

1011
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,670
It's one thing not to help Father,

1012
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,800
but now you're even daring to
block the trucks!

1013
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
If disaster refugees riot

1014
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,090
and storm into your home,

1015
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,030
you won't even have time to regret it.

1016
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,430
Do you even know
what this grain is used for?

1017
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,600
It's the military supply requisitioned
by the Nationalist Government!

1018
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,580
Blocking the trucks is a capital offense!

1019
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,180
I don't have time for this nonsense.

1020
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,740
Kejin,

1021
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,100
why not listen to your sister's advice?

1022
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,730
What if we encounter rioting refugees
on the road?

1023
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,810
Both people and grain would be lost.

1024
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,670
Second Uncle.

1025
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,370
Do you know what kind of truck this is?

1026
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,880
It's from the county police station.

1027
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,190
They're all armed with guns.

1028
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,890
Why should I fear those refugees?

1029
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,950
Young Master Ning,

1030
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,190
when we came, our Chief Shizheng said

1031
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,720
that we are here only to lend a hand.

1032
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,450
We can't actually kill anyone.

1033
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,630
Ning Xiuxiu,

1034
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,860
will you ever stop?

1035
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,380
Father,

1036
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,620
get her out of here.

1037
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,960
Xiuxiu.

1038
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,730
Can't you stop

1039
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,060
making your father suffer like this?

1040
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,060
Those refugees are dying
right in front of you,

1041
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,660
and you can just ignore them?

1042
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,710
I'm trying to help you,
don't you understand?

1043
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,610
If you don't let Father
move the grain away,

1044
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,000
then the refugees will come
and seize it by force.

1045
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,480
Are you helping Father,

1046
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,630
or are you helping the refugees instead?

1047
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,110
I'm helping youâ€”

1048
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,320
keeping you on the right path

1049
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,640
and from going against the refugees,

1050
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,010
so you can live the rest of your life!

1051
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,160
Xuerui, did you hear that?

1052
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Xiuxiu was just born with a clever tongue,

1053
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,290
just to go against me.

1054
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,200
Xuexiang.

1055
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,120
Everything Xiuxiu says makes sense.

1056
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,840
See? What I'm saying makes sense.

1057
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,890
Sense, my foot! What sense?

1058
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,050
Complete nonsense!

1059
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,120
Kejin, I can't handle her.

1060
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,030
What?

1061
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,660
Are you going to hit me?

1062
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,520
Let go of me! Ning Kejin!

1063
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,590
Quick, hold her!

1064
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,880
Let go of me, Ning Kejin!

1065
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,460
Let go of me!

1066
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:47,980
Hurry!

1067
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,920
Kuangzi, you...

1068
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,630
Drive!

1069
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,110
Kejin!

1070
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,860
Ning Kejin!

1071
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:53,460
Kejin!

1072
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,670
Second Uncle, stop him!

1073
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,360
Ms. Xiuxiu!

1074
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,320
Don't make things difficult for me!

1075
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Ning Kejin!

1076
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,550
Let her chase.

1077
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,780
Let her chase.

1078
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,340
Ning Kejin!

1079
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,160
Stop the truck, Ning Kejin!

1080
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,700
Ning Kejin!
