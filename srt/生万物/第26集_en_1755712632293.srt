[Episode 26]

3
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,039
Tietou?

4
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,840
Tietou!

5
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,370
Tietou?

6
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,150
Tietou!

7
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,400
Tietou!

8
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,280
Tietou?

9
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,050
Tietou!

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Stop right there!

11
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,680
Tietou!

12
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,000
Where are you going?

13
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,000
Where can I go?

14
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,910
I can't stay in this village anymore,

15
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,910
nor in my home.

16
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,750
I can earn a living anywhere.

17
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,750
I'll go work as a farmhand
for some other landlord.

18
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,079
I won't put up with
this humiliation anymore!

19
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,680
Tietou!

20
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,840
If you just leave like this,

21
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,570
there will be even more gossip.

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,210
They can twist the truth
in any way they want.

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
Then what should I do?

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,030
Every time I go home,

25
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,840
Silly Tiao

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,190
pesters me for food and drink!

27
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,079
In my own home!

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
And Silly Tiao is pregnant,

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,330
and nobody knows who the father is!

30
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,820
Look at how her parents are actingâ€”

31
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,680
they're trying to pin it all on me!

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,110
My mother threatens to hang herself
whenever she sees me.

33
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,170
Is that even a home?

34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,110
How can I stay?

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,590
Tietou,

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,220
if you leave like this,

37
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,120
only Silly Tiao and your mother will be
left at home,

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
and your mother might really hang herself.

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Besides,

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,900
what about Yinzi if you leave?

41
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,079
Don't you want to marry her anymore?

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,680
With all this trouble,

43
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,430
what can I do?

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
I don't want to drag Yinzi into this.

45
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,310
She already has a hard life.

46
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,070
I don't want her to worry about me.

47
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,079
Xiuxiu came with me just to talk to you
about this.

48
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,560
Look at you, so spineless.

49
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,360
Is it really that big a deal
that you'd run away?

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,420
Dajiao, you didn't have to face this!

51
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,680
Tietou,

52
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,020
let me tell you,

53
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,400
the best way to prove you didn't do it

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
is

55
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,120
to marry Yinzi.

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
Yinzi trusts you.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,910
Even if Silly Tiao's parents

58
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,590
want to continue blaming you,

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,330
they can't withstand
the neighbors' gossip.

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,680
Get up!

61
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,260
If you're innocent,
you have nothing to fear.

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,269
Even though Silly Tiao is
staying at your house,

63
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,200
don't be afraid.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,420
Give her food and take care of her.

65
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,430
And when the baby is born,

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,830
whoever it looks like will be the father.

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,890
They can't deny it.

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,270
What?

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
What if the baby doesn't look like any man

70
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,040
and only looks like Silly Tiao?

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,950
Then would I have to
support them for life?

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,390
What Dajiao means is,

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
if you didn't do it,

74
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,770
you don't need to run away.

75
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,290
The calmer you are,

76
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,920
the more others will believe
that you've been wrongly accused.

77
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
Go home quickly

78
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,240
and talk things over with your mother.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,500
Marrying Yinzi is what's important now.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Xiuxiu

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,700
knows you're short on money.

82
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,830
Use these three silver dollars first.

83
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,130
Get the wedding preparations started.

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,560
Can you act like a man? Come back with us!

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,630
My old lady, why are you doing this?

86
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,530
What about our kids if you die?

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,470
I don't want to live anymore.

88
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,870
Mother?

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,790
Yinzi, where have you been?

90
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,200
Your mother is trying to kill herself.

91
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,170
This life...

92
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,050
I don't want to be a burden to you all.

93
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,570
My daughter, my daughter!

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,210
I don't want to drag you down.

95
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,230
Mother, don't do anything foolish.

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
I'll save you.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll save you, Mother!

98
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,310
I'll save you!

99
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,040
My daughter!

100
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,800
Mother!

101
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,510
I'm here!

102
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I'm here.

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,800
My daughter!

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,720
Mother!

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,560
How can we go on like this?

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Guess what?

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Last night, Yinzi's mother tried to
kill herself.

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,950
She actually tried to kill herself?

109
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,310
She almost died.

110
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,210
Poor Yinzi and her young siblings were

111
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,390
crying so terribly

112
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,390
that I didn't even dare to
go check on them.

113
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,720
Luckily, she survived.

114
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,870
Exactly.

115
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,430
Here she comes.

116
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,720
Who's coming?

117
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,270
Yinzi, where are you going?

118
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,960
What's she doing here?

119
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,330
She's going to borrow money

120
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,580
from Miser Ning on behalf of her father.

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,130
Again?

122
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,800
Yeah.

123
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,750
But fall is still several months away.

124
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,880
-How will they ever pay it back?
-Yeah.

125
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,220
Mother,

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
say something.

127
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,190
What should I say?

128
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,350
What do you want me to say?

129
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,800
It's not fall yet,

130
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,310
and we have no extra grain to sell.

131
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,280
What do you want me to scrape together
so you can marry Yinzi?

132
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,290
Mother.

133
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,920
So, you agree to let me marry Yinzi?

134
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,560
Can you guarantee
that once you marry Yinzi,

135
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,630
Silly Tiao's parents will take her back?

136
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,430
I can't say for sure
whether they'll take her back.

137
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,430
But Xiuxiu said

138
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,070
that as long as Yinzi trusts me

139
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,270
and stands by my side,

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,659
once we're married

141
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,040
the neighbors' gossip

142
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,159
will shame Silly Tiao's parents into
backing down.

143
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,560
By then, they won't be able to
pin this blame on me anymore,

144
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,600
and whether they want to or not,
they'll have to take Silly Tiao back.

145
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,310
-Go!
-Go away!

146
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,720
Go play somewhere else!

No matter what,

150
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,790
bringing Yinzi here as your wife

151
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,120
is better than having her
stay at our home.

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll go borrow money for you right away.

153
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,980
What a mess.

154
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,750
What a mess.

155
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,580

156
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm going to marry Yinzi.

I-I don't want to braid your hair anymore!

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,510
Go away! Cut it out!

161

Tietou, braid my hair.

162
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,660
Leave me alone.

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,450
They definitely need to borrow money.

164
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,470
She's out.

165
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,470

What's inside your basket?

Nothing much.

Don't be so nosy.

173
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,940
Curiosity only leads to trouble.

174
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,790
What's with that look?

175
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,780
-She's scaring me.
-Yeah.

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,870
to feed my whole family for half a month.

189
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,540
Have Kuangzi deliver them
every half month.

190
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,320
I also want 20 silver dollars
to buy medicine for my mother.

191
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,600
I need money for
as long as my mother needs it,

192
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,790
until she recovers.

193
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,540
I also want to send my brother and sisters
to school.

194
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,000
I also want...

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,130
Don't be too greedy.

196
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,790
I haven't asked

197
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,130
what you can give me in return yet.

198
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,230
Should we go?

199
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:00,920
Let's go.

200
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,130
I-I'll carry it in for you.

201
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,900
No need.

202
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,410
I can carry it in myself.

203
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,600
It's heavy.

204
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,060
I-I'll carry it up for you.

205
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,420
I said, no need!

206
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,210
Hold on, hold on, listen,

207
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,030
it's good stuff.

208
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,970
We can't eat it all in one day.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,260
We need to save some. Save some for later.

210
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,200
Mother?

211
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,240
Eat.

212
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,950
Daughter,

213
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,150
where did you get the money?

214
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,080
If you don't tell me clearly,

215
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,240
I can't eat it.

216
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,200
Mother,

217
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I got it honestly.

218
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,720
Just eat it without worry.

219
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,980
No one will come knocking to take it back.

220
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,020
Wanna something to drink?

221
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,630
Eat slowly.

222
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,240
After I finish brewing Mother's medicine,

223
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,440
I'll make you all a pot of cornmeal soup.

224
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,510
Let me tell you,

225
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,150
this goes perfectly

226
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
with that cornmeal soup.

227
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,270
That's wonderful! That's wonderful!

228
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,000
It's so good.

229
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
It's so good, so good.

230
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,030
Tietou,

231
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,280
what's gotten into you now?

232
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,240
Dajiao, Xiuxiu,

233
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,790
my mother's gone to borrow  money for me.

234
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,920
Your mother agreed?

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,800
That's great.

236
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,290
Have you told Yinzi yet?

237
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,200
Not yet.

238
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,310
I'm thinking,

239
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,750
once my mother brings back the money,

240
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,800
I'll send the matchmaker to her family
to propose!

241
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,930
Give her a surprise.

242
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,150
Give Yinzi a surprise.

243
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,970
What about Silly Tiao? Have you clarified
things with Yinzi about her?

244
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,880
Not yet.

245
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,250
A-After I finish fixing the wall,

246
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,340
I'll go talk to Yinzi right away.

247
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,390
Later,

248
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,740
I'll also help explain things
to Yinzi for you.

249
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,720
Thank you, Xiuxiu.

250
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,270
Alright, hurry up and go.

251
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,120
You can't fix it properly
with your mind so distracted.

252
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,320
I'll finish the rest.

253
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Okay, Dajiao.

254
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,750
I'm going to find Yinzi then.

255
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,130
Xiuxiu!

256
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,080
-Are you okay?
-Oh my goodness.

257
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,850
Are you alright?

258
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,550
Are you okay, Xiuxiu?

259
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,840
How's the baby?

260
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,960
My goodness, how are you feeling?

261
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,270
Are you alright?

262
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,050
I'm fine, really.

263
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,870
-Look what you've done!
-Help her get inside!

264
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,550
Hurry and get her inside.

265
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,150
Let's go inside and lie down on the bed.

266
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,080
Still laughing?

267
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,210
You troublemaker!

268
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,910
If you keep doing this,

269
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,440
I'll cut your braid right off!

270
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,770
Go play somewhere else!

271
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,080
Yinzi.

272
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,320
I went to your house looking for you.

273
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,250
Your sister said

274
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,560
that you came here looking for me.

275
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,500
You didn't do that.

276
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,120
Why have you been avoiding me
these past few days?

277
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,670
I've been dying of frustration.

278
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,630
I was hoping

279
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,960
to clarify everything

280
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
before coming to see you.

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
I can't drag you down with me.

282
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,870
I don't want you to suffer because of me.

283
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,720
What's false can't become true.

284
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,490
I brought you some treats.

285
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,450
I don't care what others say.

286
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,670
I believe you.

287
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,880
Yinzi,

288
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
your trust matters more than

289
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,620
the trust of the whole village combined.

290
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,860
With your trust,

291
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,650
I can endure anything!

292
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,600
Silly you.

293
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,940
You're the one I trust most
in the whole village.

294
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,900
You've never deceived me
since we were children.

295
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,720
You've always helped meâ€”

296
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,430
helped me farm,

297
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,240
helped me take care of
my younger siblings,

298
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,050
and even helped me sneak grain from home.

299
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,750
Sometimes, when life was so hard

300
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,320
that I could barely get by,

301
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,120
I would think

302
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
that I still have you.

303
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,260
With you, no matter how hard life was,

304
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,030
I felt I could get through it.

305
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,790
Yinzi.

306
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,350
I'll never let you live a hard life again.

307
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,010
My mother has gone to borrow money.

308
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,510
Once everything is ready in a few days,

309
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,630
I'll have the matchmaker go to your family
to propose marriage.

310
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,470
I promise I'll give you a good life.

311
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,070
I promise!

312
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,510
I believe you.

313
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,890
I believe you.

314
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,810
I, Fei Yinzi...

315
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,050
will belong to you sooner or later.

316
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,030
Silly boy,

317
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,920
why don't you ask me

318
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,230
where my family got so much cornmeal

319
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,660
to make such fluffy steamed corn buns?

320
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,440
From now on, we'll have to

321
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,290
prepare our meals separately.

322
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,590
You, I, and Dajiao will have
the thin porridge,

323
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,760
and let Xiuxiu have the solid food.

324
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,360
We'll prepare it and take it to her room

325
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,550
so she can eat alone.

326
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,920
That way,

327
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,120
she won't nag us when she sees us
eating thin porridge.

328
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,730
We need to save our grain.

329
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,880
There are so many disaster victims
out there.

330
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,880
As the old saying goes,

331
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,070
"When there's food in the house,

332
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,330
the heart is at peace."

333
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,690
This year's weather is killing us.

334
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,640
It just won't rain.

335
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,790
Father! Mother!

336
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,250
Let's eat. Come on.

337
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Dajiao, food's ready!

338
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,590
Xiuxiu.

339
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,310
On Turtle Hill, we've planted sorghum
and millet.

340
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,440
Here's what we'll do:

341
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,590
starting next year,

342
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,350
we'll plant whatever you think is best.

343
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,810
Let's farm it well.

344
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,740
Alright, then.

345
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,880
I'll think about it carefully.

346
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,750
I'll discuss what to plant next year

347
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,030
with you in advance.

348
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,230
That's wonderful.

349
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,100
We discuss everything together,

350
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,680
and our household
will continue to prosper.

351
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,280
Let's eat.

352
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,810
Father, Mother.

353
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,540
I'll go to the main field later

354
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,570
to water the fruit trees and millet.

355
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,160
It's too dry.

356
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,710
We can't wait for rain anymore.

357
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,340
You don't need to go. Rest at home.

358
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,490
That won't do.

359
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,200
There's lots of work at Turtle Hill.

360
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,930
I'll go with you.

361
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,870
You can't.

362
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,500
Carrying water for irrigation is
hard work.

363
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,510
Don't go with him.

364
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,640
I won't let her work.

365
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,820
She'll just keep me company there.

366
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,980
Alright, alright.

367
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,110
Take good care of her, you hear?

368
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,390
Take that mat with you.

369
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,740
The ground is damp.

370
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,060
I'm not that delicate.

371
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
My grandson is delicate.

372
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,200
Then I'll take good care of your grandson.

373
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,590
Be good.

374
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,680
Eat up.

375
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,110
Eat up, Father.

376
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,830
Take it. Be careful on your way back.

377
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,870
Okay, okay.

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,720
Oh my goodness! Matchmaker!

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,160
Look at all of this!

380
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,410
Which family are you working for
this time?

381
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,200
Which family's daughter is so fortunate?

382
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,980
The betrothal gifts are piled up
like a mountain.

383
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,780
Don't be so nosy.
Curiosity only leads to trouble.

384
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,440
All these bags... are they all grain?

385
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,910
Don't touch it!

386
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,800
No, I'm just looking.

387
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,130
Don't touch it! Go away!

388
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,270
Well,

389
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,830
after all this work,

390
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,400
can you drink and feast again?

391
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
That would be a good life!

392
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,110
Well, each has its own way to get by.

393
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,780
I earn my keep with a clever tongue
and busy feet.

394
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,070
I make my living from happy occasionsâ€”
weddings, betrothals, taking concubines,

395
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,270
bringing in new wivesâ€”all the celebrations
that bring prosperity and joy!

396
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,440
I'm no match for others,

397
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,900
but my life's definitely easier
than yours.

398
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,880
Humpback Guo, don't be so envious!

399
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,290
For crying out loud.

400
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,400
All those fancy words about weddings.

401
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,210
Don't I know you well enough?

402
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,370
You'd take any dirty money you can get.

403
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,600
Shameless.

404
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,820
But speaking of that,

405
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,510
to which family are they
proposing marriage?

406
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,490
Quite a spectacle.

407
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,890
In these years of famine,

408
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,110
to offer so much extra grain
as betrothal gifts.

409
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,830
A landlord.

410
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,770
The groom must be a landlord.

411
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,070
But...

412
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,370
he shouldn't be from our village, right?

413
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,720
You come here every day

414
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,940
but never buy anythingâ€”

415
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,640
just feasting your eyes.

416
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,400
And you have the mood to try to figure out
which village they're from?

417
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,160
But seriously, which village?

418
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,940
I'll go take a look.

419
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,640
Humpback Guo, I'd like to trade for
some salt too.

420
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,400
This little stuff won't even get you
two ounces.

421
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,060
Come back next time!

422
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,520
Miser Ning is really spending big
this time.

423
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,460
Come on, come on!

424
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,200
Hurry up, carry the Ning family's
betrothal gifts

425
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,640
in the courtyard!

426
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,550
You'll get paid once you're done!

427
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,130
Quick, get moving!

428
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:46,920
New goods came in again?

429
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,380
Matchmaker. Matchmaker!

430
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,400
Whose marriage are you arranging?

431
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,320
We're already at their doorstep.
Do you still need to ask?

432
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,150
Hurry up! Hurry!

433
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,780
Yinzi?

434
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,070
You tell me,

435
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,310
how old is that old jerk?

436
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,640
He must be ancient.

437
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,640
He's even older than Glutton Fei.

438
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,210
And he's marrying his daughter Yinzi?

439
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,450
He has no shame at all!

440
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,900
Enough, watch your mouth.

441
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm not his tenant.
What do I have to fear?

442
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,450
What brings you here today

443
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,760
to honor us with your presence?

444
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,780
Have some water.

445
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,430
I'm not thirsty yet.

446
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,840
Mr. Fei, Mrs. Fei.

447
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,410
I've come today

448
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,310
to bring you good news.

449
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,920
Yinzi!

450
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,000
Girl,

451
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,510
do you want to say it, or should I?

452
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,240
Come on,

453
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,310
come gather locust flowers with me.

454
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,510
She is shy.

455
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,000
Then I'll tell you.

456
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,790
I've come today

457
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,690
to arrange a marriage
for your daughter, Yinzi.

458
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,680
If you ask me,

459
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,210
you two must have done

460
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,170
some great deeds in your past lives

461
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,590
to be blessed with
such a good daughter as Yinzi.

462
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,750
When one person achieves something,
the whole family benefits.

463
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,510
You two are truly blessed.

464
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,880
Ning Xuexiang, the richest landlord
in Ox Temple Village,

465
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,240
has taken a liking to your Yinzi!

466
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,400
Who?

467
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,830
Ning... Ning...

468
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,160
Ning Xuexiang.

469
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,550
Ning Xuexiang?

470
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,530
Oh my goodness.

471
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,030
He is so old.

472
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,230
His...

473
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,240
his daughter Xiuxiu is even older
than our Yinzi.

474
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,240
He's old enough to be Yinzi's father!

475
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,210
This match won't do, won't do at all.

476
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,540
I-I can't agree to this.

477
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,270
Listen, Yinzi's mom,

478
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,900
your words aren't fair.

479
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,480
An older man marrying a young girl
happens every day.

480
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,070
Besides,

481
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,240
he's not asking your daughter
to be his concubine.

482
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,550
His wife passed away,

483
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,590
so Yinzi would marry
as his new legitimate wife,

484
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,010
the one who holds the keys to the granary.

485
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,920
By then, your whole family would be

486
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,650
living in comfort,
with plenty of food and drink.

487
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,940
No, no, no.

488
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,480
They're really not a good match!

489
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,740
Wouldn't I be selling my daughter?

490
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,790
Besides,

491
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,160
everyone in the village knows
that Tietou and my Yinzi are in love.

492
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,090
When fall comes,

493
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,400
Tietou will marry our Yinzi.

494
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,640
Fall?

495
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,550
Even if it's next fall or the fall after,

496
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,850
I doubt Tietou will ever be able to
marry your daughter.

497
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,070
Yinzi's mom, stop being so stubborn.

498
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,540
Good fortune is right at your doorstep,

499
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,220
so I'll pretend I didn't hear
what you just said.

500
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,240
Her dad...

501
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,210
Her dad, say something.

502
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,260
Say something!

503
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,590
Yinzi's mom,

504
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,030
stop pounding on your bed.

505
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,840
Originally, I didn't want to say this.

506
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,590
You're in poor health right now,

507
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,520
and you shouldn't get so worked up.

508
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,280
You're still counting on Tietou?

509
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,310
I don't think there's any hope there.

510
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,440
You don't know yet, huh?

511
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,310
Tietou

512
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,640
knocked Silly Tiao up.

513
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,630
She's already seven or eight months along.

514
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,470
Silly Tiao's parents

515
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,110
basically shoved her onto Tietou's bed.

516
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,140
And Yinzi is still waiting to marry him?

517
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,450
Marry him for what?

518
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,900
To become a concubine?

519
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,930
Silly Tiao is the wife,
and Yinzi is the concubine?

520
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,790
Both of them rolling around
on Tietou's shabby bed?

521
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,690
Don't blame me for speaking bluntly.

522
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,120
Sending your daughter to live
that kind of life?

523
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,050
I can't even bear to think about it.

524
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,700
How can you be so heartless as a mother?

525
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,600
Why is my daughter's fate so harsh?

526
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,900
No, I won't let my daughter marry him.

527
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,000
If she must, I'll have her by my side
all her life.

528
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,960
I won't marry her off. I won't.

529
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,790
Even if Ning Xuexiang has
mountains of gold and silver,

530
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,880
I still won't let my daughter marry him.

531
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,200
I won't agree to this.

532
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,350
Alright.

533
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
Yinzi's mom,

534
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,750
stop wailing.

535
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,640
Anyway, today I've said

536
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,570
everything that needed to be said.

537
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,790
And you

538
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,110
don't need to put up a front anymore.

539
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,400
There's one more thing

540
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,070
I need to tell you.

541
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,270
Your Yinzi

542
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,570
went to him herself.

543
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,740
Many people saw it.

544
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,220
Master Ning sent me to propose marriage,

545
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,570
and that's only because

546
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,170
he wants to
preserve your daughter's dignity.

547
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,030
The betrothal gifts are right at the door.

548
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,590
I'll ask them to carry the gifts in.

549
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,400
We've even had their birth dates checked.
It's a good match.

550
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,130
They've even chosen the date
for the engagement.

551
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,980
So, you'd better start preparing.

552
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,440
Mr. and Mrs. Fei,

553
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,010
good fortune is coming to your family!

554
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,070
Congratulations!

555
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,630
Humpback Guo?

556
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,550
Humpback Guo!

557
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,680
-Ms. Susu.
-You said you'd be selling goods

558
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,820
at the Fei Residence's entrance.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

559
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,480
Did you bring my scented soap?

560
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,350
Scented soap?

561
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,550
I've used it.

562
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,740
Only this little bit of it is left.

563
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,210
Just kidding! Just kidding!

564
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,880
I was just teasing you.

565
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,980
Why lie if you brought it?

566
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,780
I did bring it.

567
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,060
Here it is.

568
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,550
Smells nice, right?

569
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,410
Put it on my tab.

570
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,370
Hold on, hold on.

571
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,510
Ms. Susu,

572
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,380
I wanted to tell you last timeâ€”

573
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,400
how about

574
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,050
we go back to the old way,

575
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,880
settling each purchase on the spot?

576
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,550
I used to pay on the spot,

577
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,260
but you suggested that I run a tab
and settle up at year's endâ€”

578
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,960
you said it'd save me the hassle
of handling money each time.

579
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,020
So what's changed?

580
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,830
Oh, I get it now!

581
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,720
You put me on credit to keep me hooked,

582
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,820
to make sure I'd keep coming back
to buy from you!

583
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,720
Why change back to paying on the spot now?

584
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,850
I didn't bring any money with me today.

585
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,740
You've seen right through
my little scheme.

586
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,240
I'm really short on cash lately,

587
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,710
so I was thinking of collecting some debts

588
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,110
to restock my inventory.

589
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,840
Well, I have no money on me today.

590
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,240
I'll ask my sister-in-law for some
and pay you later.

591
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,660
Let's not wait until later.

592
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,070
Today seems like a good time.

593
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,640
We're close to your parents' home,

594
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,830
and your father is preparing for
a wedding.

595
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,280
Just sweet-talk him a little,

596
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,750
and you'll get the money, won't you?

597
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,310
No way my father would give me money.

598
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,200
I'll have to ask my sister-in-law...

599
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,400
What did you just say?

600
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,620
My father's preparing for a wedding?

601
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,450
What wedding?

602
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,970
Don't play dumb.

603
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,050
Isn't your father marrying Yinzi?

604
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,650
Your brother has already started
making arrangements

605
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,960
and has even ordered red silk from me.

606
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,890
Yet you're pretending not to know?

607
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
The water's boiling.

608
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,290
Look,

609
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,180
once the water is boiling,

610
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
you put these...

611
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,650
locust flowers wrapped in cornmeal
into the pot.

612
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,640
Be careful not to burn yourself.

613
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,030
Okay.

614
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,800
The rim of the pot is very hot.

615
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,160
Put the lid on.

616
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,350
Remember,

617
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,750
when the water is almost boiling,
pull some firewood out.

618
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,480
That way, we'll save firewood.

619
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,220
When the buns are done,

620
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,090
give me a piece.

621
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,590
See that?

622
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,400
That's how it's done,

623
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,800
pulling out the firewood
at the right time.

624
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,530
I heard that Miser Ning...

625
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,730
Watch your hand. Watch your hand!

626
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,660
That Miser Ning.

627
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,650
Miser Ning is so old,

628
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,700
and he wants to marry a young girl.

629
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,200
That Miser Ning

630
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,350
is robbing the cradle.

631
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,900
He's rich, and if he wants more women,
that's his business.

632
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,960
Why are you all so concerned about it?

633
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,390
He just wants to marry a new wife.

634
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,720
Xiu.

635
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,650
Here, fresh out of the pot.
Eat while they're hot.

636
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,250
Mother, I'm not hungry.

637
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Eat. Eat.

638
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,110
Let's share.

639
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,000
You think these are for you?

640
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,080
They are for your grandson, right?

641
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,850
Grandma made them for you. Eat more.

642
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,680
Eat.

643
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,510
Eat.

644
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,270
Then, let's eat together.

645
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,030
Eat up.

646
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,450
Eat more so the baby grows strong.

647
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,640
Xiuxiu!

648
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,790
Xiuxiu!

649
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,510
Xiuxiu.

650
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,440
Susu, have some.

651
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,000
Xiuxiu,

652
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,240
have you heard?

653
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,350
Father, that shameless old man,

654
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,680
wants to marry Yinzi!

655
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:26,920
What?

656
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,560
Yinzi and I just...

657
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,510
Stop smashing things!
Stop smashing things!

658
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,400
What's Tietou doing?

659
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,090
Let's go take a look.

660
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,220
It's all your fault!

661
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,140
All your fault!

662
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,790
Stop smashing things! Please stop!

663
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,920
It's all your fault!

664
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,030
All your fault!

665
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,790
If you hadn't been stopping me every day,

666
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,790
I would have married Yinzi long ago!

667
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,270
Then none of this would have happened!

668
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,000
I also went to borrow money for you!

669
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,030
I wanted the matchmaker
to propose for you,

670
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,310
but who knew she cared only about money?

671
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,900
She doesn't care only about money!

672
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,660
My son,

673
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,200
she can marry whoever she wants.

674
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,070
Mother will find you

675
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,720
another good girl
from a nice family, okay?

676
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Let's stop smashing things, okay?

677
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,350
Tietou!

678
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,000
She'll marry whoever she wants!

679
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,450
What does that have to do with me?

680
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
What's going on?

681
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,070
See? You see now?

682
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,400
We wanted to marry her,

683
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,640
but she never even thought about
marrying into our family!

684
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,510
All my effort was for nothing!

685
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,110
Mother, we'll go see what's going on.

686
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,840
Please look after Auntie here.

687
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,370
Susu, take good care of your sister!

688
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,130
Be careful!

689
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,680
I will!

690
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,130
I can't live like this anymore!

691
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,590
I can't live like this!

692
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,640
Yinzi!

693
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,390
Yinzi, open the door!

694
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,400
Yinzi, open the door!

695
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,440
Open up, Yinzi!

696
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,260
Braid my hair. Tietou, braid my hair.

697
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,580
Get off me!

698
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,920
It's all because of you!

699
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,820
If you want to leech,
go leech off someone else!

700
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,900
Leave me alone! I'm begging you!

701
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,060
Why are you yelling? She's just a fool.

702
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,970
Are you okay?

703
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,600
Yinzi.

704
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,230
Yinzi!

705
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:51,910
Seriously.

706
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,310
Yinzi, open the door, Yinzi!

707
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,790
Yinzi!

708
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,690
If you don't open the door,

709
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,750
I'll break it down!

710
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,410
Go back.

711
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,830
Don't come looking for me again.

712
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,160
Why?

713
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,200
Why...

714
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,440
why are you marrying him?

715
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,550
What did I do?

716
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,450
What did I do wrong?

717
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,640
You...

718
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,770
If you break my door,

719
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,170
I'll make the Fei family pay for it.

720
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,580
What are you trying to do?

721
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,150
Have you no shame?

722
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,720
I'm embarrassed to even say it.

723
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,690
Why are you marrying Yinzi?
Don't you know how old she is?

724
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,550
How dare you speak to me like that?

725
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,670
Who has no shame?

726
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,840
You came here cursing me
without even asking what had happened.

727
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,270
Let me tell you,

728
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,650
Yinzi came to me herself.

729
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,040
She sought me out.

730
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,000
If I had refused,

731
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,780
she would've killed herself.

732
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,900
Could I let her die?

733
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,920
I had to save her.

734
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,590
I didn't just save her.

735
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,000
I saved her whole family.

736
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,270
For this,

737
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,460
I deserve a place
in their Fei family's ancestral hall.

738
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
You think I'm just

739
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
marrying her and that's it?

740
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,290
There are so many mouths to feed
in her family.

741
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,830
Because of this,

742
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,770
you have no idea
how difficult it's been for me.

743
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,360
Was it really Yinzi who came to beg you?

744
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,960
Would I lie to you about this?

745
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,330
So many people saw it.

746
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,389
Kuangzi saw it too.

747
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,440
I couldn't just crush
a little girl's pride, could I?

748
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,880
Father is remarrying,
not taking a concubine.

749
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,150
What am I supposed to say?

750
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,030
Why can't he remarry someone else?

751
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,400
Why does he have to ruin Yinzi
by marrying her?

752
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,460
How can you say that it's ruining her?

753
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,040
She proposed it!

754
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,840
Besides, she has to marry someone,
doesn't she?

755
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,030
She should consider herself lucky

756
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,400
to marry into our family!

757
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,800
You...

758
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,400
What?

759
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,929
Let alone remarrying,

760
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,840
even if he took a concubine,
we wouldn't be able to stop him.

761
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,070
Which wealthy man

762
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,820
doesn't have many concubines?

763
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,760
It's been so long since Mom passed away,

764
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,670
and Father hasn't taken even one woman.

765
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,440
For that alone, I even admire him.

766
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,320
You... listen to yourself.

767
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,420
Is that what a decent person would say?

768
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,989
If that's not decent, then what is?

769
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,650
Besides...

770
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,800
it's a good thing that Yinzi is young.

771
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,080
After she marries our father,

772
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,810
when he gets old and can't move,

773
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,860
can you take care of his toilet needs?

774
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,880
Or can Susu help clear his phlegm?

775
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,810
Hold on, hold on!

776
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,880
Let me ask you,

777
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,490
if Yinzi were your sister,

778
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,520
would you let her marry our father?

779
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,060
Are you my sister?

780
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,590
When you married Feng Dajiao willingly,

781
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,170
did I ever try to stop you?

782
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,070
How is that the same?

783
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,400
Why isn't it the same?

784
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,900
Your head is full of feudal nonsense.

785
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,230
I can't reason with you.

786
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,230
If I'm feudal, then what are you?

787
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,760
We came out of the same womb.

788
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,630
Susu.

789
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,090
Xiuxiu.

790
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,480
What did Father say?

791
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,540
Father is dead set on marrying Yinzi.

792
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,640
Kejin also says that Father has it tough

793
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,800
and is doing the right thing!

794
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
His head is full of feudal nonsense.

795
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,980
Let's go ask Yinzi.

796
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,640
Yinzi?

797
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,000
It's me!

798
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,720
I need to talk to you, Yinzi!

799
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,320
You...

800
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,370
I'm looking for Yinzi.

801
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,920
Ms. Xiuxiu,

802
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,960
please stop making things difficult
for our Yinzi.

803
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,510
She's getting married soon.

804
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,280
Ms. Xiuxiu.

805
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,320
Please

806
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,510
stop interfering in this matter.

807
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,590
If you keep stirring up trouble,

808
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,780
I'll tell the matchmaker

809
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,640
to move the wedding date forward!

810
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,510
Wait, wait.

811
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,980
How can you be so clueless as a father?

812
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,280
You're selling your daughter.

813
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,110
My daughter agreed to this herself.

814
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,320
It has nothing to do with me!

815
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,050
Let Yinzi...

816
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,070
Yinzi!

817
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,800
Kuangzi.

818
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,790
Is this wedding decoration pasted
crookedly?

819
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Only a little bit.

820
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,230
Just a little?

821
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,060
Father, everything is ready.

822
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,690
Father.

823
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,320
Go take a break.

824
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,930
Lianye can keep an eye on things here.

825
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,730
Leave it to me.

826
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,810
Let's go take a break.

827
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,200
Let's go.

828
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,600
Okay.

829
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,280
Take a break!

830
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:00,800
Adjust it?

831
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,490
This is fine.

832
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,150
Wipe... wipe the top there.

833
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,210
It's straight now.

834
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,550
Take a break.

835
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,030
Why don't you tear it off

836
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,360
and paste it again?

837
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,400
Father.

838
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,190
My two sisters,

839
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,920
Susu and Xiuxiu,

840
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,460
have been causing trouble all along.

841
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,360
I think we shouldn't wait another 10 days.

842
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,440
This isn't your first marriage, anyway.

843
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,230
Let's just get this done quickly.

844
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,890
The longer we wait,
the more problems may arise.

845
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,120
Let me think about it.

846
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,870
Or maybe have Uncle Xueshi

847
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,070
check the almanac again for me?

848
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,670
What's there to check?

849
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,090
Take my advice.

850
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,950
Do it three days from now.

851
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,410
Just have the wedding and be done with it.

852
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,520
Can we do it like that?

853
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,110
Yes, we can.

854
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,600
Then I'll listen to you, son.

855
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,570
Three days it is.

856
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,070
Tietou!

857
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,680
Why are you sitting here?

858
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,880
Tietou.

859
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,150
Dajiao and I both think

860
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,110
that you and Yinzi have been together
for so many years.

861
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,570
If you separate like this,

862
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,320
won't you both regret it
for the rest of your lives?

863
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,110
We've come up with an idea for you.

864
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,150
Look, we've brought you some food.

865
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,920
You take

866
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,360
Yinzi and leave tonight.

867
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,110
You two go off
and start a new life somewhere.

868
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,240
The world is so vast.

869
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,710
There must be somewhere
you can settle down.

870
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,240
Look at you, strong as an ox,

871
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,430
and Yinzi is good at working too.

872
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,110
Making a living won't be a problem.

873
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,230
Xiuxiu!

874
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,710
-Susu's here.
-I also brought some food.

875
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,440
My sister-in-law asked, and I said
it was for the disaster victims.

876
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,000
Qing.

877
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,550
Put it... put it over there.

878
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,320
Tietou.

879
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,780
If you two really leave...

880
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,630
sure,

881
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
the village will gossip for a while.

882
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,000
But as time passes,
everyone will forget about it.

883
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Give it a year or so, then come back.

884
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,440
By then,

885
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,320
when everyone sees you two
living well together,

886
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,050
they'll stop talking about it.

887
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,450
How does that sound?

888
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,800
B-But if I leave,

889
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,320
who will take care of my mother?

890
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,650
We'll take good care of your mother.

891
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,780
Don't worry.

892
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,630
Once you've made

893
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,230
something of yourself out there,

894
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,110
just send word,

895
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,660
and I'll send her to you.

896
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,470
What about the land
I've just got on permanent lease?

897
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,320
Who will farm it?

898
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,520
We'll farm it for you.

899
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,890
And after the autumn harvest,

900
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,750
we'll store all the grain for you.

901
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,280
Stop fussing over all that.

902
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,080
You're a grown man. Stop crying.

903
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,960
Okay.

904
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,250
Xiuxiu, Dajiao.

905
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,960
You're both my family.

906
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,920
You wouldn't steer me wrong.

907
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,640
I'll go find Yinzi now

908
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,710
and take her away,

909
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,130
far away from here.

910
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,510
You go back first.

911
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,510
I'll go pack my things

912
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,480
and leave.

913
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,190
You need to hurry.

914
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,190
You need to...

915
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,600
be Yinzi's rock.

916
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,880
We'll tell your mother and others later.

917
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,590
I know.

918
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,140
I'll definitely take Yinzi away.

919
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,560
You can go back first.

920
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,770
I'll go home and pack up.

921
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,410
The sooner you leave, the better.

922
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,760
Let's go.

923
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,590
I know Tietou.

924
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,700
He won't leave.

925
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,510
Susu,

926
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,830
take back the food you brought.

927
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,730
I-I won't take it back.

928
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,930
What if he does leave?

929
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,650
Young Master Kebi!

930
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,000
W-Who's getting married?

931
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,440
My uncle! My uncle.

932
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,980
His uncle is getting married.

933
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,870
Young Master Kebi!

934
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,440
Humpback Guo!

935
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,300
Go fetch the bride for your uncle?

936
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,950
Why isn't there
even a drum and gong troupe?

937
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,950
My uncle said

938
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,440
that my new aunt doesn't want

939
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,840
any drums, any gongs,
or a wedding banquet!

940
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,590
No banquet?

941
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,540
But the tables are all set.

942
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,920
Then it must be for receiving gifts!

943
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,110
Stop!

944
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,820
Xiuxiu?

945
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,630
Stop!

946
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,400
Xiuxiu,

947
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,320
please don't stop me.

948
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,960
Yinzi!

949
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,040
I know you don't want to see me,

950
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,110
but I had to come!

951
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,660
I've even brought luggage for you today!

952
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,890
Come with me to the Women's Association
in town right now!

953
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,110
The Women's Association specifically helps

954
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,550
with our women's problems!

955
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,320
Let them find a solution for you!

956
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,720
If we leave now,
we can get there by evening!

957
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,880
Xiuxiu,

958
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,800
thank you for caring about

959
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,660
my situation these past few days.

960
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,010
I know you're doing all of this for me.

961
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,890
But you also know

962
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,960
that my father

963
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,370
came back after failing to
make a living in the Northeast.

964
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,640
My whole family is

965
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,190
waiting to be fed.

966
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,510
Even if I spend my days on the hillside

967
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,510
digging for wild vegetables
and collecting locust flowers,

968
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,040
I still can't feed all six mouths
in my family.

969
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,590
Xiuxiu.

970
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,840
Do you know?

971
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,160
With this marriage,

972
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,320
my mother

973
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,180
gets to see a doctor and medicine to take.

974
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,800
My father and my siblings

975
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
will have enough food and clothing.

976
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,960
But if I go with you,

977
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,110
my entire family

978
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,900
might not even survive
until harvest time...

979
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,610
Xiuxiu.

980
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,260
I...

981
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,440
I made this choice myself.

982
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,420
I'm trading myself
for my family's survival.

983
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:08,940
I accept it.
