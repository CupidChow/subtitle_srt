00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,759
Right, Xiu?

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,590
Yes.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,710
Father,

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,550
next year at Turtle Hill,

00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,350
you can grow whatever you want,

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,150

Xiuxiu, Dajiao,

13
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,950
I'll head home now.

14
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,190
That was just to soothe Father.

15
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,150
Not angry now?

16
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,030
Who said I was angry?

17
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,730
Then why wouldn't you
grow red sage with me?

18
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,060
Let's go now.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,240
Where to?

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,190
Where to?

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,290

You guys can wrap up too.

25
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,400
Alright, I'll just go through this
one more time before I leave.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
What are you doing?

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
Just let me.

28
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,960

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,800
Xiuxiu,

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,800
I've always wanted to help you,

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,190
but I know how stubborn you are,

33
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,120
and that you'd never ask me for help.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,870
I am truly happy

35
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,829
that you asked today.

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,960
We wouldn't have asked you for help

37
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,410
if it weren't for this urgent situation.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,060
What are you doing?

39
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,710
I'll write you an IOU.

40
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,000
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We're family.

See?

45

Her stubborn streak is kicking in again.

46
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,340
Kejin,

47
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,400
we'll definitely pay you back.

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,360
Don't say that.

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,620
I don't want to hear it.

50

Xiu,

51
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,680
is 12 silver dollars enough?

52
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,640
Let me know if it's not.

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,670
I'll get more from Father.

54
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,200
It is.

55
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,240
And even if it weren't,

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,530
I wouldn't take his money.

57
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,530
Isn't Kejin's money also Father's?

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,120
If that's how you see it,
I won't take the money.

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Exactly.

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
My money is my own.

61
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,910
I know how to make money.

Dajiao. Xiuxiu.

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,560
You should have let me know

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
you were coming,

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,940
I would've prepared some food and drinks.

72
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,940
We're not here to dine.

73
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,540
We came to repay you.

74
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,100
Here are

75
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,370
14 silver dollars.

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,840
Twelve of them are for

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,950
the money you were cheated out of
when buying seedlings for us.

78
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,950
The other two

79
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,310
are the deposit

80
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,780
that Xiuxiu got back from Ning Xueshi.

81
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,060
Count them.

82
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,150
Even I couldn't get the deposit back.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Take these.

84
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,420
Fourteen. Count them.

85
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,240
And then

86
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,250
we'll be quits from now on.

87
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,409
So eager to be quits with me?

88
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,840
Let's not mix things up.

89
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Paying you back

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,370
puts our mind at ease.

91
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,080
Again,

92
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,870
I bought those seedlings voluntarily,

93
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,800
getting scammed was just bad luck,

94
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,510
and I'll bear this loss myself.

95
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,310
I can spend money and I can earn it too.

96
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,170
Making 12 bucks isn't difficult.

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,880
If there's nothing else,

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,210
I won't keep you any longer.

99
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,160
Take...

100
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,240
I'll keep these two, the deposit.

101
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,240
Thank you.

102
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,610
When are you leaving?

103
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,670
We'll see you off.

104
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,300
No need to trouble yourselves.

105
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,270
I've already sent word to my brother

106
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,430
to come find me here.

107
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,030
I'm waiting for him.

108
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,910
This is great.

109
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,210
They've all sprouted.

110
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,590
Don't fiddle with it.

111
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,270
It's amazing,

112
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,030
these little seedlings will grow

113
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,630
and sell for more than grain?

114
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,930
It's the first time I've ever
heard of such a thing.

115
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,730
I heard from Chang Chun

116
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,390
that our ancestors

117
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,170
used to grow these here.

118
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,740
But why is no one growing them now?

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,870
Sounds like our ancestors

120
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,270
had better lives than us.

121
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,510
How do you figure?

122
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,510
Think about it,

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,510
they must have had plenty to eat and wear,

124
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,510
otherwise they wouldn't have chosen
to grow medicinal herbs.

125
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,940
Well, I think our ancestors

126
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,870
didn't have enough food
from growing grain,

127
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,310
so they grew herbs instead,

128
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,070
and then they had enough to eat.

129
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,830
My goodness!

130
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,040
No wonder they say you'reâ€”

131
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,720
What?

132
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,160
The smartest woman in our village.

133
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
People are mortal

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,660
and all get sick at some point.

135
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,060
Grain and medicinal herbs

136
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,410
are equally important.

137
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,840
What matters most is which
makes more money,

138
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,630
isn't that right?

139
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,220
Yes.

140
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,240
Well, when it's time to thin out

141
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,950
these seedlings

142
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,000
and select the best ones,

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,260
I'll be the first to transplant them, OK?

144
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,430
Not too bad.

145
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,190
In the village,

146
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,190
your skills are the best.

147
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,190
No, not at all.

148
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,150
What's...

149
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,230
Come on.

150
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,650
What's going on?

151
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,120
It's Glutton Fei!

152
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
Go get help, hurry!

153
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
Okay, hurry!

154
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,250
Have you all heard?

155
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,950
Glutton Fei didn't make it
to the Northeast.

156
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,810
He begged for food on his way back.

157
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,120
He collapsed and nearly died

158
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,440
at the village entrance,

159
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,610
and had to crawl back home.

160
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,400
His wife and children
carried him onto the bed.

161
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,590
I heard about that too.

162
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,510
His clothes were torn to shreds.

163
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,000
He said he couldn't afford a boat ticket,

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,630
so he had no choice but to follow everyone

165
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,960
all the way east on foot.

166
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,320
Can you imagine?

167
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,690
The little food he brought

168
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,000
was gone in just a couple of days.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,150
No amount would be enough

170
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,550
to fill that big belly of his.

171
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,910
You're absolutely right.

172
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,720
And then came

173
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,090
the locust plague.

174
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,180
And the floods.

175
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
He had to beg for food all the way back.

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,000
It would've been better
if he hadn't come back.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,870
Since he came back,

178
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,720
Yinzi's mother's condition has worsened.

179
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
Suddenly two people bedridden,

180
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,960
one at each side of the bed.

181
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
How can things possibly get better?

182
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,390
No matter how capable Yinzi is,

183
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,190
it's going to be tough this time.

184
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,640
I've also heard that,

185
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,270
during these times of great disaster,

186
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,670
many families are selling their children.

187
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,160
Stop talking nonsense.

188
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,520
How could anyone sell their children?

189
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,440
You don't have children,

190
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,600
so you care.

191
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,650
Like you know everything.

192
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,390
Don't hit me!

193
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,770
Don't use my comb.

194
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,830
Aren't you busy all the time,
like a dog chasing its tail?

195
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,670
How come you're slacking off here now?

196
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,360
My master went to the county town today.

197
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,390
He's not home.

198
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,270
Xiuxiu!

199
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,240
Xiuxiu!

200
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,150
Lianye?

201
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:47,960
You...

202
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,120
What happened to your forehead?

203
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
Where are your in-laws?

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,330
They went to the fields.

205
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,630
Xiuxiu,

206
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,360
please help me.

207
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,920
Your brother has lost his mind.

208
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,670
You're the only one who can stop him now.

209
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,390
What happened?

210
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,690
That woman from outside the village

211
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,810
has opened a gambling house here.

212
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,040
That Lulu?

213
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,340
Yes, that's her!

214
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,250
I was only at my parents' home
for three days,

215
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,180
and your brother

216
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,550
has nearly emptied our house.

217
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,670
All the money I worked so hard to save

218
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,960
is now gone.

219
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,760
If I hadn't come back in time,

220
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,510
he would've also taken

221
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,520
my gold bracelet to gamble with.

222
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,390
When I tried to stop him,

223
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,850
he pushed me to the ground.

224
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,050
He didn't come home last night.

225
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,270
They say

226
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,560
he's staying

227
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,750
at Lulu's place.

228
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,660
Calm down a bit, Lianye.

229
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,570
I didn't even know Lulu was still around.

230
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,380
Let's go take a look.

231
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,440
OK, be careful.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,840
Don't worry.

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
Coming!

234
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,550
Roast chicken!

235
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,570
Peanuts!

236
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,080
You're drinking too slowly!

237
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,900
Humpback Guo.

238
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,020
-A plate of peanuts.
-Peanuts.

239
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,550
Here are your peanuts.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,670
So,

241
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,790
Young Master Kejin is so lucky.

242
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,750
â™ª Please send letters wherever you are â™ª

243
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,560
â™ª Don't you ever forget me â™ª

244
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:31,630
â™ª I always keep you in my heart â™ª

245
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,070
Being the village chief
makes all the difference.

246
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,690
Drinking liquor, listening to musicâ€”

247
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,350
all can be enjoyed in private.

248
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,120
Such good fortune with the ladies.

249
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,720
"Even heroes can't resist
beautiful women."

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,670
Hurry,

251
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,660
go get another bowl for me.

252
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,750
Father,

253
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,670
I want to have some too.

254
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,320
I want to have some too.

255
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,150
I suffered a lot

256
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,960
this time.

257
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,150
I almost starved to death.

258
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,080
Let me have

259
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,390
my fill first.

260
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,420
Let me have my fill.

261
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,870
Hurry up,

262
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,540
bring it to me.

263
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,350
Kejin.

264
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,390
Kejin,

265
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,630
your sister Xiuxiu is here.

266
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,590
Xiu...

267
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,870
What are you panicking about?

268
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm too scared of my sister.

269
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,530
Let me hide in your room.

270
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,610
Come here, Young Master Kejin.

271
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,970
Just sit here and have fun.

272
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,390
I'll handle it for you.

273
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,810
Don't let her in.

274
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,080
Here comes the hostess.

275
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,050
Take your time and enjoy. There's plenty.

276
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,640
OK.

277
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Miss Xiuxiu,

278
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,600
what brought you here today?

279
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,100
I'm not here for you.

280
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,050
I'm looking for my brother Ning Kejin.

281
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,160
It's not your place to do that, is it?

282
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,550
Why didn't your sister-in-law come?

283
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,880
Me or her, it's the same.

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,060
Tell Ning Kejin to come out right now.

285
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,360
What if I tell you he's not here?

286
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,450
He's not here?

287
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,240
Do you dare let me go in and have a look?

288
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,790
Sure.

289
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,150
Come on in.

290
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,120
Look under my bed,

291
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,000
especially inside my blankets.

292
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,370
Make your brother

293
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,100
a famous village chief.

294
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,640
Don't go yet.

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,270
Why stop looking?

296
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,180
You helped Dajiao.

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
I'll save face

298
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,960
for both of us.

299
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,190
A falling-out wouldn't be good for anyone.

300
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Tell Ning Kejin to go home immediately.

301
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,630
From now on,

302
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,440
we won't bother each other,

303
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,300
and will have no further contact.

304
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,390
Lianye.

305
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,910
How did it go? Did you see your brother?

306
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,910
I didn't go in,

307
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,080
but I know

308
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,440
he is in there.

309
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,080
Why didn't you go in?

310
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,080
Lulu is annoyed with me.

311
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
If things got out of hand,

312
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,600
it wouldn't be good for Kejin.

313
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,320
Father hates gambling more than anything.

314
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,440
Why don't you have him talk to Kejin?

315
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,420
Father's not here. He went to
the provincial capital.

316
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,200
They're saying Uncle Bian
is taking a concubine,

317
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,870
so he went to give gifts.

318
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,750
Go home and wait.

319
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,010
He should be back soon.

320
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,910
I'll also try to come up
with something to help.

321
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,440
Alright,

322
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,630
I'll go home and wait for Father now.

323
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,220
How's it going?

324
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,440
Did my boy give you any trouble today?

325
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,770
We're not at that stage yet.
Of course not.

326
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,260
Did you know Lulu hasn't left,

327
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,120
and she's opened a gambling house
in our village?

328
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,730
I've heard about it.

329
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,960
That day when we went to pay her back,

330
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,270
she said she was waiting for Xiaohu.

331
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Do you think she's really
waiting for Xiaohu,

332
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,930
or is that just an excuse?

333
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,670
Right now,

334
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,290
she's the last person I want to deal with.

335
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,150
Look what she's done to our family.

336
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,940
I'm trying my best to avoid her.

337
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,700
She can wait for whomever she wants;
it's none of my business.

338
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,140
I appreciate your stance,

339
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,420
but I want you to go talk to her.
Can you do that?

340
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,140
Talk to her?

341
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,430
I'm not going.

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,550
Lianye came to see me.

343
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,840
She said my brother is under her spell,

344
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,270
doesn't come home anymore,

345
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,130
and has sold all their valuables.

346
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,790
I figured this can't go on,

347
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,690
so I went to talk to Lulu myself.

348
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,870
Guess what?

349
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,790
When she saw me, her eyes
were burning with anger,

350
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,050
as if knives were about to
fly out of them.

351
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,320
I think to untie the bell,
you need the person who tied it.

352
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
She came here for you,

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,260
so maybe she'll listen if you talk to her.

354
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,120
I'm not going.

355
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,240
It's useless.

356
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,720
I've never gambled myself,

357
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,480
but I've heard about it.

358
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,150
You have to overcome
the addiction yourself.

359
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,870
You shut down this gambling den,

360
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,130
there will be another.

361
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,000
Besides,

362
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,900
it's Kejin you need to talk to.

363
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,680
Talking to Lulu won't help.

364
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,080
I'll find someone to talk to Kejin.

365
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,180
As for Lulu,

366
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,360
you have to go whether you want to or not.

367
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,870
I can't let the villagers think

368
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,870
that you brought this trouble
to Ox Temple Village.

369
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,400
What are you talking about?

370
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,140
What do you mean I brought her here?

371
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,090
I didn't. She came on her own.

372
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,670
Fine, fine.

373
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,230
Our Dajiao is so brilliant and powerful

374
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,900
that women from everywhere
come running to you.

375
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,670
It wasn't you. Come on and eat.

376
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,380
Just this one woman

377
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,150
has already given me

378
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,600
more trouble than I can handle.

379
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,060
"Women from everywhere"?

380
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,970
How am I supposed to survive that?

381
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,310
I'll go tomorrow.

382
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,020
Have some more.

383
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,430
Have some more.

384
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:22,339
â™ª In the maiden's chamber she embroiders â™ª

385
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,650
Humpback Guo,

386
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,180
draw another 20 silver dollars for me!

387
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,550
Dajiao?

388
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,040
What a rare visitor!

389
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,550
Kejin,

390
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,920
stop and go home now.

391
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,320
Go home? Why? Come, sit down!

392
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,310
Sit down and join us.

393
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,160
Well, no.

394
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,870
I'm here for something else.

395
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,210
Don't lead him astray.

396
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,440
He's not like you.

397
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,250
Looking for me?

398
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,540
Come in, we'll talk here.

399
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,560
Come...

400
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,440
Dajiao.

401
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,070
He's my brother-in-law!

402
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,200
He's married!

403
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
I know.

404
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,000
Dajiao, have a seat.

405
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,400
I'll fix you some snacks.

406
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,460
We can talk while we eat.

407
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,330
Don't bother.

408
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,750
I'll say what I came to say and leave.

409
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,720
I just wanted you to have
some decent food.

410
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,030
I know what kind of meals you get at home.

411
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,390
Alright then,

412
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,960
if you ever want a change
of taste, just come by.

413
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,740
I'll be waiting for you.

414
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,590
I'm good.

415
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,900
I'm happy with the food at home.

416
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,930
And I don't gamble.

417
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,530
I won't be coming here again.

418
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,710
I just wanted to tell you that

419
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,310
what you're doing here isn't honest work.

420
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,310
Just leave.

421
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm not leaving.

422
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,010
Why should I leave?

423
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,980
I've got a talent for making money.

424
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,210
I need to earn back what I've lost.

425
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,030
Otherwise, how will I help Xiaohu

426
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,590
get married and build a house?

427
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,160
You can't make money this way.

428
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,310
What's wrong with this?

429
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,620
It's not like I'm selling my body.

430
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,220
I don't even have to sing now.

431
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,900
I just run a gambling den
and take a cut.

432
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,250
Why can't I do this?

433
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,200
You're not really waiting
for Xiaohu, are you?

434
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,670
Just tell me what it would take
for you to leave.

435
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,060
You're that eager to see me leave?

436
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,960
Just leave.

437
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,720
Wouldn't you be happier
anywhere else but here?

438
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,120
I suppose it's more about

439
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,720
whether Xiuxiu would be happier if I left?

440
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,050
It used to be, but now
it's not entirely so.

441
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,260
Running this gambling den, you...

442
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,550
You're ruining people's lives!

443
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,070
If I leave,

444
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,350
will you miss me?

445
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,030
Fine, I'll leave.

446
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,330
But you have to promise

447
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,070
to drink a pot of liquor with me.

448
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,790
I'll leave

449
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,460
after we drink.

450
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,250
Dajiao,

451
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,020
drink slowly. Take your time.

452
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,110
Here,

453
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,350
I'll drink this one with you.

454
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,870
Young Master Kejin,

455
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,090
shouldn't it be you in there?

456
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,610
Why is it someone else?

457
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,350
That's my brother-in-law.

458
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,830
Dajiao is an honest man.

459
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,080
Dajiao is inside?

460
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
Why are you back again?

461
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,610
You lost your shirt,

462
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,720
do you even have money to gamble?

463
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,960
What do you mean I lost my shirt?

464
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,560
Look what I have here.

465
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,030
My wife says

466
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,200
this

467
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,240
came from the palace.

468
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,070
Guiyao,

469
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,200
take a look.

470
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,330
How much is it worth?

471
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,700
Drink slowly. Don't make yourself sick.

472
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
When are you leaving?

473
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,540
You're that eager to see me leave?

474
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,310
When are you leaving?

475
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,570
I'll see you off at the village entrance.

476
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,970
You promise?

477
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,030
Well, I...

478
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,350
I'm not leaving.

479
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:47,860
You...

480
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,160
Go ahead and gamble!

481
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,980
Go ahead and gamble!

482
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,790
Go ahead and gamble!

483
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
What are you doing?

484
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,380
That's my wife's bottle!

485
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,890
Honey!

486
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,700
Don't run!

487
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,590
Come on, it's not that big of a deal!

488
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't run!

489
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
Xiuxiu!

490
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,160
Help me!

491
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,850
Get over here!

492
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,590
She's gone crazy! She's trying to kill me!

493
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,790
Get out of the way!

494
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm going to chop you up today, I swear!

495
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,240
You're useless at everything, and
now you've taken up gambling!

496
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,790
I'm not gambling.

497
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,440
First you stole my bottle to gamble,

498
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,550
and now you're trying to
steal the land deed?

499
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,470
Good for you, Zhuzi.

500
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,750
I'll break your arms today,

501
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,950
and your legs too, to teach you a lesson!

502
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,030
Come here!

503
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,830
Stop!

504
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,550
I didn't gamble with the bottle, I swear.

505
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,510
Where's the bottle then? Bring it back!

506
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,510
The bottle...

507
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,270
The bottle was broken

508
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,250
by Guo Guiyao at Lulu's place.

509
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,880
What did you say?

510
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,350
Well...

511
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,160
If Guo Guiyao hadn't broken it,

512
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,020
I could've sold it for some money,

513
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,510
and won back some money
with a couple of bets.

514
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,160
Then I wouldn't have had to

515
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,940
take our land deed, right?

516
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,620
Zhuzi!

517
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,400
That was the most precious
thing in my dowry!

518
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,790
My mother only had those few possessions

519
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,190
to leave me as keepsakes.

520
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,960
You actually broke it!

521
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,160
I'll kill you!

522
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,640
I'll kill you!

523
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,880
Uncle! Auntie!

524
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,960
She's gone mad! She's trying to kill me!

525
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,200
My goodness!

526
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,840
A slap or two is enough

527
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,070
between a couple. No need to use a knife!

528
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,950
Uncle, please be the judge.

529
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,490
He was going to gamble with our land deed!

530
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,510
You good-for-nothing! How dare you!

531
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,470
Trying to ruin your life?

532
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,630
Well, it was because

533
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,510
Dajiao got drunk with Lulu

534
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,970
that my bottle got broken!

535
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,790
Zhuzi,

536
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,200
Dajiao got drunk?

537
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,370
He was drinking with Lulu and got drunk,

538
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,070
overturned tables and left.

539
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,070
Where did he go?

540
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,240
How would I know?

541
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,930
What's going on?

542
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,110
Xiuxiu!

543
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,030
Xiuxiu!

544
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,520
Lianye.

545
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,170
Father's back.

546
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,610
He's going to the gambling house
to get your brother.

547
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,090
Come with me now.

548
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,700
I fear that your brother
might hit me again.

549
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,680
Father, Mother.

550
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,030
I'll go with her

551
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,800
and see if Dajiao is there.

552
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,640
Are you sure?

553
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,700
If you're going,

554
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,030
be sure to take care of her.

555
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,290
She's carrying my grandchild.

556
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,080
Don't worry, Auntie.

557
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,020
Be careful!

558
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:38,810
Be careful.

559
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,200
Where are you going?

560
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,520
Go home with your wife!

561
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,160
I'll go help out.

562
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,960
Get over here!

563
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,720
I'll deal with you when we get back.

564
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,160
That's not necessary.

565
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,750
Hurry!

566
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,510
Ouch!

567
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,530
Let me deal with you when we're home.

568
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,030
Big! Small! Small!

569
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,210
Father?

570
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,880
Why are you here?

571
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,030
Kuangzi, close the door.

572
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,270
Please don't blame me.

573
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,830
Don't close the door, Kuangzi!

574
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,550
I'm going to trap you in here

575
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,060
and teach you a lesson,

576
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,920
you ungrateful, family-ruining
little bastard!

577
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,200
If you call me a bastard,

578
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,920
aren't you insulting yourself too?

579
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,510
Don't!

580
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,750
Father, please don't!

581
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,350
Calm down!

582
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,350
Mr. Ning...

583
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,590
Don't.

584
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,160
Father!

585
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,070
Don't. Please don't.

586
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,440
Father!

587
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,200
Mr. Ning,

588
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,590
I've heard so much about you.

589
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,790
Why are you so angry, Mr. Ning?

590
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,920
How about I warm up some liquor for you?

591
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,200
Have a drink and calm down, OK?
Please stop.

592
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
I don't want your liquor.

593
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,590
Stop pulling me.

594
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,350
What are you doing, Father?

595
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,550
Stand still, don't move.

596
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,210
Don't move.

597
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,640
There're so many people here, Father.

598
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,750
Father!

599
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,070
Father!

600
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,270
My ear's coming off, Father,

601
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,680
let go!

602
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,180
Father!

603
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,260
Father!

604
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,850
It really hurts!

605
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,640
Father!

606
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,510
Father, please don't be angry.

607
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,710
How can I not be angry?

608
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,180
Out of my way!

609
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,310
Listen,

610
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,290
if you come here again,
I'll break your legs!

611
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,960
Master, please calm down.

612
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Do you think I can?

613
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,980
What do you want?

614
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,260
Your son still owes me money.

615
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,720
The things you broke,

616
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,200
and the things Dajiao broke,

617
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,600
you need to pay for
all of those. Otherwise,

618
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,930
I won't let you leave.

619
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,000
I didn't gamble at your place.

620
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,730
You won't get anything from me!

621
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,700
You're trying to dodge the debt,
aren't you?

622
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,760
Or,

623
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,540
would you prefer if I camped
outside your house?

624
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,030
Even if you move into my house,

625
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,650
you'll get the same answerâ€”

626
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,940
you won't get anything from me.

627
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,530
Fine.

628
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,310
Then

629
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,350
I'll move into your house

630
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,850
and settle accounts

631
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,160
with you two.

632
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,430
Let's go, Kuangzi.

633
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
See you later.

634
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,360
What are you doing here?

635
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,570
Where's Dajiao?

636
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,000
Why aren't you keeping an eye

637
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,030
on your own man?

638
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Dajiao got drunk drinking with me.

639
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,200
He's lying in my room now.

640
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,480
Why don't you go in and check on him?

641
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,150
I...

642
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,200
Xiu! Xiu!

643
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,630
Be careful!

644
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,080
Take it easy, Xiu!

645
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,720
Father!

646
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,270
Mother!

647
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,110
Is Dajiao back yet?

648
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,030
No, not yet.

649
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,590
Where did he go?

650
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,190
I think he's too embarrassed to come home

651
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,270
because Lulu got him drunk.

652
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,670
He's not at Lulu's place?

653
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,720
Don't you know your own son?

654
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,400
Even if he's drunk, he'd be
outside somewhere.

655
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,730
He wouldn't stay there.

656
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,580
Xiu, don't worry,

657
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,940
your father and I will go
look for him. Come on.

658
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,970
I want to go too.

659
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,220
It'd be too much for you.

660
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,090
I'll be fine.

661
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,350
Be careful.

662
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,920
Dajiao!

663
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,310
Dajiao!

664
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,240
Dajiao!

665
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,000
Old Man,

666
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,750
let's split up.

667
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,880
You go search over there,

668
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,410
and we'll look around here.

669
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,790
Be careful, Father!

670
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,070
He's probably

671
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,530
fallen asleep somewhere.

672
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,650
If all this night dew

673
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,440
gets into his bones, it'll be terrible.

674
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,520
Dajiao!

675
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,350
Dajiao!

676
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,110
Dajiao!

677
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,790
He wouldn't be drunk if he could answer.

678
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,640
Don't call too hard.

679
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,350
Let's just keep looking.

680
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,160
Dajiao!

681
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,560
Don't call too hard.

682
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,310
Why don't we check

683
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,690
Tietou's shack?

684
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,440
OK.

685
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,500
Mother! Mother!

686
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,490
-Dajiao!
-Dajiao!

687
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,750
What are you doing here?

688
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,810
Dajiao, wake up.

689
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,640
Get up now.

690
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,970
Don't try to move him.

691
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,680
He's too heavy.

692
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,200
You stay here with him for a bit.

693
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,110
I'll go back

694
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,010
and get people to bring
a door panel to carry him.

695
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,200
Look at the state he's in.

696
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
He must be feeling terrible.

697
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,440
Dajiao!

698
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,750
Dajiao!

699
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,640
Dajiao!

700
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,650
Stay away!

701
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,920
He's such a simple, honest man.

702
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,920
Why did you trick him into
drinking so much?

703
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,080
Look how sick he is. Are you happy now?

704
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,890
You love drinking, don't you?

705
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,820
I'll drink with you.

706
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,790
Do you dare drink with me?

707
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,160
Why wouldn't I dare?

708
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,030
I haven't done anything wrong,

709
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,350
so why wouldn't I dare?

710
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,130
It's only drinking.

711
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,350
I've seen people swallow knives.

712
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,960
If you're to drink with me,

713
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,070
I'm not sure you can afford to lose.

714
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,640
OK.

715
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,080
We'll make a gamble out of this.

716
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,440
A gamble on drinking.

717
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,740
If you lose, you leave.

718
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,550
If I lose,

719
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,570
Dajiao is yours.

720
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,510
OK.

721
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,630
It's a deal.

722
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,710
When and where are we drinking?

723
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,030
This time tomorrow. Just the two of us.

724
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,270
At Turtle Hill. We'll each
bring our own liquor.

725
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,310
Whoever doesn't show up is a dog.

726
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,590
Is Young Master behaving himself now?

727
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,400
He is, really.

728
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,400
He hasn't gone out. Very well-behaved.

729
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,440
If he acts up again,

730
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,170
I won't give him a single penny.

731
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,750
Kuangzi,

732
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,330
can you smell any fragrance on my jacket?

733
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,000
No.

734
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,490
Your nose isn't working right.

735
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,530
I can smell it.

736
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,660
A strange kind of fragrance.

737
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,400
It's on this gown too.

738
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm covered in it.

739
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,920
Do I have it on my face?

740
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,010
M-Master.

741
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,240
E-Easy on the liquor.

742
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,670
I-I'll get you a pancake.

743
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,240
Time to eat!

744
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,270
Here's yours.

745
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,330
One per person. Here.

746
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,620
Hurry up.

747
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,710
Can I get a bit more?
This won't be enough.

748
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,090
This isn't your first day working for us.

749
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
One per person.

750
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,570
But there's still some left.

751
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,370
Stop nagging.

752
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,580
Big Head Li.

753
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,130
Master, you're here.

754
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,850
Have you finished planting your fields?

755
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,550
Yes, Master, almost done.

756
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,840
I was wondering why you came
to work as a laborer for me.

757
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,340
To be honest, Master,

758
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,440
we're trying to earn some money for seeds.

759
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,890
We still have a plot of land
at home for corn,

760
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,310
but no money for seeds.

761
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,050
You're quite the schemer.

762
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,550
You rent my land,

763
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,040
and then work for me as a laborer,

764
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,010
earning my money to buy seeds.

765
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,750
Well, it's closer here.

766
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,750
Besides, I prefer working for you, Master,

767
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,070
rather than traveling far for labor work.

768
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,030
Plus I have elderly parents
and young children;

769
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,360
can't be away from them.

770
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,250
Keep a good eye on these
outside laborers for me.

771
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,080
Don't let them slack off.

772
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,600
Yes, I'll definitely keep
a close eye for you.

773
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,110
Master, can I discuss something with you?

774
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,160
My wages for this labor work...

775
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,250
could they be adjusted?

776
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,160
How?

777
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,400
You don't want any? That's fine.

778
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Well... no....

779
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,790
You're my tenant.

780
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,830
You should be working for me
for free anyway.

781
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,020
Master, um, well,

782
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,320
what I meant was that my wages

783
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,040
shouldn't be less than theirs, right?

784
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,350
I work really hard.

785
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,570
You can

786
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,920
ask them yourself.

787
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,350
It's only right

788
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,590
that you work hard for me.

789
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,310
You're my hired hand,

790
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,990
dependent on me for food.

791
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,840
You're not like the others.

792
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,110
Let me tell you,

793
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,370
take it or leave it.

794
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,850
Plenty of others will do it if you won't.

795
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,520
No, no, no.

796
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,310
I'll do it.

797
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,970
I'll work hard.

798
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,590
Kuangzi,

799
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,400
bring me the leftover buns.

800
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,900
I'll take them with me.

801
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,790
OK.

802
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,190
Here you go, Master.

803
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,280
It really is three characters.

804
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,260
Four of bamboo.

805
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,750
You startled me.

806
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,750
When did you get here?

807
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,200
You walk so quietly.

808
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,080
Why are there so few people today?

809
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,180
Ning Kejin didn't come.

810
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,240
Zhuzi didn't come.

811
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,790
Even Niu Wu didn't come.

812
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,840
Many others were dragged
home by their wives

813
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,990
to pull weeds.

814
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,340
Well, since there aren't
many people today,

815
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,840
I might as well go back
and sell some goods.

816
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,070
Lots of people have been
asking me for salt.

817
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,199
Listen to yourself.

818
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,590
Thinking only about that petty business,

819
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,120
when will you ever get rich?

820
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,150
Go on then.

821
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,590
I'll be very quick.

822
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,260
Look, I have a flower.

823
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,980
It's beautiful.

824
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,160
Let's go.

825
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,590
Catch it!

826
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,960
They're pretty.

827
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,910
I'm taking them all.

828
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,080
They're with me.

829
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,410
Do you know whose land you're digging up?

830
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,570
Dig away.

831
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,510
When you're done,

832
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,760
I'll take it back to feed my oxen.

833
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,360
I'm just joking with you.

834
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,840
What a stubborn girl.

835
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,550
Dig away.

836
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,690
As long as you don't
step on the seedlings,

837
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,790
dig wherever you want.

838
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,390
I'll tell Kuangzi

839
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,610
not to chase you away.

840
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,240
Don't take it.

841
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,620
I don't want it.

842
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,570
I don't want it!

843
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,800
Yinzi!

844
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,940
Yinzi,

845
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,080
Mother's breathing so badly
she passed out.

846
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,030
Yinzi.

847
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,840
Buns.

848
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,740
There're buns in the basket.

849
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,190
Mr. Liu,

850
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
we need medicine.

851
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,670
Fei Yinzi,

852
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,400
your father hasn't paid for
the medicine from last time.

853
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,600
Can you pay this time?

854
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,850
I'll pay for everything next time.

855
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,590
The doctor said to prepare
ten doses of this.

856
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,870
You think you can get
things for free again?

857
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,600
We're running a business here.

858
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
I'll definitely pay next time, OK?

859
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,760
Please prepare ten doses for me.
My mother is sick.

860
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,560
I can't prepare it for you today.

861
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,780
Where did this medicine come from?

862
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,150
It was brought by Kuangzi.

863
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,110
He said it will reduce Mother's swelling.

864
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:30,670
Yinzi,

865
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Mother is asleep.

866
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,780
Her breathing is much better now.

867
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,230
The Master also said if we
need anything in the future,

868
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,960
you can go to his place to get it.

869
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,120
He also gave us some dried sweet potatoes.

870
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,360
Father was happy and grabbed a handful

871
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,020
before heading to the fields.

872
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,730
Father said that once
Mother's medicine runs out,

873
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,660
you should go to Master's place
for money to buy more.

874
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,280
Yinzi!

875
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,150
Yinzi.

876
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,880
Tietou.

877
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,750
Take this.

878
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,110
Eat it sparingly.

879
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,880
Tietou!

880
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,630
Tietou!

881
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,280
Tietou!

882
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,190
Here.

883
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,900
Keep it. I won't take it.

884
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,310
Why won't you take it?

885
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,280
Take it. I'll work it out.

886
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,810
How are you going to manage?

887
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,280
Keep it.

888
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,400
That's my cornmeal, give it back!

889
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,170
Give it back to me!

890
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,030
Mother!

891
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,000
You only care about feeding yourself!

892
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,550
What about me?

893
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,400
You keep tempting Tietou

894
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,110
to steal food from home for you.

895
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,170
He's becoming a thief because of you!

896
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,880
A perfectly good man

897
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,560
ruined by your bad influence!

898
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,590
Mother!

899
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
You little temptress.

900
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,070
All you do is hooking up with men!

901
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,400
That's enough, Mother!

902
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,770
Why don't you hook up with a man

903
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,150
who can feed your entire family?

904
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,300
Why are you after Tietou?

905
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,600
Mother, please stop!

906
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,660
We're almost starving to death.

907
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
Give it back to me.

908
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,750
The heavens are so cruel,

909
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,410
sending drought during the lean season.

910
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,830
This little bit of cornmeal,

911
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,810
I barely touch it even myself...

912
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,320
You little beast!

913
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,520
Still caring about Yinzi's family!

914
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,520
I don't even know

915
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,010
where our next meal is coming from.

916
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,080
Tietou.

917
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,910
Don't let your mother make a scene here.

918
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,920
Go home.

919
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,960
People are watching.

920
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,550
What are you looking at?

921
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,280
Get lost!

922
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,670
Yinzi.

923
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,290
It's very sweet. Have a try.

924
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,340
Sweet, isn't it?

925
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,760
Really sweet.

926
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,760
Heavy dew in the evening.

927
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,510
I've built this fire

928
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
for both of us.

929
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,640
Good.

930
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,790
Very nice.

931
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,140
We can finally

932
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,070
have a proper conversation in this light.

933
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,280
Were you thinking that
this is your village,

934
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,230
your territory,

935
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,700
and I wouldn't dare come here?

936
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,570
Let me drink from your jar.

937
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,360
You'll drink from mine.

938
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,110
Why?

939
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,100
You think I'm trying to trick you
with watered-down liquor?

940
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,710
Here.

941
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,360
Have a try.

942
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,930
Authentic sweet potato liquor.

943
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,890
The foreshot.

944
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,100
That's not what I mean.

945
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,030
I wanted to trade with you

946
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,230
because Dajiao drank a jar of this

947
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,100
and passed out for a whole day.

948
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,150
I know

949
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,390
your liquor has a strong kick.

950
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,150
You're so eager to win,

951
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,810
you'll surely drink too much.

952
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,980
I don't want you to suffer like that.

953
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,920
Don't talk like you're
better at drinking than me.

954
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,250
I'm not intimidated by your show of force.

955
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I don't know if I'm good at drinking.

956
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,320
I've never tried before.

957
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,760
But I want to drink with you once.

958
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,320
Fine.

959
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,150
If you think my liquor is too strong,

960
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,150
I'll drink mine and you drink yours.

961
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,230
But let's be clear,

962
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,150
you need to have an idea whether or not
you're going to win.

963
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,350
You need to be willing

964
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,710
to accept defeat.

965
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,360
Deal.

966
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,190
This first bowl,

967
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,620
I'll drink it up.

968
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,820
You do as you please.

969
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,480
This is my toast of gratitude.

970
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,750
I thank you for being so kind.

971
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,810
You helped Dajiao in his time of need

972
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,410
by buying seedlings for him.

973
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,280
No matter how this turns out,

974
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,010
I'll always owe you my thanks.
