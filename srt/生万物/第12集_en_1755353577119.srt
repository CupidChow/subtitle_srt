[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,680
Dajiao.

4
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,590
Did Mr. Du leave this?

5
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,479
He must have left it secretly.

6
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,870
I'll catch up with him
and return the money.

7
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,789
He's been gone for so long.

8
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,450
Where would you even find him?

9
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,010
Well...

10
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's keep

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,260
this money for now.

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,540
You should go downtown

13
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,470
to return it to Mr. Du in person.

14
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,720
Alright.

15
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,900
What are you doing?

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,620
Strangers are easy to keep out;

17
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,680
it's family you can't guard against.

18
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
What are you up to?

19
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,560
You're hoping I'll die soon, aren't you?

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,020
Stop talking nonsense. Aren't you ashamed?

21
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,250
What do you mean nonsense?

22
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,900
I have the land deed right here.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm an honest man

24
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,060
with nothing to hide.

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
You old hag,

26
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,000
sneaking in at midnight
to steal my land deed.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Behave, or I'll divorce you!

28
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,620
Oh my goodness,

29
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,040
please divorce me already!

30
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,970
I've spent most of my life with you.

31
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,360
You'd scrape gold paint off
a Buddha statue's face if you could,

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,280
always looking for any advantage.

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,880
I've become thick-skinned
from living with you.

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,690
We can't farm Tietou's land.

35
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,850
Don't you know that?

36
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,030
What are you doing at midnight
instead of sleeping?

37
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,380
Ask your mother

38
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,560
what she did.

39
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,410
Mother, what did you do?

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
I didn't do anything.

41
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,570
I was trying to get the land deed,
but I couldn't.

42
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,680
A thief in the family.
A thief in the family!

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,510
Mother,

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,530
you were right to try to take

45
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,390
that land deed.

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,630
You two are on the same side, aren't you?

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
You're teaming up on me, huh?

48
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,960
The 15-mu land
that should've come as dowry

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
has always been

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,420
a thorn in my side.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,460
Now you won't let me have the new land.

52
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,360
And that outsiderâ€”

53
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,540
she's never on our side.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,079
I can't live like this anymore!

55
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,430
Stop talking nonsense.

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,840
I want her to hear it.

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,520
Father,

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,190
who should hear what?

59
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,910
You.

60
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,460
Please don't be angry.

61
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,340
I think

62
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,630
since you got Tietou's land

63
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,840
by virtue of the draw,

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,460
you should farm it.

65
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,070
Spring is coming soon.

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,110
Father, you need to think carefully

67
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,820
about how to farm it and what to plant.

68
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,410
You hear that?

69
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,329
You hear that?

70
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,040
That's the Feng family's
daughter-in-law talking.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,870
Educated people

72
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,860
really do speak differently.

73
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,040
She's sensible

74
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,270
and reasonable.

75
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,800
You sure changed your tune fast.

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,650
My gosh.

77
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,240
What do you mean?

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Mother, Father,

79
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,580
you two get some rest.

80
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,320
Let's go.

81
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,930
Stop fussing and go to sleep.

82
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,190
Behave, or one day I'll divorce you.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,600
Go ahead. I'm waiting.

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,680
You don't get to say that.

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,870
When you married into the Feng family,

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,430
the matchmaker said
you were only three years older than me

87
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,050
and that an older wife
brought good fortune.

88
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,030
But it turns out

89
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,000
you're nine years older than me!

90
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,070
So what? Triple good fortune.

91
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,580
Didn't we agree

92
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,820
we can't farm Tietou's land?

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,020
Yes, we can't farm it,

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,190
but do you think
we can get the land deed back?

95
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,480
I think in this situation,

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,270
we should go with the flow.

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,680
Maybe something will turn around.

98
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,040
How?

99
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,600
What?

100
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,890
Dajiao is going to work in town,

101
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,650
earning an official wage?

102
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,350
Wow, wow.

103
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,900
Why are you wowing?

104
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,230
What's going on?

105
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,670
Dajiao,

106
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,350
you can't keep this
from Father any longer.

107
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,330
Hurry up,

108
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,630
tell him about Mr. Du inviting you

109
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,980
to work in town.

110
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,159
Mr. Du?

111
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,190
The Mr. Du who came

112
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,520
to our house yesterday?

113
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,000
He wants

114
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,270
to invite me to work in town.

115
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,350
He thinks I'm

116
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,110
honest, decent, and reliable.

117
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,600
He came specifically to invite me.

118
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,310
He also said

119
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,420
I get silver dollars every month

120
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,470
and can even take my family along.

121
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,520
Oh my goodness,

122
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,270
this is wonderful news!

123
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,360
Your ancestors must be blessing you.

124
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,750
Your son is going to make it big!

125
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,080
Make it big, my foot!
Be quiet for a moment.

126
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,630
This is such a big matter.

127
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,800
Why didn't you discuss it
with Father and Mother first?

128
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,680
If you leave,

129
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,470
with our 18 mu of land,

130
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,530
plus Tietou's 13 mu,

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,320
how can I manage it all by myself?

132
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,000
Of course you can't handle it all.

133
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
If you can just take care of our land,

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
that's already good enough.

135
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,200
So you'd better

136
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,520
give those 13 mu of land

137
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,760
back to Mrs. Fei

138
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,440
so she can return it to Tietou.

139
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,580
Y-You brat, are you making this up
to mess with me?

140
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
You'd better go now.

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,070
You're just making Father angry.

142
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,510
Fine, I'm going.

143
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
I'll go fetch

144
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,230
some more water for you.

145
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,780
And then I'll head to town.

146
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,970
Off to town!

147
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,140
Xiuxiu.

148
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,300
Is he pulling my leg?

149
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,390
Father,

150
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,290
I wouldn't dare lie to you about this.

151
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,870
Mr. Du really did approach him.

152
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,000
He said

153
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,420
he gave Dajiao

154
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,410
10 silver dollars as a deposit,

155
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,900
and if he goes,

156
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,410
he'll give another 10.

157
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,030
20 silver dollars in total
for settling in.

158
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,510
I almost forgot.

159
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,390
My hands are too small

160
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,540
to hold so many silver dollars.

161
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,850
Father.

162
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't be mad

163
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,020
at Dajiao.

164
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,600
Keep that land of Tietou

165
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,830
and think about

166
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,110
what to plant there.

167
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,320
Mother, take a rest.

168
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,159
This boy's getting ambitious.

169
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,630
Ambitious!

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,320
Kneel!

171
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,850
Second Boss,

172
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,390
we've questioned him already.

173
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,310
He's not in the trade,

174
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:06,750
but he's willing

175
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,800
to be our guide.

176
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,750
He holds weddings and funerals for people,

177
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,200
so he knows this village very well.

178
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
He's happy to lead the way for us.

179
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,720
That's right, that's right.

180
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,800
Boss, I know this area well.

181
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,680
In this villageâ€¦

182
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,200
In...

183
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,230
in this village,

184
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,130
the wealthiest family

185
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,590
is Pan Xiaogui's family.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
When I was a farm laborer,

187
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,000
I had this place

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,860
mapped out perfectly.

189
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,169
Second Boss,

190
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:41,870
this man

191
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,470
is quick-witted and useful.

192
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

193
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,610
Alright.

194
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,100
I'm leaving him in your hands.

195
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,750
If anything happens,

196
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,150
you two will take the blame.

197
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,670
Yes.

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Keep the land or keep your sonâ€”

199
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,390
that's up to you.

200
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,080
Every month, h-heâ€¦

201
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,120
he gets a salary.

202
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,010
There are also 20 silver dollars
for settling in.

203
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,510
Dajiao only knows farming.

204
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,000
What could he possibly do

205
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,510
in the town?

206
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,100
Since he was little,

207
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
I've always known

208
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,510
he was heaven-sent.

209
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,140
First, he married an angel of a wife,

210
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,590
and now he's going to work in town.

211
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,590
In the future,

212
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
he might even
go to the provincial capital.

213
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,150
Dajiao,

214
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,370
take these sorghum pancakes with you.

215
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,200
No need.

216
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,570
Take them with you.

217
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,650
If you can't find a ride into town,

218
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,100
it'll be dark by the time you get there.

219
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm leaving.

220
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,390
So Dajiao is going to town

221
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,380
to force your father to give up that land?

222
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,190
Then this Mr. Du thing is fake?

223
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,470
He didn't invite Dajiao?

224
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,120
Mother,

225
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,780
Mr. Du did invite Dajiao,

226
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,840
but Dajiao

227
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,790
didn't agree.

228
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,550
Mr. Du left 10 silver dollars,

229
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,550
told him to think about it, and left.

230
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,200
Silly boy. That's a good opportunity.

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,550
Why didn't he agree?

232
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
Dajiao said

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,060
he can't bear to leave you and Father,

234
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,490
and he doesn't want to give up farming.

235
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,440
He's afraid he wouldn't know

236
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,530
how to do anything else.

237
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,340
What a fool!

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,040
Who's born knowing everything?

239
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,920
You learn, and you'll know.

240
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,100
Mother,

241
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,750
when he comes back,

242
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
you should talk to him.

243
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh, Mother,

244
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,620
I need to visit the Fei family later

245
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,680
to talk about Tietou's land.

246
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,970
You can't go empty-handed.

247
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,830
Wait a moment.

248
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,510
No need, Mother.

249
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,220
Xiu,

250
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,900
it's nothing fancy,

251
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,510
just perilla seeds we harvested last year.

252
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,750
Already ground into powder.

253
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,600
Listen, tell them

254
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
to put it in a bowl,
sprinkle a little salt,

255
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,360
and eat it with buns. It's delicious.

256
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,120
Mother, you worked hard to save that.

257
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,330
Don't give it away.

258
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,060
You can't ask for favors empty-handed.

259
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,940
Wait here.

260
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,720
Mother.

261
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,480
Wait here.

262
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,030
Madam,

263
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,470
the guest is here.

264
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,960
Hey, Xiuxiu.

265
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,030
Mrs. Fei.

266
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
Susu, come out.

267
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,720
Xiuxiu is here.

268
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,550
Xiuxiu,

269
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,840
why are you here?

270
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,990
This is perilla seed powder
that my mother-in-law grew

271
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,020
and ground herself.

272
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,900
I-I brought some for you.

273
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,790
You don't need to bring anything.

274
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,130
Xiuxiu, come to my room.

275
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,960
This matterâ€¦

276
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,630
it's not impossible.

277
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,840
Mrs. Fei, thank you so much.

278
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't thank me yet,
and don't rush to leave.

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,810
Sit down. I have more to say.

280
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,480
Okay.

281
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I also

282
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,200
have a favor to ask.

283
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,960
If this works out,

284
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,530
Tietou can keep

285
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,630
farming that land.

286
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,540
Go ahead. What is it?

287
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,070
I want you

288
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,200
to write to Wendian

289
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,010
and persuade him to come back.

290
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,630
Me?

291
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,320
Alright.

292
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,790
I'll write to him.

293
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,010
Stay for lunch.

294
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,360
You must stay for lunch.

295
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,220
As long as Wendian comes back,

296
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,150
I'll take care of Tietou's matter
for you right away.

297
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,090
I'll go prepare the meal.

298
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,400
You think about what to write here.

299
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,310
Take your time.

300
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,600
Xiuxiu,

301
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,740
a-are you really going to write a letter

302
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,470
to ask Fei Wendian to come back?

303
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,720
What?

304
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,050
You don't want him to come back?

305
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm scared.

306
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,450
I don't know what to do.

307
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,720
Silly girl.

308
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,050
Dajiao went to town.

309
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,450
Someone offered him a job there.

310
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,870
If he accepts,

311
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,810
I'll go with Dajiao and take you along.

312
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,600
That would be wonderful.

313
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll go with you for sure.

314
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,380
Susu,

315
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,750
stop pestering your sister.

316
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,520
Come on, go to the kitchen with me

317
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,080
to make something delicious for Xiuxiu.

318
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
Be good. Come on.

319
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,890
Take your time.

320
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,000
There's no rush.

321
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,340
What?

322
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,360
He just left like that?

323
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,550
Yes.

324
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,600
Xiuxiu went toâ€¦

325
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,790
Look, Xiuxiu is back from seeing him off.

326
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,360
Father.

327
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,180
Mother,

328
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,850
let me help you wash that.

329
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,270
You hang the laundry.

330
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,390
Xiuxiu,

331
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,390
when you saw Dajiao off,

332
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,150
did he find a ride?

333
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,510
Mother,

334
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,970
I walked a long way with him,

335
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,420
all the way to Xiatun.

336
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,790
He found a ride in the end,

337
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,880
but he probably won't reach town
until dark.

338
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,740
Wait, wait.

339
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,050
You saw him off?

340
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,360
Why didn't you stop him?

341
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,840
Father,

342
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,730
what are you saying?

343
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,670
I'm just a woman.

344
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,480
How can I defy my husband?

345
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,940
Besides, with my strength,

346
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,510
you think I could actually stop your son?

347
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,390
Father,

348
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,220
Dajiao was actually reluctant to leave.

349
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,980
But he said in the current situation,

350
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,090
he had no choice but to go.

351
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,260
What situation?

352
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,750
Why did he have to leave?

353
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,120
He was too ashamed to stay in the village.

354
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,180
That's why he left.

355
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,320
Now you're upset,

356
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,460
but I think you drove him away.

357
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,240
Father,

358
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,480
why don't you

359
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,280
give the land back?

360
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,040
I'll go to town to find Dajiao
and persuade him to return.

361
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,770
How could I possibly return it?

362
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,390
The thing is, I've already plowed

363
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,720
Tietou's land three times, three times!

364
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,820
Well, you didn't plow it for nothing.

365
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,200
What do you mean?

366
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,370
If you return the land,

367
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,120
when Tietou and his family work on it,

368
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,050
they'll surely be grateful to you.

369
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,160
I don't need his gratitude.

370
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,180
I only need my son!

371
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,610
My son!

372
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,790
Dajiao!

373
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,120
Dajiao!

374
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,260
Qing.

375
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,140
Where are you going?

376
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm heading to town. Where are you going?

377
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,440
I'm going to town too.

378
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,099
Perfect. I can give you a ride.

379
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,250
Why are you in such a hurry?

380
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,710
Did something happen at home?

381
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,119
Don't jinx it.

382
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,980
I'm just mailing a letter to Young Master.

383
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,670
This letter

384
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,180
was written by your wife,

385
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,380

386

[To Fei Wendian]

387
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,190
My wife wrote a letter to Fei Wendian?

388
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,260
What did she write?

389
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,470
Just a letter.

390
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Is Mr. Du in?

391
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,920
He's not.

392
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,250
What do you need him for?

393
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,310
Dajiao.

394
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,400
Oh, it's you.

395
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,380
You can stay here tonight.

396
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,920
Thank you.

397
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,030
When will Mr. Du be back?

398
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,960
In a day or two.

399
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,560
I'm waiting on news myself.

400
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,510
When Mr. Du returns,

401
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,920
please let me know.

402
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,250
Don't worry. I'll tell you right away.

403
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,030
This letter

404
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,530
was written by your wife,

405
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,730
Xiuxiu, herself.

406
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,550
I knew it.

407
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,250
I wasn't wrong about him.

408
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,640
A good man should have grand ambitions.

409
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,830
The moment Mr. Du walked in,

410
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,310
I could tell he was special,

411
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,680
a man of integrity.

412
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,030
If you work with him,

413
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,000
you'll surely accomplish great things.

414
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,030
I support you.

415
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,030
You have all my support.

416

417
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,460
May Xiuxiu's letter
bring Wendian back right away.

418
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,920
As long as Wendian returns,

419
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,590
the Fei family line

420
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,150

00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,720

You load it like this.

One shot, one kill. It works great.

524
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,790
Let me try it.

525
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,470
No, no, no.

526
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,680

She knows. She told me to come.

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,160

Dajiao, you're here too.

538
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,270
I came with Mr. Shen.

539
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,340
Now you see
what I've been trying to get you to do.

540
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,410
To stand up for the common folk.

541
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,240
That's right.

542
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,920
Look at this family.

543
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,310
Dajiao is enlightened.

544
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,750
His brother-in-law is a great fighter.

545
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,030
Don't you all agree?

546
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,270
Yes, indeed!

547
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,590
Catch him!

548
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,160

549
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,830
Dajiao.

550
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,620
Dajiao's been shot.
Take him to the hospital!

551
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,790
How is he?

552
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,200
The doctor says the bone's fine.

553
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,460
Unlucky, but it could've been worse.

554
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,920
For a farmer like him,

555
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,640
if his tendons or bones were damaged,

556
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
I'd never be able to make it up to him.

557
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,460
This rascal has the devil's own luck.

558
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,610
The doctor also said

559
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,410
recovery care is crucial.

560
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Commander Kejin,

561
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,400
how about this?

562
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,480
Could you ask some of your men

563
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,120
to bring Dajiao's wife here
to look after him?

564
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,210
Women are more attentive than we are.

565
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,770
Alright.

566
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,920
When Dajiao sees

567
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,070
my sister,

568
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,300
he'll heal faster.

569
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,460
I'll send someone to fetch her right away.

570
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:43,960
Good.

571
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,020
Wendian,

572
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,640
here's a letter for you.

573
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,240
Thank you.

574
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,900
No problem.

575
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,060
Good news, good news!

576
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,170
Have you all heard?

577
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,640
What happened?

578
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,240
The Qingqi Society at Guojia Fort
has won their first battle!

579
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,830
Really?

580
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,720
Yes.

581
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,620
[Return]

582
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,400
I heard

583
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,030
the Qingqi Society from Ox Temple Village
launched a surprise attack

584
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,680
and wiped out the entire security team.

585
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,240
Great!

586
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,220
They seized over 300 guns

587
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,720
and even captured the county magistrate.

588
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,350
I heard

589
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,200
Zhang Zongchang sent
so-called peace envoys

590
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,400
to negotiate a truce,

591
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,340
but the Qingqi Society
firmly refused to talk.

592
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,860
That's right. No truce!

593
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,220
Yeah.

594
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,590
Down with imperialism.

595
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,720
Down with those despicable warlords.

596
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,640
Our teacher Zhang Chuan has written

597
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,030
a special poem for this operation.

598
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,090
Really? Let's hear it.

599
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:31,480
Yes.

600
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,110
The brave men of Ox Temple Village,

601
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,770
you're soldiers from heaven.

602
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,580
You possess Napoleon's fearlessness,

603
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,640
crushing the warlords' morale.

604
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,510
You have the spirit
of the Three Kingdoms heroes.

605
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,790
With red spears and green banners,
you strike down the devils.

606
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,960
You're a lightning bolt of this era.

607
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,000
Your valor echoes

608
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
between heaven and earth.

609
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,550
Great!

610
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,110
Make way.

611
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,980
Dajiao.

612
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,630
This room.

613
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:19,970
Xiu.

614
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,540
Lie down.

615
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,770
-You're here.
-Don't move. Don't move.

616
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,200
Why did you come?

617
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,070
You're all sweaty.

618
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,350
It must hurt terribly, right?

619
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,240
I'm fine.

620
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm totally fine.

621
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,190
The bullet has been removed,

622
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,440
leaving a hole,

623
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,890
but the doctor said

624
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,200
I'll be fine after a few days' rest.

625
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,680
It won't keep me from farming later.
No big deal.

626
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,790
No big deal?

627
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,190
I heard they put in many stitches.

628
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,110
I was worried sick the whole way here.

629
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,440
Really, I'm fine. Look.

630
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,260
Don't move.

631
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,160
Does it hurt?

632
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,030
It's fine.

633
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,440
Dajiao.

634
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,770
Time for your shot.

635
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,150
Wait, wait.

636
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,980
Wait for what?

637
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,350
My wife is here.

638
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,960
So what if your wife is here?

639
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,090
Xiu, let me tell you.

640
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,770
Your brave husband here

641
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,360
isn't afraid of a gun barrel

642
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,160
but of shots and dressing changes.

643
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,630
When they were removing the bullet,

644
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,110
even with anesthesia,

645
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,490
he wailed for two hours.

646
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,030
Don't listen to your brother's nonsense.

647
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,290
T-The doctor tried
to cut me with a knife.

648
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,120
What's so scary about a shot?
I'm here with you.

649
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,580
Alright, enough talking.

650
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,640
Let's give you the shot first,
then change your dressing.

651
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,030
Take his pants off.

652
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
You're asking me to do it?

653
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,270
You're his wife.

654
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,630
If you don't, who will?

655
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,640
Hurry up!

656
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,570
This...

657
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,140
This...

658
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,000
Lower.

659
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,010
Careful.

660
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,660
[Patient activity area]

661
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,480
Xiu.

662
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,310
Having you here

663
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,270
really helps.

664
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,530
And also,

665
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,010
when you're by my side,

666
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,060
I don't feel the pain anymore.

667
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,480
Xiu.

668
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,550
On my way here,

669
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,720
I ran into Qing from the Fei family.

670
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,940
He said you wrote a letter to Fei Wendian.

671
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,400
This has been
weighing on my mind for days

672
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,110
like a heavy stone.

673
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,640
Dajiao,

674
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,510
do you trust me so little?

675
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,550
Sit down.

676
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,820
Let me explain.

677
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,240
Mrs. Fei said

678
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,960
that if Father returned the land deed,

679
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,290
she'd lease it to Tietou
for another year,

680
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,960
but on one condition:

681
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,270
I had to write a letter

682
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,370
to persuade Fei Wendian to come back.

683
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,440
It wasn't an easy letter to write,

684
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,640
but I had to do it,

685
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,070
so I just wrote one word.

686
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,750
One word?

687
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,160
To the Fei family,

688
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm now an outsider,

689
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,200
Susu's sister.

690
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,240
So I just wrote the word "return."

691
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,510
My bad.

692
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,720
I shouldn't have overthought it.

693
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,680
Dajiao.

694
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,510
We've been through so much together

695
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,200
and are of the same mind now.

696
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,570
We'll just stay with Father and Mother

697
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,730
and make a good life together.

698
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,120
Dajiao.

699
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,480
-Mr. Du.
-Mr. Du.

700
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,450
Look at you.

701
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,960
With Xiuxiu here,

702
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,350
you look much better.

703
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,120
I came to check on you.

704
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,550
Thank you.

705
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,640
How about

706
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,510
we take a walk?

707
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,340
Come on. We can walk and talk.

708
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,430
Mr. Zhang,

709
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,090
I want to take a trip home.

710
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,920
Xiuxiu wrote me a letter.

711
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,120
I want to go see her.

712
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:17,900
Also,

713
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,530
I want to sort things out
between Susu and me.

714
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,990
I can't keep

715
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,530
holding her back.

716
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,410
I fully support you going back.

717
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,860
I hope

718
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,860
you can let go of your worries.

719
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,310
I also want to remind youâ€”

720
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,880
don't rush it.

721
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,180
The fortress of feudalism

722
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,860
won't crumble overnight.

723
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,440
I understand, sir.

724
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,440
Besides,

725
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,190
this time when I go back,

726
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,450
I want to bring back the ideas
of the Farmers' Association.

727
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,610
That's excellent.

728
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
When you're back,

729
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,230
you can learn about

730
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,080
how the Farmers' Association was formed

731
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,380
and do some investigation.

732
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,900
Continue with your current tasks

733
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,970
in our group.

734
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,830
Find channels of communication

735
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
and slowly work your way in.

736
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,270
Yes.

737
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,400
I hope to settle
my personal affairs first.

738
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,480
Let the people have control
over their own new future.

739
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,170
I wish you success.

740
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I understand now.

741
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,790
Only when peace returns to this land

742
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,320
can we live a peaceful life.

743
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,350
The Farmers' Association,

744
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,390
to put it simply,
is standing up for us farmers.

745
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,020
Yes, Dajiao, well said.

746
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,280
So those wealthy landlords

747
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,170
can no longer bully us farmers.

748
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,030
How can we make sure

749
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,830
they stop bullying the farmers?

750
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,350
It's a matter of details.

751
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,610
Once Dajiao's healed,

752
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,550
I'll explain it to you properly.

753
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
Qing,

754
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,310
feed the horses later.

755
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,160
Make sure they're full

756
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,510
and can run anytime.

757
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,790
If you run out of feed,

758
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,480
get money from Beard Liu to buy more.

759
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,240
Okay, Madam.

760
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,010
Beard Liu. Beard Liu.

761
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,620
Madam.

762
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,720
Tell the kitchen

763
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,510
to prepare more food,

764
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,850
especially Young Master's favorites.

765
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,750
Prepare extra.

766
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,800
Okay, Madam.

767
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,920
Where's Xiaoqin? Xiaoqin!

768
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,880
Madam, I'm here.

769
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,000
After you finish cleaning the room,

770
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,110
take out Young Master's bedding

771
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,160
and Young Mistress's bedding

772
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,370
and air them out in the sun.

773
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,920
Young Master will be back soon.

774
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,240
Everything must be ready.

775
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,840
All right.

776
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,040
Come out now.

777
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Sister-in-law, want some sunflower seeds?

778
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
I don't want any.

779
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,350
Let me tell you something.

780
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,210
Wendian will be back soon, right?

781
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,690
I've already

782
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,310
taken care of the rent collection

783
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,720
and land distribution.

784
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,160
Next,

785
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,110
I'll help you get prepared.

786
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,700
You've already prepared everything.

787
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
I'm not the one who should get ready.

788
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,680
I mean, I'm going to help you get ready.

789
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,540
Ready for what?

790
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,830
For pregnancy and childbirth.

791
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,480
What?

792
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,140
How am I supposed to prepare for that?

793
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,050
I don't want to.

794
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,270
I've collected
many special remedies for you.

795
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,330
Everything's set.

796
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,130
But first of all,

797
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,650
you can't be running around anymore.

798
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,440
It's spring. The earth is waking up.

799
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,610
The wind is unpredictable.
You cannot catch a cold.

800
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,960
You can't eat things like this anymore.

801
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,630
For your three meals a day,

802
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,600
you'll follow the diet
I've prepared for you.

803
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,410
As for drinks,

804
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,400
I'll prepare special tonics for you.

805
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,060
I don't mind following a diet,

806
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,960
but can I see what's on it?

807
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,920
How many meals a day

808
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,160
come with meat and steamed buns?

809
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,020
Any pork steamed in lotus leaves?

810
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,800
You won't be eating meat.

811
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,610
Come on, let's go back in.

812
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,190
I'll explain everything in detail.

813
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,250
What can be more delicious than meat?

814
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,480
Mr. Du,

815
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,699
we're heading back now.

816
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,820
Alright, Dajiao,

817
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,270
take some small gifts for your family.

818
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,150
I can't accept them.

819
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,949
It's too much.

820
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,630
You've already returned the silver dollars

821
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,630
that Mr. Du gave you.

822
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,530
These small gifts
are nothing in comparison.

823
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,929
Just a token of goodwill.

824
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,440
Dajiao,

825
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,880
the stitches were just removed.

826
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,679
The nurse said

827
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
you should avoid stretching the wound,

828
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,460
keep it dry,

829
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,230
and make sure it heals properly.

830
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,630
Okay.

831
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,710
Get on the cart.

832
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,310
Thank you.

833
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:39,920
Hurry up.

834
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,590
I'm heading back.

835
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:40,960
Okay.

836
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:42,920
Here.

837
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,590
Boys,

838
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,280
look sharp.

839
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,489
We're going home!

840
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:48,960
Alright!

841
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,330
Heading home!

842
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,320
Farewell, Mr. Du.

843
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,550
Kejin, be careful on the road.

844
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,949
I will.

845
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,630
Why did you change my pillow?

846
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,630
That pillow is really comfortable.

847
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,100
This new pillow I gave you

848
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,400
has dried orange peels inside.

849
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,760
Madam Liu from the front village
told me

850
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,270
it's a secret remedy from her family.

851
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,550
In her second year of marriage,

852
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,070
she gave birth to a chubby baby boy.

853
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,230
The next year was even betterâ€”

854
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,800
she had twin boys.

855
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,470
Just the other day, she sent word

856
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,960
that she's pregnant again.

857
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,160
T-This pillow can do black magic.

858
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,670
Smell it.

859
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,510
Let me tell you something.

860
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,360
Actually,

861
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,840
the orange peels,
when smelled for a long time,

862
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,550
make couples want to get intimate.

863
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,940
The more you do,
the more likely you'll have a baby.

864
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,060
Silly girl.

865
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,000
Those moves I taught you,

866
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,110
have you practiced them today?

867
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,840
I had lye buns and lye porridge

868
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,000
for breakfast.

869
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,110
They were so bitter and astringent
that I couldn't eat them,

870
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,630
so I've got no strength to practice.

871
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,350
If you can't eat, you're not hungry.
Practice now.

872
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,440
After you practice, you'll be hungry,
and then you can eat.

873
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Hurry, practice.

874
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,560
Do I really have to do 50?

875
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,720
Can't I just do five?

876
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,230
You think five will work up an appetite?

877
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,760
50.

878
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
What's squatting got to do
with having a baby?

879
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,920
The midwife told me

880
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,880
this strengthens your lower body,

881
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,320
so no matter how big the baby,

882
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
you'll be able to deliver it.

883
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,470
Why are you sitting on the floor?

884
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,390
Every time I tell you to practice,
you start whining.

885
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,940
Come on.

886
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,070
Practice.

887
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,270
I'll have them heat up some food for you.

888
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,030
50.

889
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,880
When I get back, I'm going to check.

890
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,140
If you're not sweaty, you'll do it again.

891
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,200
Hurry up.

892
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,190
I'm not doing that.

893
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,360
What's all that noise about?

894
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,480
Sounds like they've stopped
at our doorstep.

895
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,920
Yes.

896
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,320
Those of the Feng family,

897
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,870
come out now!

898
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,150
Come out!

899
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,970
Put me down! Put me down!

900
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,850
Put me down!

901
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,440
Stop!

902
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,110
Son.

903
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,070
What's wrong with you?

904
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:41,710
I'm fine, Mother.

905
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,480
He's fine!

906
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,880
He's become a great hero!

907
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,690
Everyone, come inside.

908
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,480
I'll tell you all
about how my brother-in-law

909
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,360
became a great hero.

910
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,150
Let's go!

911
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,030
Put me down.

912
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,920
My head, my head.

913
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,150
In the blink of an eye,

914
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,320
this guy fired his gun.

915
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,110
My brother-in-law reacted so quickly.

916
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,960
"Watch out!"

917
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,450
The two of them dropped at the same time.

918
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,710
That's when I jumped in quick,

919
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,950
rolled over, and loaded my gun.

920
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:27,920
Great!

921
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,580
Great!

922
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,510
Have some water.

923
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,760
I shot him dead.

924
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,200
We couldn't care about anything else.

925
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,730
I hurried to get Mr. Du
and my brother-in-law

926
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,040
up on their feet.

927
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,670
Guess who got hurt?

928
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Dajiao, my son.

929
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,630
Yes! My brother-in-law was injured.

930
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,850
When I checked on him,

931
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,790
my hands were covered in blood.

932
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,560
Grandpa Ox must have been

933
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,080
protecting him.

934
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,670
The bullet didn't hit any bone.

935
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,480
It just grazed the skin a bit.

936
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,960
Is it better? Let me see the wound.

937
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
No need to look.

938
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,900
Mr. Du took my brother-in-law

939
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,530
to the best hospital in town.

940
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,670
A foreign doctor performed surgery

941
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
and removed the bullet right away.

942
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,350
It's all stitched up now.

943
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,310
And my sister

944
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,710
has learned

945
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,370
how to change his dressings.

946
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,640
Tell me, isn't my brother-in-law a hero?

947
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,280
Yes, he's a hero.

948
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,920
A hero, a hero, a hero!

949
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,140
Impressive! Impressive!

950
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,420
I've returned safely.

951
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,760
The boys are tired after a long day.

952
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,160
Let's dismiss everyone.

953
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,670
I don't have any money on me.

954
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,670
Could you buy some good food
and drinks to treat everyone?

955
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,710
Of course.

956
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,340
I'll do whatever my brother-in-law asks.

957
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,460
My brother-in-law is a hero!

958
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:35,950
Great!

959
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,520
Let's go.

960
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,590
Go on, go, go.

961
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,250
We're leaving. Thanks, hero.

962
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Come on, let's go.

963
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,590
Xiu, I'm leaving.

964
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
Change the dressing on time.

965
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,190
Let's go.

966
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,400
Xiu, hurry.

967
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,330
Take him inside.

968
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,050
Careful now.

969
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,000
Let him lie down.

970
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Okay, Mother,

971
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,150
I'm fine.

972
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,800
They left just like that?

973
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,760
He almost died!

974
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,820
There's got to be some compensation,

975
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,520
like 30 or 50 silver dollars.

976
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,610
It's all because of you!

977
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,510
If you don't sort out that land issue,

978
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,720
Dajiao will have to leave again.

979
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,200
H-He wouldn't dare.

980
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,710
Xiu.

981
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,100
Thank you for taking care of me

982
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,590
these days.

983
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,430
Even the nurse said

984
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,960
I married

985
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
an angel of a wife.

986
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,970
That's just what they said.

987
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,510
What do you think?

988
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,360
I think you're

989
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,650
even better than an angel.

990
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
When you said

991
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,840
you'd never leave me again

992
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,170
and that you wanted to live a good life

993
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,280
with my parents and me,

994
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,030
you meant it, didn't you?

995
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,510
Of course I meant it.

996
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,890
At first, I married you in a fit of anger

997
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,690
because you saved me.

998
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,840
I feel safe when I'm with you.

999
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,600
But after I married you, I realized

1000
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,710
you and I were practically strangers.

1001
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,440
What happened when we were kids

1002
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,610
wasn't enough reason for you
to risk your life saving me.

1003
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,030
But you cared about my feelings,

1004
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,630
thought about my pain,

1005
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,550
and never forced me

1006
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,440
or mistreated me.

1007
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,440
That gave me time

1008
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,840
to get to know you bit by bit.

1009
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,480
I came to know your kindness.

1010
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,310
I came to know your abilities

1011
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,590
and how good you are to me.

1012
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,030
Others say you married an angel.

1013
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,730
But really, I'm the lucky one.

1014
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,550
You are my rock.

1015
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,850
Looks like
marrying into your family in anger

1016
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,410
was the best decision I ever made.

1017
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,780
I've never felt

1018
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,590
this secure in my whole life.
