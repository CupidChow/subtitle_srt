00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,930
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,229
I want my Silly Tiao back!

4
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:45,789
Silly Tiao...

5
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,920
I'll go get a doctor.

6
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,560
I'll go get a doctor.

7
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,259
Good for you, young man.

8
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,930
You can cut more firewood than me now.

9
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,590
Kela,

10
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,360
come here.

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,430
Sir, that woman was a dunderhead.

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,200
That explains it.

13
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,910
Let's go.

14
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,490
Keep up.

15
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,760
Careful.

16
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,870
Silly Tiao!

17
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,190
Silly Tiao!

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,550
Silly Tiao!

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,560
Silly Tiao!

20
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,400
Silly Tiao, wake up!

21
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,250
Silly Tiao!

22
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,390
Silly Tiao...

23
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,710
Mother! Mother!

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,430
Mother.

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,060
Silly Tiao!

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,190
Mother!

27
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,520
Silly Tiao, Silly Tiao!

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,800
Mother!

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,680
Silly Tiao!

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,150
Mother...

31
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,350
Don't worry about me.

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,800
Check on Silly Tiao.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,079
Your mother is fine.

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,290
But I'm afraid Tiao won't make it.

35
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,590
-Mother, Mother!
-Xiuxiu has left to get a doctor.

36
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,710
Mother, hang in there.

37
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,560
Mother, open your eyes!

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,430
Silly Tiao is dead...

39
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,140
Mother!

40
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,150
Those Japanese...

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Mother!

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Tietou's mother...

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,630
Tietou! Tietou!

44
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,910
You can't go.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,630
If you do see me as your brother,

46
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,630
then don't try to stop me!

47
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,150
Tietou!

48
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,000
Step out of this place,

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
and you won't come back alive.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,870
Don't you care about your mother anymore?

51
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,840
I must kill those Japanese!

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,490
Though Silly Tiao was a dumb cluck,

53
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,470
she gave birth to Kela

54
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,730
and treated me with all her heart.

55
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,240
But those Japanese just killed her.

56
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,520
I swear

57
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,680
to avenge her!

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,280
Tietou!

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,570
Listen to me.

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,490
If you kill those Japanese,

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,860
won't their fellows
slaughter the entire village?

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,290
But what about Silly Tiao's death?

63
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,410
As long as we're alive,

64
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
we'll be able to

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,490
avenge her someday.

66
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,840
We definitely will.

67
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,440
My hatred for the Japanese
was no less than Tietou's.

68
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,200
I felt a strong urge to lead him
and the other young men in the village

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,540
to join the Eighth Route Army

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,590
and Mr. Du

71
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,360
in fighting against the Japanese.

72
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,750
But I knew

73
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,240
that wasn't the right time.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,660
I must stop Tietou
from getting himself killed.

75
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,000
Before long,

76
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,220
we started to hear

77
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,130
good news from the battlefield.

78
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,010
Under the leadership of
the Communist Party,

79
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,800
the soldiers and civilians
in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,460
had the Japanese by the throat

81
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,980
and broke their railways,

82
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,560
leaving them in a quandary.

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,270
Our guerrillas and militias

84
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,170
kept marching on like ever-growing crops.

85
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,350
The morale was rising and rising.

86
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,540
I knew fairly well

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,920
that if needed,

88
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,650
I'd also be ready to fight the Japanese
till my last breath,

89
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,980
with a hoe in one hand
and a gun in the other.

90
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,040
Those Japanese are truly inhuman.

91
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,070
I'm very afraid.

92
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,110
Look at my sister-in-law.

93
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,970
Her mental state is never stable.

94
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,820
I have to keep her from going out.

95
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,750
It must be hard for the two of you
to live through

96
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,280
all these difficult times.

97
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,970
Whether it's day or night,

98
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,430
remember to lock the door.

99
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,910
I know.

100
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,950
Xiuxiu,

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,260
I know what you want to ask.

102
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,510
He had a message delivered to me
two months ago.

103
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,170
Since then,

104
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,240
I haven't heard from him again.

105
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,120
Isn't he said to be

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,320
hauling artillery for the Kuomintang?

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
Why is it taking so long?

108
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,040
Dajiao and I

109
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,870
are worried about him too.

110
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,510
Dajiao even made inquiries
through someone.

111
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,440
But there hasn't been a final word.

112
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,690
Humpback Guo has been away for so long.

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,980
It's very concerning.

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,510
He's a really

115
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,800
tough guy,

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,070
like an antâ€”

117
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,920
if a car ran him over,

118
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,870
he'd just get up, dust himself off

119
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,670
and continue to live and move on.

120
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
I'm glad you think it that way.

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,830
I refrained myself from asking you,

122
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,390
though I was worried sick.

123
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,050
You've really grown up, Susu.

124
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,190
Xiuxiu,

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,690
to be more accurate,

126
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,690
I've grown old.

127
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,130
Some women at my age

128
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,830
have already become grandmothers,

129
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,560
while I'm carrying my first child.

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,190
I can't conceal my pregnancy anymore.

131
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,000
I have to wear a large coat
to cover my ugly belly.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Ugly?

133
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,940
Nonsense.

134
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,570
Mothers are never ugly.

135
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,190
Xiuxiu,

136
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,070
I just want to keep my pregnancy secret

137
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,300
from Mrs. Fei.

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,860
If she finds it out,

139
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,880
she'll surely be upset for a while.

140
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,430
But I don't think

141
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,690
you can hide it for too long.

142
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,560
If you can't stay
in the Fei Residence anymore,

143
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,620
go to our father's.

144
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
If that doesn't work, come to me.

145
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,360
I promise

146
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,870
I'll take good care of you,

147
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,690
so you can wait for Humpback Guo's return
with your mind at ease.

148
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,680
Xiuxiu,

149
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,159
I have a hunch

150
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,000
that he'll come back one day.

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I believe he will.

152
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,120
Dajiao and I

153
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,050
will clean up the side room for you.

154
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,870
Taking care of you

155
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,960
will keep my worries at bay.

156
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,040
Don't you think so,

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
little baby?

158
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,510
Look.

159
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,630
Auntie made you a shirt.

160
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,630
How do you like it?

161
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,890
We'll put it on you after you're born.

162
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,270
Say something.

163
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,400
Thank your aunt now.

164
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,690
Come on, say thank you.

165
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,880
You're welcome.

166
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,750
Haven't forgotten me, have you?

167
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,510
Humpback Guo,

168
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,900
how could I have forgotten you?

169
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,290
Do you know
what I've been through these days?

170
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,890
I thought you had drowned
and become fish food!

171
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,610
I was captured by the Kuomintang
to haul artillery.

172
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,490
I truly thought I'd never make it back.

173
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,080
Bombs exploded right by my ears every day.

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,650
Shrapnel tore arms and legs

175
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,200
apart from people.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,840
But every day, as I woke up,

177
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
I'd tell myself

178
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,190
that I must not die there.

179
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,910
If I am to die,

180
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,980
I'll have to die where you are.

181
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
What's that nonsense?

182
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,860
You're already back. No more death talk.

183
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,690
How did you manage to come back?

184
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,120
The troops were moving again.

185
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,630
I seized a chance

186
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,360
to quickly

187
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,670
roll into a trench

188
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,040
and hide among some dead bodies.

189
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,150
I lay there for a whole day.

190
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,770
I dared not move at all,

191
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,570
in case anyone found me alive.

192
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,480
Then, as night fell,

193
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,690
I sensed I was left alone there,

194
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,000
so I...

195
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,550
I finally made it back...

196
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,020
alive.

197
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,850
Why are you staring?

198
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,610
You're beautiful.

199
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,780
I can't get my eyes off you.

200
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,750
I missed you so much.

201
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,030
I won't let you

202
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,870
leave me again.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,130
I won't go anywhere.

204
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,170
I'll never part with you again.

205
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,350
Even death can't separate us.

206
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,360
It's my baby?

207
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,700
Do you even need to ask?

208
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,980
I'm going to be a father?

209
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,380
I was thinking about going out

210
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,540
to do business
so I could make enough money to marry you.

211
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,310
But I haven't earned a penny yet.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,260
I'll marry you even if you're penniless.

213
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,180
Tomorrow,
I'll ask your father for your hand

214
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,480
in marriage.

215
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,750
I'll go with you.

216
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,720
Humpback Guo

217
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,030
suddenly came back.

218
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,980
It all seems like a dream to me.

219
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,310
How is that?

220
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,660
It should be Humpback Guo's dream instead.

221
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,720
He's making a marriage proposal so soon.

222
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,250
When this room is tidied up,

223
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,910
he can live here with his pregnant wife.

224
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,670
How wonderful.

225
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,200
Mother,

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,720
what will be Auntie's baby's surname,

227
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,910
Fei or Guo?

228
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,070
It'll be Ning.

229
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,570
Your brother's joking.

230
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,690
Auntie's baby's surname will be Guo.

231
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,670
This baby has nothing to do
with the Fei family.

232
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,270
Your aunt lives in the Fei Residence

233
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,270
only to take care of Mrs. Fei.

234
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,150
Mother, I don't understand.

235
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,670
Why do I have Father's surname

236
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,960
instead of yours?

237
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,030
What now?

238
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,530
Is your ancestors' surname
not good enough for you?

239
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,090
Whatever your surname is,

240
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,360
Father and Mother
treasure you all the same.

241
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,510
Right, Jiaming?

242
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,710
Mother, then my name will be
Ning Jiaying from now on.

243
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,840
Ning Jiaying?

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,030
Ask your father if he agrees.

245
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,270
Don't fret.

246
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,710
Just speak your mind.

247
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,210
Here's tea!

248
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,880
Glad to see you back.

249
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,830
Have some tea.

250
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Thank you.

251
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,670
Stay for dinner, alright?

252
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,670
I'll cook.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,480
Father.

254
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,550
No.

255
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,000
Mr. Ning,

256
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,050
I, Guo Guiyao, am paying you a visit.

257
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,810
Leather shoes.

258
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,390
Father,

259
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,480
Humpback Guo has something to say.

260
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,390
Say it.

261
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,150
I meant to send a matchmaker over
for this marriage proposal,

262
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,150
but then I thought

263
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
it would be better if I did it myself.

264
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,030
I brought some snacks

265
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,380
for Young Master Keyu.

266
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,010
Maybe he can try them later.

267
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,040
Humpback Guo, good for you.

268
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,080
You were away for six months.

269
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,480
The moment you're back,

270
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,870
you're asking to marry my daughter.

271
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I...

272
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,080
disagree.

273
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,320
Father,

274
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,650
what's the matter now?

275
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,720
Didn't you tell Yinzi

276
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,150
that you hoped to see Humpback Guo back

277
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,440
and marry me off to him?

278
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
I did say that,

279
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,870
but not to his face.

280
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,680
I can't talk like that when he's around.

281
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,550
Come on, sit here.

282
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,030
Take the seat next to me.

283
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,830
I'm doing this for your own good.

284
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,390
No.

285
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,670
If you treat him with hostility,

286
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,330
I'll leave with him right now.

287
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,550
I'll make sure

288
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,080
you never see your grandchild.

289
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,000
Susu...

290
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,720
He's destitute.

291
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,710
You'll live in poverty if you marry him.

292
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,470
You have money.

293
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,670
Why not give him some?

294
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,760
Look at that!

295
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
Would a daughter ask her father
for dowry this way?

296
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,120
Besides,

297
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,250
wealthy though I am,

298
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,620
does he know how to farm

299
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,370
if I give him a few mu of land?

300
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,710
Humpback Guo,

301
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,130
do you know how to farm?

302
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,650
I'm acting in your best interests, Susu.

303
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,410
If he can afford proper betrothal gifts,

304
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,870
at least you and your baby
will have a decent life

305
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,160
after you marry him.

306
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,080
Mr. Ning, you're right.

307
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,720
It's true that I don't know how to farm,

308
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,200
but I've figured out a plan.

309
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,330
I promise I'll learn from Feng Dajiao,

310
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,320
my future brother-in-law,

311
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,310
with the will to start from scratch.

312
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,000
I'd rather let myself suffer

313
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,950
than starve Susu and the baby.

314
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,160
Doesn't my daughter deserve
more than a meal?

315
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,550
She was well fed and clothed

316
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,600
when I raised her.

317
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,720
Take Keyu as an example.

318
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,130
What does he eat and drink?

319
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,550
What school does he go to?

320
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,440
My way is the right way to raise a family.

321
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,060
Yes, of course.

322
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,370
You think I'd have respect for you

323
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,750
because you're wearing leather shoes?

324
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,080
You own nothing.

325
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,600
I'd rather keep my daughter
and grandchild around,

326
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
so I can provide for them myself.

327
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,750
Mr. Ning,

328
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,320
what are you saying?

329
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,840
How can I let you

330
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,570
provide for my woman and child?

331
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,630
You've really underestimated me.

332
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,600
I've been a merchant for over 20 years.

333
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,840
I've seen everything.

334
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,640
Why do you have to look down on me?

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,840
What now?

336
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,150
You want

337
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,040
a fight with me?

338
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,750
Humpback Guo, what are you doing?

339
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't try to stop me, Susu.

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,870
Since your father has put it that way,

341
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,530
I won't show him any courtesy!

342
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,440
What's your plan?

343
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,840
You...

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,330
Get me a brush and paper.

345
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,960
For what?

346
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,200
You want to write in your blood?

347
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,660
I mean for you to write down

348
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,670
a list of

349
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,750
betrothal gifts.

350
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
In one year, or three at most,

351
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,950
you'll receive them!

352
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,080
Is it true?

353
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm a man of my word.

354
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,330
You have my promise.

355
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,680
I'll start writing then, Humpback Guo.

356
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,720
Keep this in mindâ€”

357
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,030
you're marrying my daughter,

358
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,010
the finest girl for miles around.

359
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,160
Just you wait!

360
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,339
Why did you have to create that tension?

361
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,950
Father, stop it. He can't afford anything.

362
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,190
What's that nonsense, Susu?

363
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,440
Trust me.

364
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,510
It's just about making money, isn't it?

365
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,619
That's what I've spent

366
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,950
half my life working on.

367
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,030
If it weren't for the Japanese,

368
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,510
I would've become
one of the richest men in the village!

369
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,040
Mr. Ning, write it all down.

370
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,720
I'll laugh at you

371
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
if you don't make a long enough list!

372
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,720
Shut up, you.

373
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,340
[Farming is the only way
to sustain a family]

374
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,960
Mr. Ning!

375
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,110
Father,

376
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
well noted!

377
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,940
Time to cook, Yinzi.

378
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,590
Jiaming, Kela!

379
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,920
All the kids,

380
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,710
take your tools with you.

381
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,270
The Japanese aren't around now.

382
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,400
I'll teach you how to grow sorghum

383
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
on the Turtle Hill today.

384
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,240
-Okay?
-Okay.

385
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,720
Where is Keyu?

386
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,630
Is he not here?

387
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,680
He is. I saw him just now.

388
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,720
Keyu!

389
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,380
Where is he?

390
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,000
Uncle said

391
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,730
he had to skip the outing

392
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,160
since he didn't feel well.

393
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,920
Skip?

394
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,930
Where is he now?

395
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,070
He's reading in the room.

396
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,200
Keyu!

397
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,310
Keyu!

398
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,880
Why won't you go to the fields with us?

399
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
Do you feel sick or what?

400
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,920
Maybe I can be of help.

401
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,240
Can't you just tell my father
I've worked the fields?

402
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,750
Why do you have to drag me into it?

403
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,110
I'm not cut out for farming,

404
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,170
and I don't like it.

405
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,700
I'm not going with you.

406
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,720
Keyu,

407
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,040
come here.

408
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,650
Give me the book.

409
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,590
No.

410
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,510
You rascal.

411
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,210
Will you go farming or not?

412
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,740
Don't beat him.

413
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,550
Why can't I?

414
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,310
Someone has to correct his mistakes.

415
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,320
You...

416
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,040
Come over.

417
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Nobody is born a natural for farming.

418
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,480
The skills are to be acquired.

419
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,310
When you get home, tell your parents

420
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,510
that I beat you today.

421
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,590
Ask them if what I did was right.

422
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,930
Give me their answer tomorrow.
Do you hear me?

423
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,950
Alright. Time to set off.

424
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's go farming.

425
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,720
Go.

426
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,750
Guys, go!

427
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,720
Dajiao!

428
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,390
What's up?

429
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Give this book back to him later.

430
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,920
Tell him

431
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,440
I bought him a few more.

432
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,920
I've learned this trick.

433
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,270
It's a carrot-and-stick approach.

434
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,690
Come back early.

435
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,980
We need to
clean up the side room for Susu.

436
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,590
Got it.

437
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,840
Bye, Mother.

438
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,070
Where are your manners?

439
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,510
One shouldn't raise a hand to an outsider.

440
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,810
Have you forgotten that?

441
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,070
Keyu is my younger brother,
not an outsider.

442
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,320
He should be disciplined by your father.

443
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,830
My father can't bring himself
to lay a hand on Keyu.

444
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,660
It has to be done by me.

445
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,860
But you've never hit Jiaming even once.

446
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,080
How could you hit Keyu?

447
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,800
Mother,

448
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,550
Dajiao is disciplining Jiaming

449
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,480
for both of us.

450
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,590
By contrast,

451
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,180
Keyu has been spoiled
by my father and Yinzi,

452
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,490
so I had to teach him a lesson.

453
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,860
Yinzi wouldn't mind.

454
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,920
My father will figure it out sometime.

455
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,050
I'll prepare lunch!

456
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,240
Look at that.

457
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,200
Did you see?

458
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,270
You must behave.

459
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,590
Sweetheart,

460
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,020
be a good girl.

461
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,370
You have a formidable mother.

462
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,390
She's even tougher than a teacher.

463
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,520
Don't mess with her.

464
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,680
What's with your belly?

465
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,680
Are you pregnant?

466
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Who's the father?

467
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,350
Who?

468
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,170
Sister-in-law,

469
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
I'm pregnant with Guo Guiyao's child.

470
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,440
He has asked my father
for my hand in marriage.

471
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,750
I'll marry him soon.

472
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,270
But you are Wendian's wife.

473
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,270
How could you be knocked up
by another man?

474
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,350
"Knocked up"?

475
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,750
That's very rude!

476
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,660
Wendian already passed away.

477
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,750
You know it best.

478
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,720
On the day I married into the Fei family,

479
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,790
Wendian said I was a victim
of this marriage.

480
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,920
He always hoped for me
to have my own life.

481
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,680
Why are you...

482
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,880
acting like you're unaware of all that?

483
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,200
You belong here forever

484
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,330
since you married into the Fei family!

485
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,640
How could you trample on
our family's dignity like this?

486
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,390
The Fei family's reputation...

487
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,680
I've spent my entire life guarding it,

488
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,340
but it's all ruined now...

489
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,610
This is an illegitimate child.

490
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,220
You can't keep it. You can't.

491
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,680
Why can't I keep my baby?

492
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm carrying Guo Guiyao's child now.

493
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,090
Why must I obey the stupid rules

494
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,720
of the Fei family like you do?

495
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,480
I came back to keep you company
because I'm worried about you.

496
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,400
Change your attitude,

497
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,730
or I won't stay with you!

498
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,920
Where are you going?

499
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,240
You can't leave.

500
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,240
You belong to the Fei family.

501
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,830
What are you doing?

502
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,720
You belong here.

503
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,510
You can't go anywhere!

504
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,550
What are you doing, Sister-in-law?

505
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,480
Come with me to the ancestral hall,

506
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,240
where you'll kowtow and apologize.

507
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,510
Okay!

508
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,200
Repent of your sins!

509
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes, Sister-in-law, I'll do it!

510
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,790
But can you leave me alone for a moment?

511
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,390
Maybe I'll think it through
and choose to stay.

512
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,550
Sister-in-law,

513
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,610
you go there first.

514
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,920
Go ahead.

515
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,570
I'll be with you shortly.

516
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,350
I'll kowtow to the ancestors
for their forgiveness.

517
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,280
I'll kowtow to the ancestors
for their forgiveness.

518
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
How horrifying.

519
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,480
I can't stay here anymore.

520
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,790
I must leave.

521
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,350
What should I do?

522
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,920
What should I do?

523
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,270
[In loving memory of
my husband Fei Wendian]

524
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,680
I disgraced the entire Fei family.

525
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,750
Susu did such a shameless thing

526
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,310
right under my nose.

527
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,350
I've failed...

528
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,720
I've failed all the Fei ancestors.

529
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

530
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,790
What is there to do?

531
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,310
The baby...

532
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,200
must disappear.

533
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,310
It must disappear!

534
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,550
It must.

535
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,680
Where are you going?

536
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,960
Sister-in-law,

537
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm going home.

538
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,680
After my baby is born,

539
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,540
I'll come back to take care of you.

540
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,510
You've married into the Fei family.

541
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,510
You're our daughter-in-law forever.

542
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,400
I won't let you go. Come back.

543
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,350
I don't belong here.

544
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,350
Come to the ancestral hall with me.

545
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,510
I won't let you go out
and humiliate the family.

546
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,400
Come with me!

547
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,480
Sister-in-law!

548
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,090
Sister-in-law,

549
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,880
I think I'm in labor.

550
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,680
Sister-in-law, get a midwife for me.

551
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,140
Tell my sister to come.

552
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
G-Get Humpback Guo here too.

553
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,750
You can't have this baby.

554
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,720
You can't.

555
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,620
Sister-in-law...

556
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,750
Push harder! Push!

557
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,640
It won't work if you don't push hard.

558
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,880
Push, now!

559
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,640
Take a breath.

560
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,510
Breathe.

561
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,780
Take a deep breath.

562
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,410
Breathe.

563
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,590
Sister-in-law!

564
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,030
Push!

565
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,720
I want my sister here!

566
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,650
Humpback Guo too, Sister-in-law!

567
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,090
I-I've informed them.

568
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,720
I've had someone go get them.

569
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,160
Madam Fei,

570
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,880
come help me now.

571
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,510
I need help. Come!

572
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,320
Hold Susu's legs.

573
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,170
Be quick!

574
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,340
Push some more.

575
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,240
I can see the baby's head!

576
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,070
Push again! Harder!

577
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,640
Push!

578
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,370
You're doing great.

579
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,680
It's going well.

580
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,350
Push!

581
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,350
Push!

582
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,760
Keep pushing.

583
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,550
Push!

584
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,430
What a beautiful little girl.

585
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,270
Though she was born two weeks early,

586
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,240
she seems quite sturdy.

587
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,340
Be careful. Keep yourself warm.

588
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,110
Madam,

589
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,220
congrats.
The young mistress just had a baby girl!

590
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,310
She's not.

591
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,240
Madam,

592
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,830
how will I be paid? By you or...

593
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,820
Thank you!

594
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,160
Is she

595
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,520
really not Wendian's daughter?

596
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,930
Sister-in-law,

597
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,530
you're confused again.

598
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,540
This is Humpback Guo's daughter.

599
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,590
Susu!

600
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,830
Did you...

601
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,810
Did you just give birth?

602
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,950
I thought you hadn't got the news yet.

603
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,760
I went to buy brown sugar.

604
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,030
Can't let the wind in.

605
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,820
It's a girl.

606
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,580
Let me hold her.

607
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,510
But how?

608
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,920
Be careful.

609
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,640
Mind her head.

610
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,780
Let me check her back.

611
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
Is it flat?

612
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,550
It is flat!

613
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,890
Her back's flat!

614
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Lower your voice.

615
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,750
My little girl.

616
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,440
This is our daughter.

617
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,240
I have my own child now!

618
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,440
I promised to be with you in labor,

619
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,700
but I ate my word again.

620
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,550
That said, you arrived first.

621
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,830
Look.

622
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,530
Does she look like you or me?

623
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,000
You.

624
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,070
Her big eyes are exactly like yours.

625
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,330
I'm glad that she doesn't take after you.

626
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,270
Mrs. Fei,

627
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,720
I came as soon as I heard!

628
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,050
Susu gave birth, right?

629
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Yes, she did.

630
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,240
Did something go wrong?

631
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,750
In the Fei family,

632
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,240
nothing can go wrong.

633
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,440
Susu!

634
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,070
Xiuxiu!

635
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,100
Xiuxiu.

636
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,400
Sweetheart,

637
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,750
say hi to your aunt.

638
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,450
I just fed her. She's a good eater.

639
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,350
Susu,

640
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,720
I already cleaned up
the side room for you.

641
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,280
Pack your things and leave with me.

642
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,960
Xiuxiu,

643
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,550
I just had a baby.

644
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,000
Won't I catch a chill if I move now?

645
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,200
Why do I have to leave?

646
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,090
There's lightning and thunder outside.

647
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,660
I think it's going to rain.

648
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
When I arrived,

649
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,040
I saw your carriage by the door.

650
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,270
Go get it prepared.

651
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,630
We'll leave before it rains.

652
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,700
-Let me hold the baby.
-Okay.

653
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,270
Come on.

654
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,070
Careful.

655
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,680
Auntie's going to hold you.

656
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,440
Alright.

657
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,830
Hurry up.

658
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,070
What's wrong, Xiuxiu?

659
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,640
Why do we have to leave now?

660
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,480
When I reached here,

661
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,790
I saw Mrs. Fei.

662
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,030
I'm concerned.

663
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,340
Just do as I say.

664
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,030
Okay.

665
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,680
I'll pack my things.

666
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,760
The carriage is ready.

667
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,640
Why are you bundled up like a dumpling?

668
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,350
Mind your tongue.

669
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,680
Hop on my back. Careful.

670
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,680
Sister-in-law!

671
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,850
Are you okay in there, Sister-in-law?

672
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,530
I'll go check on her.

673
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,880
Don't go.

674
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,110
It's going to rain.

675
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,070
Leave with me now. Don't catch a chill.

676
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,530
Xiuxiu,

677
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,720
I have to go check on her.

678
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,520
Please don't.

679
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,070
Alright. Don't worry.

680
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,790
Off you go.

681
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,750
Don't let the rain get on the baby.

682
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,110
But...

683
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,790
We'll be right with you!

684
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,240
Make it quick! Take care of Susu!

685
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,760
Sister-in-law!

686
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,720
Slowly.

687
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,660
Go ahead. See if she's fine.

688
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,280
Sister-in-law!

689
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,160
Mrs. Fei.

690
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,640
Are you all right?

691
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,790
Destroyed.

692
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
All is destroyed.

693
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,310
The Fei family

694
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,200
is destroyed.

695
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,890
Sister-in-law,

696
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
how is the Fei family destroyed?

697
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,640
You're still here, aren't you?

698
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,440
That's right.

699
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,440
I'm not counted in.

700
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,160
Not counted in?

701
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,720
How could you say that?

702
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,960
The Fei family wouldn't have
achieved so much

703
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,820
without your management, right?

704
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Where's the baby?

705
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,400
Taken away,

706
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,880
by her aunt.

707
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,970
We'll be leaving soon as well.

708
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,440
Don't you worry, Mrs. Fei.

709
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,970
We'll come visit you again.

710
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,590
Alright?

711
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,830
Good.

712
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,310
Yes, Sister-in-law.

713
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,100
I'll often come visit you.

714
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,160
No need.

715
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,480
Why?

716
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,630
You don't want to see me anymore?

717
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,350
It won't be easy

718
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,960
for us to meet up again.

719
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,830
I'll go cook for you.

720
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,350
Let this meal

721
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,780
be a proper goodbye.

722
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,830
Don't bother.

723
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,980
We can't dine with you today.
Maybe next time.

724
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,160
We're just relieved to see you're fine.

725
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,480
There's lightning outside.

726
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,030
Susu had better not
get caught in the rain.

727
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,960
We have to go now.

728
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,480
When you're gone,

729
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,350
I'll be gone too.

730
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,380
I'll live with
my brother and nephew hereafter.

731
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,470
Let's dine

732
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
for one last time.

733
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,900
Wait for me.

734
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,240
Xiu!

735
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,960
Why did you bring the baby back?

736
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,420
The baby is fine in my arms.

737
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,520
Where are Humpback Guo and Susu?

738
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,750
They'll be here soon!

739
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,970
I'm all good.

740
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,510
The roof of the side room

741
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,310
is leaking!

742
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,570
I'll fix it right away!

743
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,090
Okay.

744
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,150
Go inside!

745
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,550
I don't think we should eat here.

746
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,680
Let's leave.

747
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,930
Your sister must be worried.

748
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,010
I miss our little girl.

749
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,210
Sit down.

750
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,190
It's cold. Wait a second.

751
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,320
Sister-in-law said

752
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,060
after I left,

753
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,970
she'd move in with her brother

754
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,890
and nephew.

755
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,130
They'll take care of her.

756
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,130
Who knows when we will meet up again?

757
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,500
Won't it be too cruel to her

758
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,030
if we don't dine with her?

759
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,710
Fine.

760
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,739
It's pouring rain anyway.

761
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,440
I'm just...

762
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,719
I'm just worried about you.

763
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,199
You jumped into this mess

764
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,690
right after giving birth.

765
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,489
Be friendly and grab a bite.

766
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,760
There's meat.

767
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,360
Mrs. Fei.

768
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,440
I made porridge

769
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,410
with red dates.

770
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,850
It helps Susu recover.

771
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,400
You haven't eaten anything today, right?

772
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,510
Eat with Susu.

773
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,550
How capable of you, Mrs. Fei.

774
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,360
You managed to cook meat

775
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,160
for Susu in this difficult time.

776
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,520
Sister-in-law,

777
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,550
to be frank,

778
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,450
the red date porridge you make
is my favorite.

779
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm a bit hungry now.

780
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,150
Eat it then.

781
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,620
Have as much as you can.

782
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,230
I'd like to take this opportunity

783
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,590
to wish you two

784
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,400
a better and better life.

785
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,530
Thank you, Mrs. Fei.

786
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,080
What are we waiting for? Let's eat!

787
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,670
Enjoy.

788
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,590
It's too hot!

789
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:56,960
Blow onto it.

790
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,110
I like it warm.

791
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,930
Have some meat.

792
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,320
Jiaying,

793
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,110
are your father and brother
still mending the roof?

794
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,280
They went out to get wheat straws.

795
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,440
Mother,

796
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,320
my mind

797
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,030
is still unsettled.

798
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,360
I have to go to the Fei Residence.

799
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,670
Don't go. Let Dajiao do it instead.

800
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,380
Mother,

801
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,150
watch the baby for me.

802
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,150
It's raining. Be careful!

803
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,110
Susu!

804
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,630
Susu!

805
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,030
Susu!

806
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,840
Susu!

807
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,370
I'll take you home.

808
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,050
Susu...

809
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,390
I'll take you home.

810
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,730
I'll take you home!

811
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:55,960
Susu...

812
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,070
Help!

813
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,400
Help! I need help!

814
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,830
Help!

815
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,360
Somebody help me!

816
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,330
Help! Please!

817
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,620
[In loving memory of
my husband Fei Wendian]

818
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,030
The millet congee just cooled down.

819
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,110
Have some.

820
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Eat it, good girl.

821
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,970
She's too young

822
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,880
to know how to eat congee. See?

823
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,230
Why not

824
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,380
let me hold her?

825
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,550
I'll take her out.

826
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,400
Perhaps I can find a lactating woman

827
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,480
to feed her.

828
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,960
You stay. I'll do it.

829
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,580
This is a life.

830
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,030
We must fend for her.

831
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,920
Give her to me.

832
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,550
Let go, Xiu.

833
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,960
She has to be fed.

834
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,760
Come on.

835
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,630
Give her to me.

836
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,920
I'll find milk for her.

837
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,540
We'll be right back.

838
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,530
Come on.

839
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,070
Xiu,

840
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,190
your sister is gone.

841
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,970
No matter how many tears you shed,

842
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,600
Susu won't come back to life.

843
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,110
She already passed away.

844
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,550
We should take care of those

845
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,880
who are still around us.

846
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,060
I've told those who buried the bodies

847
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,730
not to disclose any information.

848
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,600
I briefed Yinzi about it too.

849
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,470
Let's keep

850
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,960
this matter secret from Father

851
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,330
for as long as possible.

852
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,550
Xiu,

853
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,430
you haven't said a word
after the incident.

854
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,920
Please say something.

855
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,980
Don't keep your emotions bottled up.

856
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,070
If you want to cry, let it out.

857
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,960
Hit me

858
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,000
if you're mad.

859
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,710
Okay?

860
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,310
Is it lactating?

861
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,040
Give it a squeeze.

862
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,800
How much is it?

863
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,110
Two silver dollars.

864
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,920
Two?

865
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,440
Why not just go rob?

866
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,050
With two more, I can get an ox.

867
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,110
Take it or leave it.

868
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,760
You're lucky to have met me,

869
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,460
with the whole place
under the Japanese' watch.

870
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,840
I'll take it.

871
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,590
Xiu!

872
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,720
Look.

873
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,740
I brought something back.

874
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,050
You got a sheep?

875
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,960
That's great.

876
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,920
Look,

877
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,670
there's food for the baby now.

878
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,190
Mother,

879
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,520
your idea was brilliant.

880
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,600
Let's get some milk

881
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,150
for the baby.

882
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,710
Come here.

883
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,760
Time to get milk for the baby.
