[This Thriving Land]

2
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,640
Unbelievable.

4
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,039
You two are finally back.

5
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,000
We're not some unsociable family.

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,580
Xiuxiu.

7
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,350
Dajiao.

8
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,560
My brother-in-law got such a fun sister.

9
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,150
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

10
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,509
Look,

11
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,000
Lulu gave me this thread flower.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,860
Pretty, right?

13
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,680
She said this craft

14
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,610
used to be found only in the palace.

15
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll go cook now.

16
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,550
Xiuxiu, I should head back too.

17
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,310
I came to get the newspaper for my sister-in-law

18
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,150
and drop by to see you.

19
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,360
Just happened to run into you.

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,690
Well,

21
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,360
let's talk another day, alright?

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,120
We'll talk later.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,910
I'll talk to you next time we meet.

24
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,960
Dajiao is tired.

25
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,650
Here, take some.

26
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,870
Come visit often.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
What's going on here?

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,960
Er.

29
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,579
We were just chatting with

30
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,040
that pretty girl in your yard. It's settled.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,400
Lulu, Lulu.

32
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,810
Godfather.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,630
All set.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,130
I've taken care of everything.

35
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,370
What's been taken care of?

36
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,070
All of it.

37
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,940
Let's talk about the house first.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,670
Don't bother

39
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,880
building one.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
I've found you a great spot.

41
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,190
It's Zhao's place,

42
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,470
Humpback Guo's neighbor

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,860
in our village.

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,430
That house has been empty for ages.

45
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,360
I checked it out.

46
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,430
Nice and square,

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,450
neat and proper.

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,750
It's just that no one's lived there in a while.

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,910
And there's even a backyard.

50
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,310
He said if you put down a big enough deposit,

51
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,060
you can use the backyard too.

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,870
That's wonderful!

53
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,630
I've done some calculations for you.

54
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,360
Look.

55
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,630
These days,

56
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,280
buying a house

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,410
is more worth it than building one.

58
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,120
Yes.

59
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,590
Yes.

60
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,079
Of course,

61
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm not trying to rush you out.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,700
I understand.

63
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,990
This is your home.

64
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,590
Live here

65
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,810
as long as you want.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,520
Don't count me in.

67
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,829
Well, I must thank you first, Godfather.

68
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,150
Why thank me?

69
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,300
You should thank Xiuxiu.

70
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,079
It was Xiuxiu

71
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,560
who found it for you.

72
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,960
So you said everything's been taken care of?

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,150
What else?

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,079
Could it be

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,290
the land has been arranged too?

76
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,840
That's the most important part.

77
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,230
There's a land agent in our village.

78
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,800
He knows which family

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
has what land

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,130
and what's for sale.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
There's a Zhang in the next village.

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
He has six mu

83
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,360
for sale.

84
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,800
The land's good.

85
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Great land.

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,800
It's just a bit far from here.

87
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,530
But as long as

88
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,840
the land's good,

89
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,240
distance doesn't matter.

90
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,680
Yes, it's not a problem.

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
As long as you like it,

92
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,510
I'll get this land agent

93
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,329
to bring the land deed.

94
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,920
Then we'll go to the office to exchange it for a red deed.

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,870
We need to turn this land deed

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,360
into a legal certificate, right?

97
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,430
Perfect.

98
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,830
Is it really 6 mu of land?

99
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,159
Don't forget,

100
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,360
there are 2 mu for you as well.

101
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,960
How could I forget?

102
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,550
Father,

103
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,350
why do you want everyone's land?

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,630
It's someone else's land.

105
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,950
What right do you have to take it?

106
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,280
Wait.

107
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,960
How am I "someone else?"

108
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm the goddaughter of your parents.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
I said no means no.

110
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,390
Do you know why Dajiao doesn't want Father to take the land?

111
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,450
He's being polite.

112
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,210
No reward for no merit.

113
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,280
You've done so much.

114
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,300
You must want something in return.

115
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,850
I don't want anything.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,860
I want nothing.

117
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,430
I'll just keep giving her the cold shoulder every day.

118
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,690
You should do the same.

119
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,670
If we keep this up, she'll leave.

120
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,070
I understand what you're thinking.

121
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,950
I also know

122
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,570
you can't hold anyone else in your heart.

123
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,670
Honestly, when she first came,

124
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,130
I didn't take it to heart.

125
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,680
Since our hearts are together,

126
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,159
I didn't want to get involved in her business.

127
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,490
But now it's different.

128
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,330
She's after Father and Mother's hearts.

129
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,159
If things really fall apart later,

130
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,890
Father and Mother will suffer.

131
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
So what do we do?

132
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm out of ideas.

133
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,560
Will she leave on her own?

134
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,950
What?

135
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,310
Lulu came here because she likes Dajiao?

136
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,530
I was just wondering

137
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,310
why this girl

138
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,160
is so strange.

139
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,360
I told you,

140
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,750
nothing in life just falls into your lap.

141
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,190
My boy

142
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,890
has attracted some romantic attention.

143
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,380
Mother,

144
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,280
what are you talking about?

145
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,160
Xiuxiu, I didn't mean anything by it.

146
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,440
I will never let Dajiao take a concubine.

147
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,600
I'll go tell your father right now.

148
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,830
If Lulu keeps going after Dajiao,

149
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,450
we can't keep her; we'll have to make her leave.

150
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,450
I'm going to find your father.

151
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,880
Be careful, Mother.

152
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,830
You're just blabbering

153
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,430
on and on.

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,260
Xiuxiu said that, didn't she?

155
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,710
She's afraid Dajiao will fall for that girl.

156
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,970
Can you really believe that?

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,560
I know what our son is like.

158
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,870
And I know what our daughter-in-law is like.

159
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,159
Should I believe Dajiao and my daughter-in-law

160
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,190
or that outsider girl?

161
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,660
Let's put aside who to believe for now.

162
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,850
The question is,

163
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,270
did Dajiao save

164
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,730
that girl and her brother?

165
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,120
That's true, isn't it?

166
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,620
That is indeed true.

167
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,550
Isn't that enough?

168
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,720
As long as that's true,

169
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,180
I'm definitely taking

170
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,310
that land.

171
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,430
Stop nagging.

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Father.

173
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,330
While Lulu isn't here,

174
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,720
I have to tell you,

175
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,910
you can't take the land

176
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,910
Lulu offered you.

177
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,360
Ridiculous.

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,880
Why can't I take the land

179
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,440
my goddaughter gave me?

180
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,270
I told your father

181
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,430
about Lulu liking Dajiao.

182
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,240
Talk to them yourself.

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,270
Lulu has feelings for you?

184
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,280
That's great! It shows my son is good.

185
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,840
It shows my son is likable.

186
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,960
Besides,

187
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,040
her liking you

188
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,240
doesn't cost you anything, right?

189
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,720
Father,

190
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,560
how can you say that?

191
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,680
Have you thought about

192
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,000
how hurt Xiu must feel?

193
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,870
No need to feel bad.

194
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,900
Lulu didn't steal Dajiao away.

195
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,960
Look at her now—

196
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,950
she's recognized me as her godfather.

197
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,160
She's close to us.

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,310
Over time,

199
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,650
she'll lose interest in you.

200
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,120
That's not the same thing.

201
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,560
How isn't it?

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,260
Let's put other things aside.

203
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,750
Let's just talk about Lulu.

204
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,480
Did she buy us

205
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,520
millet,

206
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,160
grain,

207
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,160
and...

208
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,630
wheat flour?

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,200
Right?

210
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,669
We can't eat, drink, and use her things

211
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,789
and then kick her out, can we?

212
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,500
You...

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,460
Father,

214
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm not actually upset.

215
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,980
Dajiao's heart is in the right place.

216
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,310
He wouldn't really be stolen away by Lulu.

217
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,960
I just feel

218
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,710
we can't pretend not to notice

219
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,350
that Lulu likes Dajiao

220
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,750
while taking advantage

221
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
of her

222
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,350
and wanting her land.

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,060
Then how is your son

224
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,410
any different from

225
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,030
a piece of pork with a price tag

226
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,030
in a butcher shop?

227
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,240
But my son isn't pork.

228
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,250
Father,

229
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,030
I promise you

230
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,270
that once the Turtle Hill grows medicinal herbs,

231
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,870
all the money from selling them will go to buy the land for you.

232
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,550
Isn't it more reassuring if we buy the land ourselves?

233
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,350
What the hell?

234
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
What are you growing on the Turtle Hill?

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,510
Medicinal herbs?

236
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,200
Perfectly good land and you're not growing grain

237
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,120
but herbs instead?

238
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Who said that?

239
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,630
Who approved this?

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,910
As long as I'm still alive,

241
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,030
we won't grow any of that nonsense!

242
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,270
Tomorrow,

243
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,440
I'll get sorghum seeds

244
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,120
and plant the whole Turtle Hill

245
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,240
with sorghum.

246
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,880
Are you done eating?

247
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,240
I can't eat anymore.

248
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,320
Father isn't really planting sorghum, is he?

249
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,030
Yesterday was the day

250
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,320
Chang Chun said he'd deliver the medicinal seedlings.

251
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,180
I really hope he brings them soon.

252
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,650
You just stay here,

253
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,780
digging wild vegetables and resting.

254
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,650
You'll see when the cart arrives.

255
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,510
If the seedlings really arrive,

256
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,190
go straight to the Turtle Hill.

257
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,820
I'll go back and keep an eye on Father.

258
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,080
If Father really insists on planting sorghum,

259
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,510
don't argue with him.

260
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,080
I know.

261
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,030
Be careful.

262
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,690
Lulu!

263
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,030
Lulu!

264
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,360
Didn't she go with you to look at the house?

265
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,240
Don't even mention it.

266
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,440
Didn't Lulu take me

267
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,620
and Humpback Guo

268
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,110
to see that house?

269
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,550
She looked around for a long time

270
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,360
but couldn't make up her mind.

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
By noon,

272
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,320
the land agent arrived

273
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,910
and said the seller wouldn't sell the land because he couldn't

274
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,330
see the rest of the money.

275
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,870
When Lulu heard that,

276
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,000
she said she'd come back

277
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,240
to get the money quickly

278
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,870
and told me to wait there.

279
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,710
But she hasn't shown up yet.

280
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,800
I've checked.

281
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,960
Nothing's missing from the house.

282
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,790
It's so late at night.

283
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,070
A young girl all alone,

284
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,380
where could she have gone?

285
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,390
Let's have Dajiao look for her later.

286
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,240
No need.

287
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,510
Why?

288
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,530
I just ran into Humpback Guo.

289
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,800
He said Lulu borrowed his donkey cart to go to the county.

290
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
She went to the county alone?

291
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,630
This Humpback Guo.

292
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,140
He should've told me earlier.

293
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,320
Xiuxiu.

294
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,670
How did you find me here?

295
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,810
I came to your house to find you but you weren't there.

296
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,310
Auntie Feng said you were digging wild vegetables on the back hill.

297
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,580
Are you okay with that body of yours?

298
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,220
Of course.

299
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,000
Look how much I've gathered.

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,260
Mother taught me before. Let me help you.

301
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,030
Here.

302
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,750
Here they are.

303
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,360
Didn't Mrs. Fei say

304
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,980
she'd teach you to manage the accounts?

305
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,580
How did you manage to get out?

306
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,910
When bandits surrounded the village,

307
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,150
I took care of her.

308
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,450
Since then, she's been really good to me

309
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,970
and doesn't force me to do anything.

310
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,380
I got tired of looking at the account books,

311
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,710
so I said I wanted to find you, and here I am.

312
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,960
Why are you grinning?

313
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
I just think Lulu

314
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,120
is really fun.

315
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,860
I love hearing her talk about the outside world.

316
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,080
When I told my sister-in-law about those stories,

317
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,210
she laughed so much.

318
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,380
You really like this Lulu, huh?

319
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,900
She's really nice.

320
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,330
What if you had to choose between her and your sister?

321
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,730
I would never choose her.

322
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,960
What do you mean?

323
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,270
What do you mean, Xiuxiu?

324
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,200
No matter how good she is at telling jokes,

325
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
she's still an outsider.

326
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,700
Xiuxiu,

327
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
what do you mean?

328
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm just joking with you.

329
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,510
No,

330
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
you don't sound like you're joking.

331
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,840
What's wrong? What do you mean?

332
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,240
It looks like Chang Chuan

333
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,610
is not coming.

334
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,890
Let's go. We won't wait anymore.

335
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,490
I'll tell you on our way back.

336
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Here, let me take it.

337
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,870
Be careful.

338
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,630
Take it easy.

339
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,810
You go first.

340
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,480
Watch your step.

341
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,840
Giddyup!

342
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,970
These are salvia miltiorrhiza seedlings? So many?

343
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,550
I didn't expect

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
that Lulu actually bought them.

345
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,030
She even fell on the way

346
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
and hurt her head.

347
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,390
Are you alright, girl?

348
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,390
I'm fine.

349
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,720
Let's plant them quickly.

350
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,080
Yes, let's do it.

351
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,360
Yes.

352
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,320
Tietou, you've got a heavy task today.

353
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,800
The new seedlings need water.

354
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,280
Okay,

355
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,630
I'll fetch the water.

356
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,080
Lulu.

357
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,240
Where did you

358
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,910
get these seedlings from?

359
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,910
I have my ways.

360
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,170
When I got to the county,

361
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,280
I went straight to the ghost market.

362
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,790
They sell

363
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,320
all kinds of rare stuff there.

364
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
I asked around and actually got real info.

365
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,180
I followed the person selling the medicinal seedlings

366
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,910
and traveled a long way by cart.

367
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,030
He had people dig them right in the field

368
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,040
right in front of me.

369
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,840
I've checked—

370
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,590
these are

371
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,320
red-rooted ones.

372
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,920
These are the salvia miltiorrhiza you wanted.

373
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,720
Look at these leaves. They look right.

374
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,000
They can't be wrong.

375
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,550
I paid a good price for them.

376
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,440
Let's plant them quickly.

377
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,670
Don't let the seedlings I worked so hard to buy back

378
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,390
die from drought.

379
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,080
Let's plant them. Come on.

380
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,610
Hurry up.

381
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,760
Take some seedlings

382
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,380
and plant them in the land you prepared.

383
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,030
I'm not in a hurry. Let's plant them all first.

384
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,360
I can transplant them later.

385
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,550
Don't worry.

386
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,530
I've found some people to help. They'll be here soon.

387
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,530
I'm here first.

388
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,630
Father.

389
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,360
What's going on with you, girl?

390
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,240
You said you'd help me,

391
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,750
so why did you start planting these medicinal seedlings?

392
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,030
You've got some nerve.

393
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,590
You're not my goddaughter anymore.

394
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,590
That won't do.

395
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,030
Godfather,

396
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,920
didn't I give you two mu of land?

397
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,000
You can plant sorghum

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,800
on those two mu of land, alright?

399
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,240
Don't be angry with me.

400
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,550
Calm down.

401
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,120
You...

402
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,510
Patting me won't help.

403
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,770
Just get those two mu of land first.

404
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,830
Godfather...

405
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,510
Xiuxiu, Xiuxiu.

406
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,500
You shouldn't do it.

407
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,200
How about this?

408
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,240
You divide the seedlings,

409
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
and we'll plant them.

410
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,150
You don't know how to plant anyway,

411
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,410
so don't get in the way.

412
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,000
I can learn.

413
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,240
I'll ask my godmother to teach me.

414
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,970
Take it easy.

415
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,210
Godmother.

416
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:19,720
Here.

417
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,910
She really helped a lot.

418
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,350
I'm worried though—

419
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,510
how can we ever

420
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,950
repay this kindness?

421
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,630
With you?

422
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,960
Don't talk nonsense.

423
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
Take it easy.

424
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
Careful.

425
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,800
It's fine.

426
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,630
Take one basket at a time.

427
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay.

428
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,210
Have a rest. Don't do anything.

429
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Thanks to all the villagers helping out.

430
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,740
Otherwise,

431
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,450
we wouldn't have finished planting today.

432
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,450
That's right.

433
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,840
Lulu!

434
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,040
Susu? You came to hang out with me?

435
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,760
You're finally back.

436
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,580
Here's your stupid thing.

437
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,110
I was wondering why you wouldn't leave.

438
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,850
So you've taken a liking to my brother-in-law.

439
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,450
You're quite something.

440
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,720
Let me tell you,

441
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,700
my sister might be easy to push around,

442
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,850
but I'm not.

443
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,880
Why are you saying this?

444
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,910
Come on, sit down and let's talk.

445
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,360
Hurry up and leave!

446
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,640
Go!

447
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,270
Dajiao! Dajiao!

448
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,220
Susu!

449
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,580
Don't make trouble here.

450
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,340
Go home now.

451
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,300
Feng Dajiao,

452
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,470
you're the last person who should be talking here.

453
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,340
What do you mean?

454
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,540
You're protecting her?

455
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,200
Are you planning to cheat on my sister?

456
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Don't… don't talk nonsense.

457
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,180
How could I cheat on her?

458
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,910
Susu,

459
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,960
give Lulu a break.

460
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,280
She's tired from working all day.

461
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,920
Tired?

462
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,350
That's just an excuse.

463
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,350
I must see her leave today.

464
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,720
I can't let her

465
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,130
come between you and your husband.

466
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,150
Anyone trying to cause trouble

467
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,480
has to get past me first.

468
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,250
Godmother.

469
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,960
Old Man.

470
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,760
Time to eat.

471
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,550
Old Man.

472
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,570
Dujiao. Eat more, Dujiao.

473
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
Is this Feng Dajiao's house?

474
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,600
Yes.

475
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,490
And you are?

476
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,859
My name's Zhao Changming.

477
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,859
Shopkeeper Chang Chun sent me here.

478
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,730
Shopkeeper Chang Chun?

479
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,930
Come on in, hurry up.

480
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,190
Come in and have a seat.

481
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,510
Susu, be good and go home now.

482
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,240
Come, sit down.

483
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,290
Be good and go home, okay?

484
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,750
If you need anything, come to me, Xiuxiu.

485
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,849
Did I keep you from eating?

486
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,690
Not at all.

487
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,839
Shopkeeper Chang Chun sent me here

488
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
to apologize to you.

489
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,310
Our old shopkeeper has promised

490
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,450
his daughter to Shopkeeper Chang Chun.

491
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,319
Shopkeeper Chang Chun

492
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,099
opened a new store in the county.

493
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,350
Our shopkeeper said he couldn't

494
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,940
come in person to deliver the seedlings this time

495
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,400
and asked for your understanding.

496
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
He had me bring you

497
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,670
the salvia miltiorrhiza seeds

498
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,030
and show you how to plant them.

499
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,400
We should thank him

500
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
for thinking of us.

501
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
That's very kind.

502
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're late.

503
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,960
We've already bought the seedlings and planted them.

504
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,770
Just finished.

505
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,730
Dajiao, Xiuxiu,

506
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,440
go to the Turtle Hill to take a look.

507
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,860
Something doesn't seem right.

508
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,950
I've already watered them,

509
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,170
but the seedlings haven't recovered.

510
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,630
They've all turned black.

511
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,220
Come. Get over here.

512
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,630
What?

513
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,510
I'm asking you,

514
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,320
was Lulu

515
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,470
brought here by you?

516
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,540
Hurry up and find a way to get her gone.

517
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,620
What can I do?

518
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,470
She's here for...

519
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,770
She's here for my brother-in-law, right?

520
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,300
Then we must make her leave.

521
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,800
How am I supposed to bring this up?

522
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,590
I don't care. You knew her first.

523
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,650
So you need to handle this.

524
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,930
No matter what you do,

525
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,130
she can't get in the middle

526
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,990
of my sister and brother-in-law.

527
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,430
Hurry up.

528
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,720
Hurry up and solve this problem.

529
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,250
Go find that Lulu right now.

530
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
You're not going?

531
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
If you don't go,

532
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,120
I won't buy things from your shop anymore.

533
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,380
You won't get my money.

534
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,510
I'll go.

535
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,760
I'll go now.

536
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,640
This woman really can't be messed with.

537
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,240
Close the door for me.

538
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,590
Look, they've all turned black and wilted.

539
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,590
What are these?

540
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,280
Dajiao,

541
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,680
Xiuxiu,

542
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,550
these aren't salvia miltiorrhiza seedlings at all.

543
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,680
That's impossible.

544
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,000
The guy who sold them to me is an herb seller.

545
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
How could he be wrong?

546
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
I think he didn't make a mistake.

547
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,050
He just tricked you.

548
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,680
These are three-flowered Schnabelia.

549
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,220
The leaves look similar to salvia miltiorrhiza,

550
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,950
but the plants are newly grown,

551
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,690
so it's hard to tell the difference.

552
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,280
He saw you were inexperienced,

553
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,330
so he lied to you.

554
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,710
That can't be right.

555
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,240
I saw him get people to dig them.

556
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,640
They dug for four hours.

557
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,560
That doesn't prove he dug up salvia miltiorrhiza.

558
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,710
And as far as I know,

559
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,010
there's no one around here

560
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,190
selling transplanted salvia miltiorrhiza seedlings,

561
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,320
except the ones our shopkeeper knows.

562
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,760
But this time, they are all busy with family matters,

563
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,270
so there was no way they could make it.

564
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,880
Well...

565
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,850
What use is this grass?

566
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,710
I...

567
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,960
I only know that when it grows,

568
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,190
the root and bark can be used as medicine.

569
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,050
But I've never heard of anyone planting it,

570
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,110
let alone transplanting seedlings.

571
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,630
Look, after all this,

572
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,680
these plants

573
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,920
are all withered, black, and rotten.

574
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,890
This thing can't survive once it's removed from soil.

575
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,620
He heard I needed them urgently,

576
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,620
so he asked me for 12 silver dollars.

577
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,850
Twelve?

578
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,840
That price alone proves he lied to you.

579
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,920
Even our seedlings

580
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,740
wouldn't cost nearly that much.

581
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,610
No.

582
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,240
I have to settle accounts with that swindler.

583
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,070
I remember his herbal stall.

584
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm going to find him right now.

585
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,750
Don't stop me.

586
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,850
I need to get my money back.

587
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,170
Let Dajiao go with you.

588
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,590
Dajiao,

589
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,080
you can't let her take this risk alone again.

590
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,320
Go borrow a cart

591
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,340
from Guo

592
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,010
and go with her to find that seller.

593
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,860
See if you can get the loss back.

594
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,870
Here. This is the evidence.

595
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,070
Take it.

596
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,160
You folks are really hard to find.

597
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
I was looking for you.

598
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,400
There's an urgent matter. I need to borrow your cart.

599
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,700
You're coming with me too. Come on, let's go.

600
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,110
Wait. I need to find Lulu for something.

601
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,510
Lulu's coming with us.

602
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:46,900
Hurry up.

603
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,110
You can talk on the way. Hurry.

604
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,980
Let's go!

605
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,690
Hurry!

606
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,380
Let's go.

607
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,530
Oh right, Xiuxiu.

608
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,460
Shopkeeper Chang Chun asked me

609
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,220
to bring you two books.

610
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,710
He said this book

611
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,720
covers everything

612
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,680
about salvia miltiorrhiza—

613
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,220
its uses, medicinal properties,

614
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:04,970
[Certificate Herbs]

615
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,290
and the soil it grows best in.

616
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,740
He said it'll definitely come in handy

617
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,140
when you plant the herbs.

618
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,120
Shopkeeper Chang Chun also said

619
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,790
you can read.

620
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,070
All the common herbs

621
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,270
around here

622
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,450
are in this book.

623
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,180
Thank you.

624
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,270
You're welcome.

625
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,110
Xiuxiu,

626
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,720
it's great that you can read.

627
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,070
Nothing can stump you.

628
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,030
But now I really don't know what to do.

629
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,570
Changming.

630
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
I truly don't know

631
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,160
what we should do about this.

632
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,120
You should start by digging up the seedlings

633
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,090
and plowing the field.

634
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,090
After that,

635
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,110
scatter the seeds I brought.

636
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,010
We'll follow your lead.

637
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,110
Tietou,

638
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,570
help Xiuxiu get started.

639
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,290
I'll go find some help.

640
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,400
Zhuzi, Sister-in-law, and others want to plant them too.

641
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,000
This time, let's start by learning how to plant.

642
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,240
Okay.

643
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,830
The more people, the better.

644
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,830
This is simple. Anyone can learn it.

645
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:55,850
Xiuxiu.

646
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,240
I'll do it.

647
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,360
You take a rest.

648
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,550
Can I let her come between

649
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,980
my sister and brother-in-law?

650
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,270
I have to chase her away.

651
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,990
You did?

652
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,830
I did.

653
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,420
In front of my sister and her whole family,

654
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,570
I threw that thread flower she gave me

655
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,500
onto the ground.

656
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,110
What did she say? Did she leave?

657
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,790
Not yet.

658
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,690
But she'll definitely leave.

659
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,610
After I tried to chase her away,

660
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,010
I had Humpback Guo do it too.

661
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,860
He knew her first,

662
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,950
so he had to help us.

663
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,600
You

664
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,700
don't need to get so worked up.

665
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,160
Your sister will figure it out herself.

666
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,790
You don't need to meddle.

667
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,960
In the future, you should stay out of

668
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,420
other people's business.

669
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,080
How can this be other people's business?

670
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,750
This is our own family's business.

671
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,470
I've always been worried about my sister.

672
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,400
She said she and my brother-in-law

673
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,370
are planning to grow medicinal herbs.

674
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,470
Once they're grown,

675
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,590
the Feng family's 20 mu of land will all be planted with medicinal herbs.

676
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,390
What was that herb called again?

677
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,950
Salvia miltiorrhiza.

678
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,400
Right, salvia miltiorrhiza.

679
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,840
After selling them,

680
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,130
my sister's family will be better off.

681
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,750
They'll be able to buy grain, and anything they want.

682
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,200
Then I won't have to worry about her.

683
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,550
Twenty mu of land all for herbs?

684
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,890
They won't grow grain?

685
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,690
That's right.

686
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,890
Herbs are worth much more than grain.

687
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,780
Now you're bragging on your sister's behalf.

688
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,260
I'm not bragging, Sister-in-law.

689
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,220
A friend of Dajiao even said

690
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,350
he'll give them the seedlings and seeds for free

691
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,540
and buy the harvest in autumn.

692
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,910
Sister-in-law, don't you think

693
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,910
my sister's family hit the jackpot?

694
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,740
Remember,

695
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,320
before sowing,

696
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,300
water the soil thoroughly.

697
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,670
In half a month,

698
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,430
all the seedlings will come up.

699
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,390
When the seedlings

700
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,300
are thumb-high,

701
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,260
remove the extras

702
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,950
and keep the good ones.

703
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,740
Got it?

704
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,260
Got it.

705
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,830
This time,

706
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,870
thank you all for your help.

707
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,800
We were planning to distribute the seeds to you,

708
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,950
but considering how valuable everyone's land is,

709
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,110
if something goes wrong,

710
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,020
it might delay your grain planting.

711
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,830
So this time,

712
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,300
I'll plant them first,

713
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,190
and when the seedlings grow,

714
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,350
we'll divide and transplant them to you.

715
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,210
Does that work?

716
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,150
Yes!

717
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,350
Good.

718
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,190
Changming,

719
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
these will survive once planted, right?

720
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,930
They'll grow easily once planted.

721
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,830
That's great.

722
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,740
Well…

723
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,630
you really won't charge us for the seedlings?

724
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,890
We already made a deal.

725
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
After they're harvested and dried,

726
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,980
when they come to collect the herbs,

727
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,380
they'll actually pay us.

728
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
You have no idea.

729
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,950
The little grain we harvest each year

730
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,670
can't be wasted.

731
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,700
After paying rent,

732
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,540
we just hope to sell the rest at a good price

733
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,270
to buy things like oil and salt.

734
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,780
Carrying this little rice around,

735
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,350
going from house to house,

736
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,780
won't get a good price.

737
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,750
Growing medicinal herbs is so much better.

738
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,870
Easier, right?

739
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,030
That's exactly how it works for us.

740
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,490
We provide good seedlings

741
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,460
and seeds,

742
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,870
distribute them on suitable plots of land,

743
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,270
and settle accounts after autumn harvest.

744
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,030
After deducting the cost of seedlings and seeds,

745
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,950
the rest is paid by weight

746
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,210
according to quality.

747
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,740
This place is actually

748
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,150
the furthest herb-growing land

749
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,870
for our boss, Chang Chun.

750
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,740
It's because Xiuxiu and Dajiao are good people

751
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
that our boss trusts you.

752
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,780
But people have grown

753
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,830
medicinal herbs on this land before.

754
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,390
The soil is especially suitable.

755
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,870
Anyway, we're benefiting from Xiuxiu

756
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,060
and Dajiao.

757
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,870
That's right.

758
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,560
Tell your boss not to worry.

759
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,880
We're good farmers.

760
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,110
We'll definitely grow them well

761
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,150
and get you the best-quality herbs.

762
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,950
Who's foolish enough not to?

763
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,190
That would just be throwing away our own money.

764
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,700
Throwing our own money.

765
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,780
Let's get started then.

766
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,190
Alright. Take your seeds.

767
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,950
Come on, let's start planting.

768
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,590
Come on.

769
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,870
Lulu!

770
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,590
Lulu!

771
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,780
Lulu!

772
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,460
Lulu and Dajiao...

773
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,560
Old Man, you have no idea.

774
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,980
The seeds Lulu bought were fake.

775
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,910
She was scammed,

776
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,160
The two of them went to find the seller.

777
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,360
Who knows if they'll even find the swindler.

778
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,730
Find the swindler?

779
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,880
How can they find the swindler?

780
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,150
He must have run off long ago.

781
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,990
I'm eager to find Lulu too.

782
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,140
Why are you so eager?

783
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,020
Don't even mention it.

784
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,500
Didn't Lulu promise

785
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
to buy those two mu of land for me?

786
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,140
I went there with the sorghum seedlings,

787
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,080
but they wouldn't let me plant.

788
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,870
When I asked around, I found out

789
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,910
Lulu only

790
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,310
paid half of the money

791
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,700
and didn't give the rest.

792
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,910
They kicked me out on the spot.

793
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,260
I'm looking for her now

794
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,660
to make her pay the remaining half quickly.

795
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,980
Father, Lulu probably

796
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,590
took the money for the land

797
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,040
to buy the seedlings.

798
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,890
If you're really in a hurry for that land,

799
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,830
why not use your own money

800
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,090
to buy it first?

801
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,420
Use my own money to buy that land?

802
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,060
Do you think

803
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,740
I've lost my mind?

804
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,260
Is that land even worth it?

805
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,590
No way.

806
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,130
If it's given for free, I'll take it.

807
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,770
Want me to pay for it?

808
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,240
No.

809
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,520
What do you mean by that?

810
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,590
So you're saying Lulu can't possibly

811
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,400
pay him the other half?

812
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
I'm not sure, Father.

813
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,170
But Lulu bought the medicinal seedlings

814
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,440
and got scammed just to help Dajiao.

815
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,950
Forcing her

816
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,300
to pay now

817
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,950
doesn't seem right, does it?

818
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,630
Doesn't seem right?

819
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,950
She offered to buy it for me.

820
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,390
I didn't force her.

821
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,370
You've always had her

822
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,040
call you godfather—

823
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,780
is that just for the land?

824
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
What else could it be for? Her?

825
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,760
I've been trying not to think that way.

826
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Seriously, I'm telling you,

827
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,260
when Lulu comes back,

828
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,190
don't even mention the land again.

829
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,060
What are you all doing?

830
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,590
Didn't we dig up the fake seedlings?

831
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,540
Dajiao had someone bring the salvia miltiorrhiza seeds.

832
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,200
We have to plant them quickly.

833
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,440
We can't plant herbs!

834
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,320
We're planting sorghum!

835
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,430
Second Uncle, why won't you

836
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,390
let us plant herbs?

837
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,500
Whose land is this?

838
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,910
Who gets to decide?

839
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,220
Sorghum is food.

840
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,650
You can eat it.

841
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,370
Can you eat herbs?

842
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,150
Fine, fine.

843
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,590
You can have half of the land.

844
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,590
You can plant sorghum on your half.

845
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,670
Get!

846
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,700
Father!

847
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,160
We can only plant sorghum!

848
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,910
Father!

849
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,740
Stop planting! Stop!

850
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,690
Let's all go home! It's time to cook!

851
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,750
No one is planting!

852
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,670
Let's go!

853
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,300
Leave! All of you!

854
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,010
Why is he acting like this?

855
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,060
Xiuxiu.

856
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,300
Xiuxiu,

857
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,870
I have to set off before dark.

858
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,430
I'll see you off.

859
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,980
Don't.

860
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
Tietou, you go.

861
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,590
Xiuxiu, just rest.

862
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,940
I'll see Changming off.

863
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,020
Let's go.

864
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,950
What do we do now?

865
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,000
So what's the plan now?

866
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,050
Let's call it off today. We won't plant them.

867
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,150
Let's go.

868
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,980
Come on.

869
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,700
Greetings, Mr. Ning.

870
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,500
Mrs. Fei.

871
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,350
Come in.

872
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,060
Sit here. Have a seat.

873
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,330
Have a seat.

874
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,190
Father,

875
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,190
this is the tobacco Mrs. Fei specially

876
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,870
had Xiao Qing buy for you.

877
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,090
Take a look. How is it?

878
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,110
Look at this!

879
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,060
You shouldn't have spent money on this, Mrs. Fei.

880
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,460
It's the least I could do.

881
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,870
Susu has been thinking of you

882
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,060
and wanted to come back to see you.

883
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
I thought,

884
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,700
since I'm also a junior,

885
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,260
I should come and apologize.

886
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,210
About Susu's pregnancy...

887
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,200
I was just upset at the time.

888
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,950
Please don't take it to heart.

889
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,390
Young couples quarrel all the time.

890
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
I was at fault too.

891
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,920
I shouldn't have meddled in the young couple's matters.

892
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,520
I should apologize too.

893
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,910
As a father, you love your daughter. I understand.

894
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,370
Father,

895
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,600
how's the tobacco?

896
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,670
Look,

897
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,040
it's golden brown.

898
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,150
Nice and clean.

899
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,280
That's pretty good.

900
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,350
Mr. Ning,

901
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,190
I heard that Xiuxiu—

902
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,520
oh, the Feng family,

903
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,200
is planning to plant medicinal herbs on all 20 mu of their land.

904
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,980
They said they were going to plant salvia miltiorrhiza.

905
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,630
What?

906
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,630
You're saying Xiuxiu wants to plant salvia miltiorrhiza on the Feng family's land?

907
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,300
Yes.

908
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,500
And the two mu of newly cleared

909
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,390
Turtle Hill too?

910
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,630
You knew that?

911
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,310
Don't talk nonsense.

912
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,590
That's impossible.

913
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,910
If they don't grow grain, what will they eat?

914
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,390
Selling herbs will bring money,

915
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,560
then they can buy grain.

916
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,470
My sister said

917
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,390
selling herbs

918
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,060
is much more profitable than selling grain.

919
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,780
I even want my sister-in-law to plant some too.

920
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,870
Yes, you probably know

921
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,260
that I invested in

922
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,150
an herbal shop in town.

923
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,520
But I don't know anything

924
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,130
about planting herbs.

925
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,150
I just vaguely remember

926
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,350
the shop owner saying that

927
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,870
several generations of the Ning family

928
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,630
used to grow salvia miltiorrhiza.

929
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,630
I thought

930
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,070
it was your idea for Xiuxiu

931
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,590
and maybe you had some special method.

932
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,060
I figured

933
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,750
we could plant it together.

934
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,620
After all, we're in-laws.

935
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,020
We should get rich together.

936
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,150
Get rich?

937
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,910
Since I was born,

938
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,890
I've never heard of anyone getting rich

939
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,420
from these crooked things.

940
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,710
This land is for growing grain.

941
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,320
Growing grain and harvesting grain—

942
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,540
that's the duty

943
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,590
of us farmers

944
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
who work the land.

945
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,670
Planting these crooked things

946
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,950
will bring heaven's punishment sooner or later.

947
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,500
So you're saying

948
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,460
the Ning family

949
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,410
never planted salvia miltiorrhiza?

950
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,630
Go back and tell your sister

951
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,280
to stop causing trouble.

952
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,350
She just married into

953
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,460
the Feng family.

954
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,560
Don't cause chaos.

955
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,060
If she keeps messing around,

956
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,670
heaven might punish her.

957
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,280
Tell her to settle down

958
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,800
and live a proper life.

959
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,510
What's wrong, Sister-in-law?

960
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,440
Are we still planting herbs or not?

961
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,150
Something feels off.

962
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,950
What is it, Sister-in-law?

963
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,190
Don't scare me.

964
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,770
What could possibly be wrong?

965
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,630
Father.

966
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,030
How did it go?

967
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,540
The people at the herb market said

968
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,470
that after the seller

969
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,070
sold fake seedlings to Lulu,

970
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,260
he abandoned his stall

971
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,790
and ran off that very night.

972
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,450
You didn't find the swindler?

973
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,460
So the money's gone with him?

974
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,260
Well, Daughter.

975
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,220
Take a deep breath

976
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,770
and stay calm.

977
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,880
Even if the sky falls, don't panic.

978
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,670
We can always earn money.

979
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,840
How about this?

980
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,640
Tomorrow,

981
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,740
pay the rest of the money

982
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,020
to them.

983
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,740
I went to the field today.

984
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,060
They said

985
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,870
they wouldn't let me plant

986
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,170
because the money wasn't fully paid.

987
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,700
I'll be honest with you.

988
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,670
I don't have much money.

989
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,100
But before...

990
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,190
I did have enough to buy those two mu of land for you.

991
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,460
Since Dajiao was in a hurry,

992
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,900
I used the remaining 12 silver dollars

993
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,980
to buy the herb seedlings.

994
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,040
Now

995
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,820
there's nothing left.

996
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,200
What?

997
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
What do you mean?

998
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,630
Are you saying

999
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,470
the money for the land

1000
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,500
is gone?

1001
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,700
Come on...

1002
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,260
Then we've been your godfather and godmother for nothing?

1003
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,280
So if I don't buy the land for you, you won't be my godparents?

1004
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,060
Girl,

1005
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,320
your godfather—

1006
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,390
your uncle didn't mean that.

1007
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,110
Fine.

1008
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,080
I'll leave then.

1009
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,830
Even heaven won't help me.

1010
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,150
I'll go pack my things now.

1011
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,870
Lulu.

1012
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,950
You've been busy all afternoon.

1013
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,950
Have some water.

1014
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,050
Let's keep things separate.

1015
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,570
You were scammed buying hurb seedlings for Dajiao.

1016
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,210
We have to take responsibility for that.

1017
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,100
Even if I have to borrow the money,

1018
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,909
I'll pay you back.

1019
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,980
What a disaster.

1020
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,540
This trouble came out of nowhere.

1021
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,540
Where are we supposed to borrow money from?

1022
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,719
I don't want your money.

1023
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,790
Buying the seedlings was my own choice.

1024
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,850
Getting scammed was just my bad luck.

1025
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,580
It has nothing to do with you.

1026
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,710
I earned that money and I can earn more.

1027
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,969
There's no reason to have you pay me back.

1028
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,870
Mother,

1029
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,270
it's time to cook.

1030
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,639
Seriously.

1031
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,640
I told you not to push yourself.

1032
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,770
You have no chance.

1033
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,080
Just take a good rest

1034
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,460
and think about when you want to leave.

1035
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
I'll send you off.

1036
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,900
Where are you sending me?

1037
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,370
How would I know where you'd go?

1038
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,140
I need to make money.

1039
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,350
All my money's been spent, scammed,

1040
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:22,980
and wasted.

1041
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,340
I have to earn it back.

1042
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,950
Make money?

1043
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,020
Here?

1044
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,790
What?

1045
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,870
How?

1046
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
I can spend it, so I can earn it.

1047
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,270
What can you do?

1048
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,430
Your skills won't work here.

1049
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,100
No one listens to your singing,

1050
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,430
and no one understands your pipa playing,

1051
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,950
except me.

1052
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,390
How I make money

1053
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,540
is none of your business.

1054
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Is it necessary?

1055
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,580
Getting up so early to plant?

1056
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,710
What do you think?

1057
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,880
We planted half of the seeds, but Father stopped us.

1058
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,680
If we don't keep planting, the rest won't be saved.

1059
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,620
But still, I think we shouldn't

1060
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,640
hide it from Father.

1061
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,910
We can discuss it with him.

1062
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,750
Discuss?

1063
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,300
You really think discussion will work?

1064
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,180
I just don't think we should

1065
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,710
act first and report later.

1066
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,110
Is Father wrong for planting sorghum?

1067
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,390
He's doing it for the family,

1068
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,750
to grow more grain,

1069
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,310
and for this child...

1070
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,180
Are you saying I'm wrong?

1071
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,640
Am I growing salvia miltiorrhiza for myself?

1072
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,280
No.

1073
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,540
Xiuxiu!

1074
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,390
Dajiao!

1075
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,020
Let me tell you,

1076
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,550
you met Shopkeeper Chang Chun with me.

1077
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,150
You also know about the salvia miltiorrhiza.

1078
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,710
He gave us seedlings and seeds for free,

1079
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,080
with payment due only at harvest time.

1080
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,980
You agreed to everything before.

1081
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,910
Why are you changing your mind now?

1082
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,660
I still think...

1083
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,710
Stop thinking.

1084
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,710
Think about it yourself.

1085
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,620
The helpers are all here now.

1086
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,500
Dajiao.

1087
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,390
Thank you all for your hard work.

1088
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,190
It's just a small job.

1089
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,650
We can finish before noon.

1090
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,350
Here, give it to me.

1091
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,680
I got up early, didn't I?

1092
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,230
Take it easy.

1093
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,390
Be careful.

1094
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,380
What are you doing? Sneaking around like a thief.

1095
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,980
Just let them plant. They've already done half.

1096
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,090
Just pretend Dajiao

1097
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,830
never cleared these two mu this year.

1098
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,790
Stop nagging.

1099
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,980
It's a good thing I didn't dig up what they planted.

1100
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,040
I'll plant sorghum

1101
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,590
on the remaining half.

1102
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,290
Everyone, take a break. Have some water.

1103
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,250
It's fine.

1104
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,830
When did you all get here?

1105
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,780
Second Uncle,

1106
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,620
we didn't go back last night.

1107
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,600
Don't talk nonsense.

1108
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,950
Father, we came early this morning.

1109
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,550
It's good to plant while the dew is still fresh.

1110
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,870
Plant?

1111
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,660
Plant what?

1112
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,500
Who told you to plant?

1113
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,460
Where's Dajiao?

1114
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,490
Is Dajiao here?

1115
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,550
Dajiao isn't here.

1116
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,150
I told them to plant.

1117
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,980
We're not planting them in anyone else's field.

1118
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,310
It's good that everyone came to help.

1119
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,620
Why don't you take a rest?

1120
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,870
You should rest.

1121
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,460
You look tired.

1122
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,100
Such good land should only be for sorghum.

1123
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,120
If you don't plant sorghum, what will you eat after the fall?

1124
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,520
You'll starve to death!

1125
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,270
Father,

1126
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,060
didn't we already plant sorghum in the main field?

1127
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Main field?

1128
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,750
Since when do you manage the main field?

1129
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,600
I'm not managing it.

1130
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,330
Father, sit.

1131
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,710
Let me go over the accounts for you.

1132
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,770
I'm not listening.

1133
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,670
Do it.

1134
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,830
All your calculations

1135
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,070
are complete

1136
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,270
nonsense.

1137
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,950
Father.

1138
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,710
Xiuxiu.

1139
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:42,970
Xiuxiu.

1140
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,500
Uncle Feng.

1141
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,730
Why are you here so early?

1142
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:47,830
I saw no one at your house,

1143
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,660
so I knew

1144
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,830
you must be here.

1145
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,460
Xiuxiu, I want to tell you

1146
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,270
don't plant these herbs

1147
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,180
for now.

1148
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,640
Why are you telling me this too?

1149
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,100
Last time you spoke so well about it,

1150
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,460
so I told my sister-in-law,

1151
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,140
hoping she could plant some too.

1152
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,460
She asked Father.

1153
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,950
He said these things really shouldn't be planted.

1154
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,750
Did your father really say that?

1155
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,910
Why can't they be planted?

1156
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,310
He didn't explain why.

1157
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,370
But my sister-in-law said

1158
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,710
there must be something wrong with it.

1159
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,350
Xiuxiu,

1160
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,740
Father also asked me to tell you that...

1161
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,660
What?

1162
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,570
I told you not to mess around

1163
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,620
and just live a good life in the Feng family.

1164
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,140
Listen!

1165
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:21,930
Listen!

1166
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,140
My in-law said the same.

1167
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,620
If you don't listen to your elders,

1168
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,480
you'll suffer the consequences.

1169
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,230
I know all the rules and experience

1170
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
of life.

1171
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,620
Where did you come from

1172
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,520
to interfere in my business?

1173
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,760
Where do you think I came from?

1174
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,350
I came up because of your plan to plant these herbs—

1175
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,350
that unreliable business.

1176
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,880
I heard some people want to follow you and plant them too.

1177
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,710
Let me see who they are.

1178
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,390
I'm laying it out clearly today.

1179
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,750
I don't care about others.

1180
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,020
Fei Yinzi!

1181
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,970
You're my tenant, right?

1182
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,510
You plant on my land, right?

1183
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,060
My land can only grow grain,

1184
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,500
not herbs.

1185
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,660
If I see a single herb on my land,

1186
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,800
I'll chop it down.

1187
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
If you don't obey,

1188
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,030
forget planting on my land.

1189
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,720
You promised us a permanent tenancy.

1190
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,010
You can't take it back.

1191
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,750
Exactly.

1192
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,670
Their land is already under permanent tenancy.

1193
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,540
But it's still my land.

1194
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,380
By the Ning family rules,

1195
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,650
no herbs can be planted in my land,

1196
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,880
especially salvia miltiorrhiza.

1197
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,460
Luckily,

1198
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,800
this land belongs to the Feng family.

1199
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,860
No one with the surname Ning is allowed to touch the herbs.

1200
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,450
What kind of rule is that?

1201
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,910
Please tell me.

1202
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,350
What kind of rule is it?

1203
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,050
The Ning family rules.

1204
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,200
Take back this surname of mine.

1205
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,380
I don't care.

1206
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,100
Xiuxiu,

1207
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,100
you're taking good advice as bad.

1208
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,460
If you don't plant grain on good land,

1209
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,750
Heaven will punish you.

1210
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,270
When misfortune strikes,

1211
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,310
don't say I didn't warn you.

1212
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,150
In-law, you're leaving just like that?

1213
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,710
Listen.

1214
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,070
My in-law think the same

1215
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,390
as I do.

1216
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,140
Dig them up.

1217
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,280
We've already planted half of them. What are you doing?

1218
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,180
What am I doing?

1219
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,910
You're just an ignorant woman.

1220
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,460
Dajiao,

1221
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,610
your father-in-law just left.

1222
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,980
He said this land

1223
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,350
cannot grow herbs.

1224
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,580
Father,

1225
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,310
I heard everything.

1226
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,790
Now listen to me.

1227
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,360
These are already planted.

1228
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,390
Digging them up would be a waste.

1229
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,180
Xiuxiu said

1230
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,940
selling these herbs

1231
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,520
will not only cover the cost of the grain you want to plant

1232
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,570
but also bring extra profit.

1233
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,240
This year it's planted, so let it be.

1234
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,370
Starting next year,

1235
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,870
you can plant whatever you want on the Turtle Hill—

1236
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,530
everything is up to you, okay?

1237
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,190
If anyone dares to make trouble again,

1238
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,330
I won't tolerate it.
