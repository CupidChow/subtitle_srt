00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,880
Oh, my dear Susu!

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,509
You can't just tell me

5
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,210
that Wendian has been rescued.

6
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:49,640
How

7
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,820
was he rescued? How was his condition?

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,950
Where is he now?

9
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,590
Tell me more details!

10
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,250
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

11
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
He's fine, nothing serious.

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,210
But he won't be back anytime soon.

13
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,840
He's gone to do something important.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,170
He wants you
to take good care of yourself.

15
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,070
And also...

16
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,400
What else?

17
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,150
He asked me to take good care of you.

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,610
As if he needed to say that!

19
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,380
You take much better care of me
than he does.

20
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,750
He comes and goes as he pleases,

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,150
always making trouble for us

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,310
and this family.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,590
You haven't eaten, have you?

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,320
I'll make you something to eat.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Thank you, my neighbours,

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,420
for gracing my humble home today,

27
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,810
firstly, to celebrate my youngest son
Keyu's birthday,

28
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,910
and secondly,

29
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,079
to celebrate my eldest son

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,120
Kejin's upcoming promotion.

31
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,120
Everyone here is a friend

32
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,720
and close neighbour of mine.

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,320
Let me first

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,210
raise a glass to all of you.

35
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,280
Alright, alright.

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,800
Cheers to Father.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,280
You're still strong in his golden years!

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,480
Congratulations on your precious son.

39
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm not drinking.

40
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,250
Yinzi doesn't allow me to.

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,910
Our Ning family

42
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,560
has worked diligently in Ox Temple Village

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,630
for generations

44
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,680
and acquired a humble home
and a sliver of land.

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,690
It's all thanks to heaven's blessing

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,000
as well as the support and help
from everyone here.

47
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,470
As you all can see,

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,750
my eldest son Kejin

49
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,630
will soon be promoted to

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,970
the head of the county militia bureau.

51
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,000
Good!

52
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,620
And with our newborn,

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,130
weâ€™re already dreaming of greatness.

54
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,960
In the near future,

55
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,000
our Ning family will surely

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,000
prosper and flourish.

57
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,360
Then,

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,430
we'll host another feast for you guests.

59
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,270
Good! Good!

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,470
Cheers!

61
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,830
Come, congratulations!

62
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,079
Don't get your new clothes dirty
sitting here.

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,500
Wait, wait, just a little longer.

64
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,600
Just a little longer.

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,240
Master.

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,160
Come, eat up, eat up.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,820
Glutton Fei and his family are here,
at the door.

68
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,190
Give them some food and send them away.

69
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,610
Tell them to come again
in a few days to visit their child.

70
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,920
It's not convenient today.

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,600
No, Master,

72
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,000
he brought his son
for the hair-cutting ceremony.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,260
I can't turn them away.

74
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,620
What hair-cutting ceremony?
We don't need them for that.

75
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,630
Come take a look!

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,360
-Our Young Master is here.
-Shoo them away.

77
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,240
The moment he was born,

78
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,870
my father already had a name
picked out for him,

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,070
which is Keyu.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,870
Who are you trying to shoo away?

81
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,920
Who's at the door?

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,730
What a jolly fat boy!

83
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,460
Kuangzi.

84
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:02,920
Come, look over here.

85
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
There are guests at the door.

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,490
Invite them in! Invite them in!

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,220
Who's that?

88
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,600
Little boy.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,660
So fair and chubby. What a pretty boy.

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,950
Kuangzi.

91
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,280
Master asks you to go in.

92
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,120
Really?

93
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,360
Hurry.

94
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,750
Come on, let's go.

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,190
Sister.

96
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,450
Father, Mother.

97
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,310
Congratulations! Best wishes.

98
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,870
Where's the baby?

99
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,410
Lianye.

100
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,710
Come, take a look.

101
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,250
The baby's name is Keyu.

102
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,070
Keyu.

103
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,870
Look at him.

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,470
Shuanzhu, come here.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,560
Come, let's cut his hair.

106
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Time to cut his hair!

107
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,670
Uncle arrives, and the baby smiles.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,430
A snip of baby's hair
keeps all illnesses away.

109
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,300
You're an uncle now.

110
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,500
Look!

111
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,560
Young Master, please come to the door.

112
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,190
Come, please have a seat.

113
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,750
Sit down.

114
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,720
Please sit here, come.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,360
Please have a seat.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Come this way.

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
This way, please.

118
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
This is an official letter
from Commander Bian,

119
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,010
which I was instructed to deliver to you
personally.

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,110
Please come inside.

121
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,580
No need,

122
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
I have urgent matters to attend to.
I'll take my leave.

123
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,430
Take care.

124
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,270
Dear nephew Kejin,

125
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,570
upon receiving this appointment letter,

126
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,730
you are to immediately bring
your capable officers

127
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,510
cross the Shu River,

128
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,650
and report to
the Southern Shandong Militia.

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,680
Through my recommendation,

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,720
once you report for duty,

131
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,290
you will be promoted to
an appropriate position.

132
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,160
This opportunity must not be missed,

133
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,600
I hope you will depart immediately.

134
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,270
My son.

135
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,910
You're going to make it big.

136
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,950
Your father supports you
in achieving great things.

137
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,600
My son!

138
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,630
The time to bring honour
to our Ning family ancestors has come.

139
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
This is a good opportunity, Father.

140
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,920
But it's just happening too fast.

141
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,430
I

142
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,950
haven't prepared at all.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
What's there to prepare?

144
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,020
Military orders are immovable
like mountains.

145
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,520
I don't want you to leave either.

146
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,750
If you go,

147
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,480
it'll be like losing half my strength.

148
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,070
But I cannot...

149
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,680
I can't stand in the way

150
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,930
of your future at this moment.

151
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,600
My son,

152
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,400
these are turbulent times,

153
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,160
quickly align yourself with the right people

154
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,820
and establish your position.

155
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,480
When you have power,

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
you can return

157
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,610
to protect your father

158
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,960
and our Ning family.

159
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,870
Then I'll go prepare right away.

160
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,130
Father,

161
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,549
I kowtow to you.

162
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,840
My son,

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,140
take care of yourself.

164
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,210
Yinzi,

165
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,910
bring my child in.

166
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,020
What happened?

167
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,290
My son, Keyu.

168
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,680
You've just turned one month old,
and your brother is leaving.

169
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,940
Your brother is going to do great things,

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,960
to bring honor to our family.

171
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,100
My little Keyu, grow up quickly.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,200
When you're grown, stick by your father

173
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,910
and help make our Ning family

174
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,230
greater,

175
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,010
wealthier,

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
and more prosperous.

177
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,920
I think you're drunk,

178
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,440
talking such nonsense.

179
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,160
Isn't that right, Keyu?

180
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,320
Let father hold you.

181
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,810
Father is holding you.

182
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,550
Here.

183
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,810
["Feng Zicheng"]

184
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,270
Everyone, write your own name once.

185
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,560
Sit up straight.

186
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,290
Write the characters nice and straight.

187
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,130
["Feng Zicheng"]

188
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,290
That's great!

189
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,050
I can finally write my name.

190
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,080
You wrote it really well.

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
I'll go show it to my brother.

192
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,320
Your brother is at Fourth Grandpa's house.
Go ahead.

193
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,520
Then I'll go find him.

194
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,780
I see Meiwei's personality has changed.

195
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,550
That's really wonderful.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,910
Xiuxiu!

197
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,750
Sister-in-law.

198
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,440
Hurry and talk some sense
into your brother.

199
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,630
He's about to leave.

200
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,550
Where is he going?

201
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,240
Uncle Bian from the provincial capital

202
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,100
said he was recommended to join
the Southern Shandong Militia.

203
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,240
He brought over ten of his men

204
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,550
and went straight to the village entrance.

205
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,460
Going to war in times like these.

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
Isn't that a death sentence?

207
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,960
I'll go take a look.

208
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,750
Go quickly.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
Calm down.

210
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,720
I need to hurry back,

211
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,450
everything's in chaos at home.

212
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,080
Have you seen my brother, Ning Kejin?

213
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,690
I just saw him with a few men

214
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,870
riding fast horses
heading out of the village.

215
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,470
I don't think you can catch up with him
anymore.

216
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,280
Brother!

217
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,480
Your family's wheat

218
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,080
is at least 30% less than previous years.

219
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,390
Take good care of your younger brother.

220
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,320
You saw my family's fields yesterday,

221
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
we've lost more than 30%.

222
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
In a year of disaster,

223
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,400
this is considered not bad.

224
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,840
My father told me,

225
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,150
one year, after a drought
came a locust plague.

226
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,270
After a swarm of locusts passes through,

227
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,550
there's nothing left to harvest.

228
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,880
Not even grass or trees.

229
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,960
The farmers don't even have
a place to cry.

230
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,080
Father.

231
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,750
You've just recovered from your cold.

232
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,470
You're still weak. You shouldn't be working.

233
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,390
We don't need you.

234
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,690
Uncle, we have enough people here,

235
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,550
please go rest.

236
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,960
Yes, Uncle, please take a break.

237
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,110
I've recovered.

238
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm completely recovered and you want me to rest?

239
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,650
That just makes me anxious.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,080
Besides,

241
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,600
I've taken my medicine.

242
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,690
Harvesting wheat,

243
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,810
I can just do it slowly, can't I?

244
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,600
If you really want to work,

245
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
join the aunties later

246
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,850
to make straw ropes.

247
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,320
Everyone, take a break.

248
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,520
Come have some water.

249
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,090
It's tied up.

250
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,770
-All done.
-All done.

251
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,200
Good.

252
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,700
Take it easy, Father.

253
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,660
Let's go!

254
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,550
I'm full.

255
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,270
Grandson, remember this.

256
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,670
The best food in the world is dumplings.

257
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,220
The second best

258
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,270
is

259
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,320
wheat porridge.

260
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,220
I got it, Grandpa.

261
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,140
Kela.

262
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,720
Come back for dinner.

263
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
We've eaten here,

264
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,410
go ahead with your meal.

265
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,490
Alright.

266
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,640
You've practically raised Kela
for Silly Tiao.

267
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Our wheat

268
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,930
will be finished harvesting in a few days.

269
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,960
Those with more land will need to work
for a few more days.

270
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,510
Fine.

271
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,500
After we finish this busy period,

272
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,830
I'll go look at some land

273
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,750
and buy two or three mu.

274
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,750
Now,

275
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,120
we have more mouths to feed,

276
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
so we need more land.

277
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,670
Sure.

278
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,430
I'll company you to look around.

279
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,570
It doesn't matter if it's far,

280
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,030
as long as the land is good.

281
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,720
Father,

282
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
I was thinking

283
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,070
we shouldn't rush to thresh the wheat.

284
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,900
I'll go work as a labourer
for a few more days.

285
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,450
Sure, I'll go with you.

286
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,960
You shouldn't go.

287
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,940
You've just recovered
for a couple of days.

288
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,140
Wait till I come back,

289
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
and thresh the wheat with you.

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,670
What do you mean? You look down on me?

291
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,100
I'm good at threshing wheat too!

292
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,150
Father,

293
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,270
Dajiao is concerned about you.

294
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,790
You should rest instead of
doing labor work.

295
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,960
I can't rest! The more I rest,
the sicker I get!

296
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,820
Have you finished eating?

297
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't worry about it.

298
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,270
I'll clean everything up later,

299
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,410
take these two to learn some characters.

300
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,770
Come on, let's go.

301
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Xiu will teach you some characters.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,510
Dajiao, when you finish eating,

303
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,750
come join us to learn some too.

304
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,470
You still can't write your own name.

305
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,850
Always making me learn to read,

306
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,380
what's the use of it anyway?

307
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,700
What use is it, you ask?

308
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,120
Your wife can read and draw.

309
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,930
You should learn from her.

310
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,550
Your father is right.

311
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,360
Uncle, Aunt.

312
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,820
Zhuzi is here.

313
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,320
You're drinking barley soup?

314
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,370
Here.

315
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,410
Have some.

316
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,910
I'm done eating.

317
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,630
No thanks.

318
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,480
Drink some.

319
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,760
Do you need something?

320
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,060
Thank you, Aunt.

321
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,100
Dajiao.

322
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,550
I want to discuss something with you.

323
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,960
I've got a wheat harvesting job.

324
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,770
Don't know if you're interested.

325
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,070
I'm recruiting people,
and I still need two more.

326
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,790
Said he'd pay half a Jiao
for a day's reaping,

327
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,640
Meals included. You want in?

328
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,640
Go.

329
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,930
Go, go, go.

330
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,620
Dajiao and I were just talking about this.

331
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,930
It's settled then.

332
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,150
No need to find anyone else.

333
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,270
That's great!

334
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,330
I needed to find five people.

335
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,360
Now we have enough.

336
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,630
So we'll meet at Zaojiao Ridge tomorrow morning.

337
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,490
Zaojiao Ridge?

338
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,630
Whose land is it?

339
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,440
Kuangzi told me.

340
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,440
Should be Ning Xuexiang's.

341
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,180
We can't

342
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,360
go to Ning Xuexiang's land, can we?

343
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,160
Let's go.

344
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,760
Why not?

345
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,220
What's the reason not to go?

346
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,350
Why shouldn't we go?

347
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,750
They're paying, right?

348
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,440
Yes, they are.

349
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,210
Meals included, right?

350
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,850
Of course.

351
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
I'm definitely going.

352
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,270
I'll do what my father says.

353
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,800
Alright.

354
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,230
I'll head over first then, Uncle.

355
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,030
Father.

356
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,770
We're working for Ning Xuexiang.

357
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,330
We can't let Xiu know this.

358
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,600
This matter

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,060
can't be known to your mother either.

360
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,480
You shouldn't go.

361
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,540
Why shouldn't I go?

362
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,870
Well then.

363
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm skipping this meal.

364
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,170
Aren't they feeding us tomorrow morning?

365
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,030
I'll skip dinner too.

366
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,420
Save your appetite.

367
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Eat him bankrupt!

368
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,860
Drink him penniless!

369
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,230
I'm going to sharpen the sickle.

370
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,910
Uncle, Dajiao.

371
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,880
You're here.

372
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,000
Everyone's here now.

373
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,690
All here.

374
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,540
Why isn't the food here yet?

375
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,830
How can we work without eating?

376
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,820
It should be here soon.

377
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,150
Here it comes.

378
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,700
Master.

379
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Everyone's here.

380
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,550
Everyone's here.

381
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,480
You're all here?

382
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,369
Master Ning,

383
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,990
Youâ€™re all here.

384
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,790
Yes.

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,550
Kuangzi.

386
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,880
Didn't I ask you to bring
five skilled workers?

387
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,220
Why are there only three?

388
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,020
They're here.

389
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,859
Over there.

390
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,320
My son-in-law came to help me?

391
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,070
Look who's here!

392
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,750
Isn't this my in-law?

393
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,290
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

394
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,660
Come to help me, have you?

395
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,900
Well isn't that heartwarming.

396
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,510
And mine feels ice cold.

397
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,320
Where's the food?

398
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,450
We're making it now.

399
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,350
We're making it at home right now.

400
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,410
Definitely enough for everyone.

401
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,980
Take a look.

402
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,790
My son-in-law is so excellent.

403
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,740
Master,

404
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,270
when will the meal be served?

405
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,680
I didn't eat anything last night.

406
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm starving

407
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,920
and have no strength left, Master.

408
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,680
Isn't the rule

409
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,750
supposed to be like this?

410
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,030
Three meals a day.

411
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,880
And then

412
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,580
half a Jiao, right?

413
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,220
Others can do that,

414
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,070
but you can't lecture me about rules.

415
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,750
My son Kejin went off to make his fortune,

416
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,340
and left you this good militia job.

417
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,240
That's because he treats you like family.

418
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
Master, aren't I

419
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,460
not

420
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,040
in the same situation as Kejin?

421
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,900
I need to make a living too, right?

422
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,310
He's right.

423
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,080
He needs to make a living.

424
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,830
What are you squatting here for?

425
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,630
Taking a dump?

426
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,070
For food!

427
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,600
Kuangzi.

428
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,170
Go serve the food.

429
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,720
Alright, just a moment.

430
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,900
Yes, just a moment.

431
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,960
Let's get started.

432
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,110
Coming.

433
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,640
Here's your tip.

434
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,460
Help me fetch some water.

435
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,940
Okay.

436
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,210
This isn't enough to eat.

437
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,790
Fine.

438
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,130
I'll leave the food for you all.

439
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,610
I'm going home to eat.

440
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,270
He's such a Miser Ning.

441
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,410
He sweats when eating others' food,

442
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,470
but cries when eating his own.

443
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,010
This tiny portion,

444
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,850
who could possibly be full from this?

445
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,810
Don't worry.

446
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,590
I specially made soup with
dried sweet potatoes.

447
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
This is soup?

448
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,000
It's so clear you can see your reflection
in it.

449
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:08,890
Father.

450
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,920
If you've finished eating,

451
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,850
go home and rest.

452
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm fine.

453
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,310
How can you be?

454
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,770
You haven't even finished half a row.

455
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,100
I think you're still not fully recovered.

456
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,590
This isn't your usual work pace.

457
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,550
Go home.

458
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,710
I'll do your work.

459
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,450
You'd better be prepared.

460
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,330
When he says you're helping,

461
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,860
it means you won't get paid.

462
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,130
Let's go together.

463
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,070
I'm not going back. You go ahead.

464
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,780
Son-in-law.

465
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,560
Take it easy.

466
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,190
Why is one person missing?

467
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,330
Where's my in-law?

468
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,590
A few days ago,

469
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
he caught a cold

470
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,070
and hasn't fully recovered yet,

471
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,800
so I told him to go home and rest.

472
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,000
If he has returned,

473
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,210
he won't get paid.

474
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,910
As if you were planning to pay
in the first place.

475
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,400
That's not what I meant, Dajiao.

476
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,370
We're all family here.

477
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,240
You help me, I help you.

478
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,720
Isn't that normal?

479
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,780
You should go back and rest too.

480
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,910
At your age, we can manage without you,

481
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,420
just sit and keep watch.

482
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm still fine,

483
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,190
not weak like your father.

484
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,710
I speak bluntly,

485
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,050
hope you don't mind.

486
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,170
You're planning to work with us

487
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,080
just to save some wages, right?

488
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,490
I don't want your money,

489
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,710
I'm just here to help.

490
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,750
I'll do more work,

491
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,510
and you

492
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,150
should take care of yourself.

493
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,750
Dajiao.

494
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,910
They say you're a person of few words,

495
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
but I think you're quite talkative.

496
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,230
Alright.

497
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,660
I'll listen to you,

498
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,130
I'll rest.

499
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,420
My son-in-law will work for me.

500
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,350
Also,

501
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,790
every household

502
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,390
is counting on the harvesting wages

503
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,850
to buy basic necessities.

504
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,130
You absolutely must not withhold
or underpay them.

505
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,380
And about the food,

506
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,070
you are clear of

507
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,440
what kind of work harvesting wheat is.

508
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,750
For the evening meal,

509
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,980
if it's still just black pancakes
and plain water soup,

510
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,560
that simply won't do.

511
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,610
Hand it over.

512
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,040
Is that what I'm talking about?

513
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,960
What?

514
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,790
What?

515
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,830
Word has spread.

516
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,930
You're making Feng Er and Feng Dajiao
harvest your wheat for free

517
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,210
and not even feeding them properly.

518
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,070
Ning Xuexiang,

519
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,380
are you really so short on money and food?

520
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,630
I'm truly embarrassed by you.

521
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,080
Aren't you going to stay in this village?

522
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,270
Aren't my son and I
staying in this village?

523
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,830
Hurry up.

524
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,300
Pay them their harvesting wages.

525
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,510
They're just helping out,
how could they ask for money?

526
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,510
You asked Zhuzi to find labour
to harvest your wheat,

527
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,240
and didn't he find them for you?

528
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,880
How did that turn into 'helping out'
in your words?

529
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,060
None of them are wealthy,

530
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,440
they just want to earn some money
for necessities.

531
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,300
I have no money.

532
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,700
Search me if you want, I have nothing.

533
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,440
Kuangzi.

534
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,580
Hand me Master's money bag.

535
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,470
Your left pocket.

536
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,880
Hand it over.

537
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,970
Take this

538
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,920
and deliver it to Feng Dajiao's family.

539
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,640
Go now.

540
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,260
Don't keep any.

541
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,420
Fine.

542
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,610
I won't keep any then, son.

543
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,310
It's not going to strangers anyway.

544
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,770
I gave it all to Xiuxiu.

545
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,800
He's happy!

546
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,950
I knew

547
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,210
they wouldn't pay us
for harvesting the wheat.

548
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,230
Sure enough, the money's gone.

549
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,280
All for nothing.

550
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,350
Let's not go tomorrow.

551
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,870
Did you two go to Master Ning's place

552
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,220
to harvest wheat today?

553
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,230
No.

554
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,050
No? Really?

555
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,740
Kuangzi brought the money back.

556
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,390
Yinzi had it delivered.

557
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,340
I have to say,

558
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,590
Yinzi is a reasonable person.

559
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,510
What's wrong, Father?

560
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,310
What's wrong?

561
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,400
What happened?

562
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,510
Father! Father!

563
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,110
Honey, what's wrong?

564
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,550
Father, what's wrong?

565
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,320
What's wrong, honey?

566
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,210
-Father! Father!
-Honey, what's wrong?

567
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,980
What happened?

568
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,160
Bring him back into the house now.

569
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,790
Slowly.

570
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,890
Honey,

571
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,310
what's going on with you?

572
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,890
Honey.

573
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,440
He's suffering from

574
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,270
stomach heat blocking meridians

575
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,400
and liver fire attacking the stomach.

576
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,270
His chronic condition is flaring up again.

577
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,200
If he had rested properly,

578
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,920
it wouldn't have become this serious.

579
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
But he's been overworking himself.

580
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,240
That's why

581
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,450
his old illness has been triggered.

582
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,950
Now he's deficient in both qi and blood.

583
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,960
Uncle Feng Er,

584
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,590
from today on you must rest well

585
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,560
and avoid any strenuous work.

586
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,290
I have other patients to see,
so I'll be going now.

587
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,550
Doctor,

588
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,240
did my father's illness

589
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,550
get more serious?

590
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,500
Make him some good food and drinks,

591
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,160
let him eat whatever he wants,

592
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,610
and see how he does with some rest.

593
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,450
What are you doing?

594
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,000
In here

595
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,310
is all the money

596
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,040
I've saved from selling herbs.

597
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,050
I want to use it all
to buy land for father.

598
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,640
When father feels better,

599
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,590
we'll take him to see the land.

600
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,240
Father,

601
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,320
it's time for your medicine.

602
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,120
Honey.

603
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,160
I'm here.

604
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,490
I just had a dream

605
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,350
about

606
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,510
the year when Dajiao was born,

607
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,430
before we split from Feng Si,

608
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,700
when we had that bumper harvest.

609
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,750
We had wheat covering all our fields.

610
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,950
I was bundling and bundling,

611
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,430
but couldn't finish it all.

612
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,410
I remember that.

613
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,510
Then

614
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,570
we sold the grain

615
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,110
and bought land.

616
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,720
My father told me happily.

617
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,160
"Son,

618
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,350
we have our own land now.

619
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,350
From now on,

620
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,400
we won't need to rent from the landlords
anymore."

621
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,550
My father

622
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,080
left me 18 mu of land.

623
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,510
But in my generation,

624
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,530
I've been useless.

625
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,480
Grain prices are too low,

626
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,690
and we still have to pay taxes.

627
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,590
I've made you all

628
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,490
live such a

629
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,440
hard and difficult life.

630
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,510
How can you say that?

631
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,230
We may be living frugally,

632
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,130
but we've never gone hungry.

633
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,060
I think our life is pretty good.

634
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,110
Father,

635
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,790
it's because of you

636
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,760
that we've never gone hungry.

637
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,440
Father,

638
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,510
I bought land.

639
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,550
Look here,

640
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,460
I bought back

641
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,870
3 mu of land

642
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,730
at Zaojiao Ridge

643
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,150
from Xuerui's Second Uncle
that you liked so much.

644
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,550
My son.

645
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,160
All my life,

646
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,310
I've wanted to give you

647
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,810
and my grandson.

648
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,030
more land,

649
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,200
but sadly,

650
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,030
I wasn't capable enough.

651
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,200
At this point,

652
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,650
I haven't left you much land.

653
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,510
But fortunately,

654
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,990
we now have these additional 3 mu.

655
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,760
Including Turtle Hill,

656
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,550
our family now has

657
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,600
23 mu of land.

658
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,330
23 mu of land now!

659
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,150
That's wonderful.

660
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:00,980
Son.

661
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,830
Farm the land well.

662
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,030
While I still have

663
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,030
some strength left.

664
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,350
Do you want to hear

665
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,340
about farming?

666
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,440
Yes.

667
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,210
There are 72 trades in the world.

668
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,180
And we are the farmers.

669
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,750
What does farming mean?

670
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,830
It means cultivating the land.

671
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,160
The old folks always say,

672
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,680
it takes ten years to become a scholar,

673
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,510
but even ten years

674
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,640
isn't enough to master farming.

675
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,640
Fields are our roots.

676
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,440
Land is our foundation.

677
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,270
The first rule of farming

678
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,240
is that you must

679
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,010
respect the land.

680
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,200
Good crops in the field

681
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,500
all depend on good manure.

682
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,440
If you don't use fertilizer properly,

683
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,620
a whole year's work is wasted.

684
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,240
Remember this.

685
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,940
Pig manure is rich.

686
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,790
Sheep manure is strong.

687
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,680
Cow manure is just a supplement.

688
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,240
Chicken manure

689
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,400
will damage the seedlings.

690
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,680
Thirty percent land,

691
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,680
seventy percent watering.

692
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,510
Manure is strength, and water is life.

693
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,830
If you fertilize without watering,

694
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,100
even the crops will pout.

695
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,270
Good milk makes babies plump.

696
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,680
Good water

697
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,190
makes seedlings strong.

698
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,440
Land is like your parents' face,

699
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,670
you should see it three times a day.

700
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,650
You can't disrespect your parents,

701
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,870
and you certainly can't disrespect
your land.

702
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,290
When you stand on the land,

703
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,070
whether you're kind to it,

704
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,960
or sincere with it,

705
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,770
it knows in its heart.

706
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,950
If you're kind

707
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,850
and sincere to it,

708
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,300
it will reward you

709
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,290
with a good harvest.

710
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,230
Tomorrow...

711
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,630
What day is tomorrow?

712
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,640
Father.

713
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,270
Tomorrow is the autumn equinox.

714
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,680
Autumn Equinox.

715
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,660
The Autumn Equinox is wonderful.

716
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,750
It's my favourite time of year.

717
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,940
Time to harvest the crops

718
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,770
and plant wheat.

719
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,590
I love it the most.

720
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,930
â™ª The moon leans gently over the valley, â™ª

721
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,280
I made it.

722
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,570
â™ª Showing me this weathered land. â™ª

723
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,430
I made it.

724
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,810
â™ª Years rise and fall like the tides â™ª

725
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,400
I made it.

726
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,090
â™ª Yet here, my heart finds home â™ª

727
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,400
â™ª All things grow and fade in season, â™ª

728
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,240
â™ª But life's dance never ends â™ª

729
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,490
â™ª Such radiance â™ª

730
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:52,140
â™ª Where I and all living things â™ª

731
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:49,750
Father.

732
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,550
â™ª Race toward the vast unknown â™ª

733
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,020
â™ª Our sweat soaking time's satchel â™ª

734
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,470
â™ª How long a life must stretch â™ª

735
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,230
â™ª I measure it in golden grain â™ª

736
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,219
â™ª Light a lantern, look back â™ª

737
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,520
â™ª The land's rings etch
the mountains' spine â™ª

738
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,020
â™ª Holding up the undying sun â™ª

739
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,750
â™ª Gifting us spring light
and wheat waves â™ª

740
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,280
[1943, 32nd year of the Republic of China,
during the solar term of Xiaoman]

741
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,880
Shortly after my father-in-law left,

742
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,210
the Japanese came.

743
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,610
They started looting our food,

744
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,370
and took away our only ox.

745
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,460
Burning, killing, and looting
became our daily reality.

746
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,170
Year three of the Japanese invasionâ€”

747
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,260
they took a liking to our fields
around Tianniu Temple,

748
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,700
-and built their farm.
-Father.

749
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,370
Father! There are planes!

750
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,750
Don't be afraid, Jiaying.

751
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,370
Father and I will protect you.

752
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,810
Father, I'm scared.

753
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,680
Don't be afraid.

754
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,480
Stop digging.

755
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,990
Let's go home.

756
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,550
Mother must be worried.

757
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,350
Jiaming, come on, let's go home.

758
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,060
The Japanese gave us a debt note,

759
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,160
took all our fields into their farm,

760
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,900
and we could only grow wheat and peanuts
as they demanded.

761
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,960
After each harvest,

762
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,390
they'd take our good grain

763
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,710
and exchange it for

764
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,480
stale mixed flour
that even pigs and dogs wouldn't eat.

765
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,400
My daughter Jiaying
is already seven years old,

766
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,980
and this little girl

767
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,670
has grown up in these difficult times.

768
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,510
Wife!

769
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,150
Zhuzi!

770
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,530
Wife!

771
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,880
It's alright,

772
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,340
don't be afraid, I'm here.

773
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,660
Zhuzi,

774
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,230
get down and don't move.

775
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,990
I'll go check.

776
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,460
Be careful!

777
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:25,920
Hurry home.

778
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,840
Be careful!

779
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,610
Grandma!

780
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,760
Grandma!

781
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,430
Mother!

782
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,440
You're back, you're back.

783
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,400
Where's Meiwei? Isn't he with you?

784
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,060
He went to chop firewood.
He should be back soon.

785
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,700
Are you alright, child?

786
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,340
Second Auntie.

787
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,400
You're back.
Quickly put down the firewood.

788
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,800
Put it down.

789
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,960
It's good that you're back.

790
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,220
I can finally relax now that you're home.

791
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,690
Even if I die,

792
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,200
I need to see you all safe before my eyes.

793
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,910
Mother, don't say such unlucky things.

794
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,320
That's right, Second Auntie.

795
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,110
I'm grown up now,

796
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,250
I can take care of myself.

797
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,850
Hurry to the kitchen and eat.

798
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,260
Listen, you two,

799
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,080
when your father goes to the fields
tomorrow,

800
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,960
you two stay here, don't follow him.

801
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,440
Stay with Grandma,

802
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,230
and if the Japanese come bombing again,

803
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,110
we'll hide in the sweet potato cellar.

804
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,800
Grandma,

805
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,880
I still want to keep watch.

806
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,370
How can I keep watch
from the potato cellar?

807
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,070
If you're keeping watch,
you must keep your ears perked up,

808
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,990
find a good hiding spot first,

809
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,550
and as soon as you hear planes,
hide quickly.

810
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,440
Remember that.

811
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,490
I will.

812
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,800
Good, let's go.

813
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,590
Go to the kitchen for dinner.

814
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:27,960
Hurry up.

815
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Go to the kitchen.

816
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,890
Where's Dajiao?

817
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,840
Zhuzi's wife injured her leg,

818
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,460
and Humpback Guo's donkey was killed
in the bombing,

819
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
so he went to help.

820
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,890
What kind of world have we come to?

821
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,950
I keep thinking about your father.

822
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
He's luckier than me.

823
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,350
He's at peace now

824
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,610
at a better place.

825
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,440
Let's not talk about this, Mother.

826
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,360
I believe that sooner or later,

827
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,160
we'll drive those Japanese devils out.

828
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,510
We will.

829
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,320
Definitely.

830
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,300
I believe you, Xiu, I believe you.

831
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,150
I just feel that

832
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,320
my two grandchildren

833
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,230
are suffering so much.

834
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,550
Since these Japanese devils came,

835
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,030
what kind of life are we living?

836
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,360
Eating that mixed dough

837
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,790
that even pigs and dogs wouldn't touch.

838
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,540
When will they ever get to
have some white flour?

839
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,190
When we harvest wheat
this Grain in Ear season,

840
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,440
no matter what

841
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,980
I'll make the children
some wheat porridge.

842
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,060
During harvest time,

843
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,390
those Japanese watch us closer than dogs.

844
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,760
You'll have to gather wheat ears

845
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,020
to make that porridge.

846
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,410
It won't be easy.

847
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,720
I'll go early

848
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,880
and gather more.

849
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,610
What kind of world is this?

850
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,670
The grain we grow ourselves,

851
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,800
our children can't even eat.

852
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,550
Xiu!

853
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,320
Xiu!

854
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,190
Hurry!

855
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,840
Quick, get me some medicine
to stop the bleeding!

856
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,960
The powder I have at home isn't working.

857
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,710
It won't stop!

858
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,710
Wait here, Kejin.

859
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,910
Auntie, look,

860
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,400
it won't stop bleeding!

861
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,590
Hurry, hurry!

862
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,030
Quick!

863
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,840
Apply it, quick!

864
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,030
Okay.

865
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,590
Apply it and go,

866
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,360
all of you go!

867
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,550
Jiaming! Jiaming!

868
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,160
Come on, let's go inside.

869
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,280
Jiaming.

870
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,880
Take half a corn bun with you.

871
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,910
Give it to Kela.

872
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,470
Thanks.

873
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,070
Susu,

874
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,980
come out and put on some mud.

875
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,890
Sister-in-law,

876
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
should I put it on my face too?

877
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,640
My face can hardly get any paler anyway.

878
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,700
Better put it on.

879
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,960
Even if it won't wash white,

880
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,150
it's safer to look dirty.

881
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,880
Who knows when those Japanese devils
will go crazy again?

882
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,960
They could show up anytime.

883
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,360
We can always put it on
when we hear the gong.

884
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,690
That's true.

885
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,510
I don't know why,

886
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,440
but my heart

887
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,590
just feels uneasy.

888
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,190
Wendian

889
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,670
hasn't sent a letter for half a year,
has he?

890
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,430
Since I learned
Wendian is fighting the Japanese,

891
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,990
I've been hoping he'd come back.

892
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,640
I want him to come back,

893
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,970
but I'm also afraid of him returning.

894
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,070
Look at this!

895
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,840
It's too late, isn't it?

896
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,970
Don't worry, the gong hasn't sounded.

897
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,360
Susu, Mrs. Fei.

898
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,030
I'm Guo Guiyao.

899
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,350
Humpback Guo.

900
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,110
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.
I'll get the door.

901
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,540
That scared me to death.

902
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,730
Humpback Guo, what brings you here?

903
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:16,190
Where's Sister-in-law? I have urgent news.

904
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,510
Sister-in-law,
something terrible has happened.

905
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,150
What is it?

906
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,590
I went to town this morning

907
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,280
to buy medicine for my donkey.

908
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,530
On the way, I saw the Japanese soldiers
conscripting men.

909
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,330
Beard Liu and Qing from your household
were taken away.

910
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,600
Beard Liu struggled with the Japanese,

911
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,560
and nearly got his head split open.

912
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,510
Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law.

913
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,710
Sister-in-law, don't panic.

914
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,510
Humpback Guo.

915
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,660
Aren't they just taking men
for labor work?

916
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,690
Won't they be sent back
once the work is done?

917
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,960
There's no guarantee.

918
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,690
Some return after building watchtowers.

919
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,870
But that's rare.

920
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,600
Some have to build several.

921
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,510
Others are forced to dig trenches.

922
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,570
With bullets flying all around them.

923
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,790
Third Uncle Wu's son

924
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,550
was taken away just like that, wasn't he?

925
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,750
It's been five years with no sign of him.

926
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,600
It's all my fault.

927
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,150
I shouldn't have let them go pawn things.

928
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,440
I was just thinking about all those

929
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,760
porcelain pieces and clocks

930
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,280
and silver candlesticks we have.

931
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
They're not for eating or drinking,

932
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,150
so exchanging them for money
seemed like a good idea.

933
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,170
How could this happen?

934
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,230
Don't blame yourself too much.

935
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,490
This isn't your fault.

936
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,190
Blame those damn Japanese devils.

937
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,280
Both of them taken together.

938
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,190
If something happens to them,

939
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,880
wouldn't I be the one to blame?

940
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,070
Sister-in-law. Don't be afraid!

941
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,090
nothing bad will happen.

942
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,890
What if they just build a watchtower
and come back?

943
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,710
These Japanese are going crazy
grabbing people off the streets.

944
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,870
From what I can see,

945
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,650
once taken, it's not easy to return.

946
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,530
If you ask me,

947
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,290
with just you two left in this compound,

948
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,760
don't go out unless necessary.

949
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,740
Barricade the main gate

950
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,470
and use the side door if needed.

951
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,250
Taking care of yourselves
is the priority now.

952
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,870
I understand. You'd better go now.

953
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,730
Mrs. Fei, don't worry too much,

954
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,660
perhaps it'll be just as Susu said.

955
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,650
They might be back in a few days.

956
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,280
I just wanted to bring you the news.

957
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,880
Nothing else, I'll be going.

958
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,170
Susu.

959
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,530
With Qing and Beard Liu taken away,

960
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,240
and Xiaoqin having already

961
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,170
fled home scared of the Japanese,

962
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,120
Now there're just the two of us
left in this house.

963
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,000
Humpback Guo is right.

964
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,320
We need to secure the main gate properly.

965
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,630
Sister-in-law. Don't be afraid!

966
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,360
Even if the sky falls,
I'll hold it up for you.

967
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,090
I'll go barricade the door now.

968
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,910
I need to burn incense

969
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,910
and pray to our ancestors
to bless their quick return.

970
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,880
Father, are you ready?

971
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,590
Keyu.

972
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,480
Hello, Father. Hello, Mother.

973
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:52,780
Hello, Father.

974
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,380
Take this.

975
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,960
Japanese devils!

976
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,730
Kill!

977
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,600
Child, you can't say such things.

978
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,190
If the Japanese hear you,

979
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,530
our family will be in trouble.

980
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,010
What?

981
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,320
Can't my son even speak freely
in our own courtyard?
