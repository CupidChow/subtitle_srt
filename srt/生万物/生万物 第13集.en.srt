00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,910
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,350
How... Xiu...

4
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,720
I thought I was too late when I saved you.

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,570
But those bandits didn’t
lay a finger on you.

6
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,770
You're... unharmed.

7
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,250
What else could it be...

8
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,680
Back then, my father

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
left me to rot in that bandits' lair.

10
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,660
I made up those stories

11
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,090
just to see if he even cared.

12
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,270
To test whether he still
cared for  his own daughter.

13
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,360
Why would you humiliate yourself?

14
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,160
See what you've gone through for this!

15
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,140
Let me talk to them!

16
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,560
Lie down...

17
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,870
Lie down!

18
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,730
Who exactly are you going to tell?

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Are you going to
stand on a stage and shout,

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,579
"My Xiuxiu wasn't harmed
by those bandits"?

21
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,760
Dajiao,

22
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,430
those who cared already showed it.

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,780
And those who don't...

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,860
no words will ever matter.

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
I just feel...

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,530
after all you've suffered,

27
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,240
we have to make them pay.

28
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,000
This isn't something revenge can fix.

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,079
Then why...

30
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,800
You always say

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,220
I'm the closest person to you.

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960
But why didn't you tell me sooner?

33
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,620
You never once looked down on me.

34
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,430
It makes no difference

35
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,900
whether I tell you or not.

36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,240
Besides...

37
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,540
I promised to keep it secret for someone.

38
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,560
Secret?

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,710
For whom?

40
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,450
When I was trapped in that bandits' lair,

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,430
it was Guo who risked his life

42
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,440
and snuck me out with the food deliveries.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,260
That's how I came to you...

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,750
You've actually met him.

45
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,030
That night—

46
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,120
the man I kicked down...

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,740
Letting hostages escape from bandits' lair

48
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,680
means death by a thousand cuts.

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,030
So...

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
just drop it.

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,240
Xiu...

52
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,910
you've been through so much,

53
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
keeping everything bottled up.

54
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,840
In the future,

55
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,080
we ought to thank Guo the way he deserves.

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,190
I believe...

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,130
this is your mother,

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,910
no,

59
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,010
our mother's kindness

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,800
flowing through you.

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,560
From this day on,

62
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,510
I'll walk every step

63
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,660
by your side,

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,190
shield you from harm,

65
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,790
and protect you forever.

66
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,560
Dajiao, Xiuxiu—rise and shine!

67
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,870
It's second moon's second day.

68
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,560
It's time to circle the granary!

69
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,890
-Mother.
-Mother.

70
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,920
I'd have forgotten without you!

71
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,850
Today is second moon's second day.

72
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,670
That's right.

73
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Here I come!

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,430
On Dragon's Day, we bang the pots.

75
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,360
Little mice, pack your lots!

76
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,750
Where to move? Don't you see?

77
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,210
To the rich man's granary!

78
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,800
Spare our crops; gnaw his gold.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,150
Eat that miser's storehouse cold!

80
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,750
Mother...

81
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,640
Xiuxiu... you know how, right?

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,920
Have you done this before?

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Can you manage it?

84
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,210
My mother used to circle it...

85
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,159
but the speech part was different.

86
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,560
So, what was your speech?

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,240
Come, come!

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,659
You will circle the granary.

89
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,790
Me? Do the circling?

90
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,010
But... you always lead it every year!

91
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,370
Things may change.

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
You're grown now.

93
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,270
It's time to shoulder the household.

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,310
No more gallivanting about.

95
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,420
You lead the circling,

96
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,480
and bring your wife with you.

97
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,120
If I'm to shoulder this household,

98
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,640
then my word rules.

99
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,270
Return the land to Tietou's family—
and I'll stay for good.

100
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,760
Suit yourself. Do it or don't—up to you.

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,570
Father never said no to returning it.

102
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,970
Let's stick to the granary circling today.

103
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,310
Fine, I'll do the circling!

104
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:12,910
Come, Xiu—

105
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,010
you lead the steps,

106
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,940
I'll follow you.

107
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:17,950
Here,

108
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,010
Xiu!

109
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,430
Bless the grain.

110
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:35,950
Let's go!

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,860
Easy there. Mind your arm!

112
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,310
Here.

113
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,600
Mother.

114
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,890
Say it.

115
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:54,920
Xiu.

116
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,270
You may proceed with your version.

117
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,410
Second moon's second day;

118
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,730
Dragon lifts its head;

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,510
Big barns brim full;

120
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,210
Small barns overflow;

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,560
Wheat piles high, grains carpet earth;

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,410
Gold and silver ingots sprout forth!

123
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,070
So nice!

124
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,850
Exactly!

125
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,970
Dragon's Day wakes the plow-oxen;

126
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,800
Spring tills, summer tends—earth's rhythm;

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,190
Hooves churn blessings through the soil;

128
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,630
Rains kind, winds mild—lucky season!

129
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,040
Granaries burst!

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,600
Harvests boom.

131
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,310
Granaries burst;

132
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,040
Harvests boom!

133
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:41,150
Harvests boom!

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,560
Harvests boom!

135
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,870
Harvests boom!

136
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,130
Granaries burst!

137
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,270
Granaries burst!

138
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,310
Harvests boom!

139
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,480
Harvests boom!

140
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,360
Granaries burst!

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,360
Granaries burst! Harvests boom!

142
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,070
Harvests boom!

143
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,870
Dragon lifts its head;

144
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,070
Big barns brim full; Small barns overflow;

145
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,730
Granaries overflow, fields drown in gold.

146
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,190
Coins sprout from the soil—
fortune unfolds!

147
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,270
Master,

148
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,480
you own so much land,

149
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,610
and we already have surplus grain.

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,300
Yet you still circle
such a massive granary.

151
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,700
How can you manage it all?

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,600
What nonsense!

153
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,880
I'm circling the granary here!

154
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,730
Besides,

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,200
who ever complained about too much grain?

156
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,200
If your jinxing words

157
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,200
reach passing gods' ears,

158
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,080
and come harvest

159
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,960
my granary isn't bursting,

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,720
I'll chop you up
and stuff you in with the wheat!

161
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,030
Oh mighty spirits!

162
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,390
All mighty spirits!
I was just babbling nonsense!

163
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,960
Treat me like passing wind!

164
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,630
I'm just a dumb child!

165
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,150
Don't let my master chop me up!

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,910
Thank you, sacred ones!

167
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Thank you! Thank you, all gods!

168
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,150
Thank you!

169
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,810
You honey-mouthed rat!

170
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,380
All appetite and flattery!

171
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm back!

172
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,270
Good heavens!

173
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,960
Father, why's the granary so huge?

174
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,150
Circling the granary was your job!

175
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,240
But you never came back,

176
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,280
so I had to do it myself!

177
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,480
I can't handle this job!

178
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,510
You know me.

179
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,270
I'm useless at fieldwork too!

180
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,360
Father!

181
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,200
Your son is meant for greatness!

182
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:36,910
See—

183
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,220
I've returned with glorious news!

184
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,530
Big talk again!

185
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,120
You vanish for days,

186
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,960
then swagger back with good news?

187
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,290
I should be thanking the gods
if you're not wanted by the law!

188
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,930
Look what I got you—

189
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,450
your favorite duck

190
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,000
from town!

191
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,530
Let's have a drink, just us two!

192
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,680
Kuangzi.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,130
Whip up some dishes!

194
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,150
Come on!

195
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,070
Let's go, Father!

196
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,630
All this fuss

197
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,370
for the Qingqi Society
and that so-called Director—

198
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,770
what'd they pay you?
A few coins? Some land?

199
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,840
Learn from your old man!

200
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,840
That Feng Si's land—

201
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,010
how stubborn he was!

202
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,440
"I won't sell it! No way!"

203
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,440
Till I wore him down to nothing!

204
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,120
Father, can we please

205
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,790
stop measuring everything
in acres and coins?

206
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,790
That brain of yours—

207
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,080
always churning soil and silver!

208
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,600
What your son's doing now

209
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,870
will shake the heaven and earth!

210
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,990
Don't get cocky.

211
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,540
The winds aren't blowing our way now.

212
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,990
Stirring up trouble?

213
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,250
Watch your step—

214
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,390
back the wrong horse,

215
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,250
and you'll choke on the consequences.

216
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,320
Listen, Father—

217
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,090
the times are changing for real.

218
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,700
They say

219
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
when the Farmers' Association
comes to our village,

220
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,390
they'll demand permanent tenancy,

221
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,000
rent reduction, interest cuts—
maybe even land redistribution!

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
You need to take a stand.

223
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,320
What stand?

224
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,600
This land came from my ancestors!

225
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
You think some upstarts can just steal it?

226
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,670
Since when does the world work that way?

227
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,510
They won't debate ancestors with you!

228
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,870
They'll just say: "You stole this land".

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
What are you going to do about it?

230
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,750
Which of your muddled eyes

231
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,870
saw me steal land?

232
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,190
Can't you tell good advice from bad?

233
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,620
I'm trying to protect you!

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Relax!

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
I went to the county seat,

236
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,790
and talked to all our old-timers

237
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,390
who once held influence.

238
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,510
The current situation is

239
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,270
just another power shift.

240
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,370
Like a gust of wind

241
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,650
that sweeps through the city outskirts.

242
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,850
It might not even reach us.

243
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,700
But you—you better watch out.

244
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,570
Now is not the time to stir up issues!

245
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,580
The Northern Expedition Army—

246
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,080
you know what their revolution really is?

247
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
Their battle cry is

248
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,910
"Smash the corrupt landlords!"

249
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,790
But who's corrupt, and who's a landlord?

250
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,480
That's up to them!

251
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,130
Don't think just
because you joined their cause,

252
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
you're safe from their lists!

253
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,870
True, you're right.

254
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,960
Listen here—

255
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,370
you'll do as I say.

256
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,120
Stay put and keep your mouth shut.

257
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,510
This isn't the time for adventures.

258
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,400
I've weathered more storms
than you've ever sailed through.

259
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,530
Yes, yes, of course.

260
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,930
You've eaten more salt

261
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,870
than I've eaten rice.

262
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,470
From now on, I'm your obedient servant.

263
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,050
What's so funny?

264
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,740
I'll need to

265
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,140
ask for a small favor from you.

266
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,150
Say it.

267
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,510
Have you ever

268
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,550
heard of a gun

269
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,150
called 20-round Mauser?

270
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,970
Fully automatic,

271
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,510
and so much better
than our crappy homemade rifles!

272
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,060
Director Du told me,

273
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,920
the Northern Expedition Army
equips a dozen per company!

274
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,180
That's why the Northern Expedition Army

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,620
dominate every fight!

276
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,600
It's all thanks to those guns!
Father—listen!

277
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
How much does it cost?

278
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,960
It's not expensive.

279
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,750
It costs

280
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,000
less than 10 silver dollars each.

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,270
I've got 20 guys,

282
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,630
You may equip me with 20 guns,
totaling to 200 silver dollars.

283
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,750
You mean, 200 silver dollars?

284
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,480
You mean, 200 silver dollars?

285
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:09,910
Two—Two Hundred?

286
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,200
200 silver dollars!

287
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,240
That gun is awesome.

288
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
200 silver dollars!

289
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,270
How—

290
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,870
How many mu of great farmland
would this cost me?

291
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,960
You just flap your gums

292
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,020
like it's nothing!

293
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,970
Tell me! Do I look like
that 20-round thing to you?

294
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,430
Are you buying for me or not?

295
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,230
I won't buy it.

296
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,420
I don't have money.

297
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,140
What are you doing?

298
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,470
What are you doing?

299
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,490
Did I scare you?

300
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,880
Come in here.

301
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
What's that in your hand?

302
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,460
Nothing at all!

303
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,890
You think I'm blind or something?

304
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,950
I was hungry,

305
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,510
so I grabbed a couple
alkaline steamed buns.

306
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,060
Pork belly stuffed
in refined steamed buns?

307
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,990
You actually have a good appetite!

308
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,090
Look at your waistline...

309
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,840
You've put on inches
after the New Year's celebration!

310
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,640
Don't pretend you don't notice!

311
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,400
How many times must I say it—

312
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,470
eat more alkaline foods!

313
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,270
I know.

314
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,600
Eat alkaline buns

315
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,400
and bear a son for the Fei family.

316
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,330
Fine. I won't eat it, okay?

317
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,470
I won't eat it.

318
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,450
Then take your medicine.

319
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,960
I know it tastes awful,

320
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,170
but I only want what's best for you.

321
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,080
This helps to warm your womb.

322
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,750
It gets your body ready

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,530
so you can conceive easier.

324
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,420
Finish it, and you can choose
lunch today...

325
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,500
plus a bowl of mung bean noodles.

326
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,870
Once you decide on lunch,

327
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,390
just tell the kitchen.

328
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,440
Beard Liu,

329
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,910
prepare more herbs for the Young Mistress.

330
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,570
Same prescription as before.

331
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,670
Five doses...

332
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,920
Actually, make it 10.

333
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,530
How am I supposed to live like this?

334
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,670
What's wrong with me?

335
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,930
I feel dizzy, with blurry vision.
Everything's spinning!

336
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,060
Does it still hurt?

337
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,240
See? It's already scabbed over.

338
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,079
I don't even need bandages.

339
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,270
This arm's never been

340
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,300
treated as precious before!

341
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,310
Back then, a cut here,

342
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,200
a stab there—

343
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,720
I never even noticed!

344
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,160
From now on,

345
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,720
these arms, legs,

346
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,290
hands, and feet of yours

347
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,400
are treasures.

348
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,810
They don't belong just to you anymore.

349
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,000
Then today,

350
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,850
I won't go anywhere—

351
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,440
these arms, legs, and hands

352
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,240
are all yours to keep. Deal?

353
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,240
Don't talk nonsense

354
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,750
What I mean is—
you've got to take care of yourself

355
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,160
before you can
care for our parents and me.

356
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,680
Alright, alright...

357
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,310
No more injuries,

358
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,440
no more worries.

359
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,350
Here—

360
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,170
gently now…

361
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
I've noticed that

362
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,350
this injury of yours

363
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,680
scared Father badly.

364
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,890
Let’s strike while the iron's hot.

365
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,400
I'll find Father later

366
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,300
to get back the land deed.

367
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,810
Why didn't you wait for me?

368
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,150
By the time you showed up,

369
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,150
the crops would've rotted.

370
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,280
Face it—you're half-crippled now.

371
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,810
Can't rely on you for squat.

372
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,350
This little bit of work?

373
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,750
I could do it one-handed!

374
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,830
You go rest—

375
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,630
You're good at nonsense!

376
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,210
One-handed is enough to handle it, huh?

377
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,470
You should be resting!

378
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,710
Why don't you go back?

379
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,920
Why don't you leave?

380
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,720
Look at you—

381
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,950
coming back bleeding.

382
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,200
Go ahead!

383
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,150
One wrong move

384
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,070
and next time it'll be your head!

385
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,880
We're farmers—

386
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,550
our duty is to tend the land.

387
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,880
That's the right thing to do.

388
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,340
Stop chasing pipe dreams!

389
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,680
Are you done yet?

390
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,270
Done.

391
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,920
So what?

392
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,750
if you won't leave, I'll quit nagging.

393
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,440
But take one step,

394
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,230
and I'll keep lecturing!

395
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,100
Father,

396
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,270
I mean it—I'll stay.

397
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,310
I'll work on the 18 mu of land with you.

398
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,470
If you want me to work more,

399
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,960
I'll explore new fields

400
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,510
to make it up to 20 mu,
for you and our family

401
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,270
But you must return Tietou's land.

402
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,090
If you still refuse to return it...

403
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,240
Director Du said,

404
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,880
once I'm healed,

405
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,410
he'll assign me to leave—

406
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,670
taking Xiuxiu with me.

407
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
And who knows

408
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
when we'd return?

409
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,770
Director Du even hinted...

410
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,190
when the movement grows,

411
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,530
he'll send me to the provincial capital.

412
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,880
Maybe even take trains

413
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,140
to the Forbidden City!

414
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,960
Do you think I'll get to see

415
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
the palace where the emperor lives?

416
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,550
Did that pot-bellied director say

417
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,390
you could see the Emperor showing?

418
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,570
Look at you, all grown up!

419
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,760
Why don't you go fly up to heaven?

420
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,020
To heaven, why not?

421
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,160
Go ahead!

422
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,240
Far away!

423
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Out of my sight!

424
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,320
Then I'll leave now, for real.

425
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,830
Enjoy your 30 mu of weeds!

426
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,090
Sister-in-law!

427
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,070
Xiuxiu!

428
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,180
Look! Our land lease papers!

429
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,070
You said you'd get them back for me,

430
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,680
and you really did!

431
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,510
I was wrong about you.

432
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,530
Wait right there—I'm coming over!

433
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,830
Dajiao! Xiu!

434
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,240
Thank you!

435
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,920
I appreciate your help!

436
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,890
That two-faced monkey's got
the nerve to show up?

437
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,280
They may tolerate you, but I won't!

438
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,400
What breaks my heart...

439
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,350
is that land we tilled three times over...

440
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,880
Don't mention it, Auntie!

441
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,310
Tomorrow my mother, Xiuxiu and I

442
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,040
will come plant your peanuts
at Sesame Gully.

443
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,880
We can't wait until Tietou's back.

444
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,090
But I've sent word to Tietou,

445
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,980
urging him to return home faster.

446
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,790
Well...

447
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,350
Xiu.

448
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
I spoke out of turn the other day—

449
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,270
all that nonsense while I was heated.

450
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,120
Don't you dwell on my harsh words please

451
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,650
and don't stoop to my level.

452
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,380
I owe you a proper apology.

453
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,760
Honestly, Auntie...

454
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,720
I've been meaning to tell you too—

455
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,840
I shot my mouth off, same as you.

456
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,720
Hope you aren't holding that
against me either.

457
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,680
Of course not.

458
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,520
Alright then,

459
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,880
you all get back to work.

460
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
I'm heading out now—

461
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,450
See you later, Sister-in-law.

462
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,240
Wendian.

463
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,960
Should've sent word ahead—

464
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,670
we'd have Qing fetch you!

465
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,840
Here, eat!

466
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,830
No no...

467
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,510
She's got her own dishes.

468
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,570
This stays here...

469
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,000
Here.

470
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,290
This bowl's yours...

471
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,830
Here.

472
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,340
And this one's for you...

473
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,400
Here.

474
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,380
This...

475
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,680
You missed
the New Year's celebration at home—

476
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,270
so many dishes you didn't taste...

477
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,800
But I saved everything for you!

478
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,060
We'll have Qing cook it all for you later.

479
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,560
Sister-in-law,

480
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,130
this is too much—I can't finish it alone!

481
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,940
Let's all share it.

482
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,970
This is yours—no sharing!

483
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,000
Not a drop left!

484
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,750
Why?

485
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,420
For your health!

486
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,090
Now,

487
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,480
eat up quickly.

488
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,240
After this,
we've important matters to discuss.

489
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,360
And there's one more dish.

490
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,510
Where's the
Eucommia and Cistanche chicken stew?

491
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,350
Xiaoqin.

492
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,400
Susu.

493
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,590
How’s your sister been doing lately?

494
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,390
Has she got some kind of trouble?

495
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
My sister's fine.

496
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,580
But I've got a big problem now.

497
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,310
What's wrong, Susu?

498
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,760
Listen closely.

499
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,830
The only reason I came back

500
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,070
was a letter from your sister.

501
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,160
I know nothing!

502
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,550
If you want answers,
take it up with your sister-in-law.

503
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,730
My sister-in-law?

504
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,740
Never mind.

505
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,390
I'll go see Xiuxiu in a little while.

506
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,570
Where are you heading?

507
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,070
Sister-in-law,

508
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
I'd like to go for a walk after dinner.

509
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,880
Where you gonna go?
It's pitch black out there!

510
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,610
Whatever it is can wait till tomorrow.

511
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,440
Here—this is yours too.

512
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,480
And this...

513
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,510
Enjoy it.

514
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,110
Susu.

515
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,690
Drink this—

516
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,320
go on, drink!

517
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,640
After dinner, get to bed early.

518
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,680
Wendian's been traveling all day.

519
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,860
He must be exhausted.

520
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,210
Later, get Wendian's footbath ready.

521
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,920
And before sleep...

522
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,350
I know. I know.

523
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,440
Sister-in-law,

524
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,240
didn't you say earlier

525
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,220
there was something important?

526
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,820
What is it?

527
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Well, Susu felt embarrassed.

528
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,930
Sister-in-law, I'm not tired.

529
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,260
I don’t need a footbath!

530
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,420
Who's talking about that footbath?

531
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Wendian, listen.

532
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,830
I'll only ask one thing

533
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,550
from you during this visit.

534
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,920
That is to get Susu pregnant.

535
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,320
Once Susu's carrying your child,

536
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,400
you can roam wherever,

537
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,720
and return whenever.

538
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,680
I won't even lift a finger to stop you.

539
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,270
Sister-in-law,

540
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,870
the whole reason
I came back was to settle this.

541
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,430
this..

542
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,030
Pat her back, quickly!

543
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,770
What's wrong...

544
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,630
Beard Liu, bring a broom here!

545
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,660
What's wrong with you...

546
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,250
What's going on with you?

547
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,080
I've been feeling sick to my stomach...

548
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,310
I don't want to drink
this alkaline porridge.

549
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,160
Oh, Susu.

550
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,200
Sister-in-law, my period
hasn't come for two months now.

551
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,530
I'm afraid I might be...

552
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,790
What?

553
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,410
I'm afraid I might be pregnant.

554
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,670
My period hasn't come
for two months now.

555
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,040
P—Pregnant?

556
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,270
Come on, quickly!

557
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
To bed—immediately!

558
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,790
Why didn't you say so earlier?

559
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,440
I had no clue! You...

560
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,360
You...

561
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,880
How are you feeling now?

562
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,850
Lately I've been dizzy as hell,
nauseous too…

563
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,470
My belly's all hard and swollen...

564
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,270
But you keep saying I'm just overeating!

565
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,440
Saying my clothes shrunk in the wash!

566
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,880
I’m miserable.

567
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,980
Let me feel it...

568
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,160
Let me check.

569
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,070
Oh! It really is firm...

570
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,450
Firm indeed!

571
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,110
Then... most likely you're with child!

572
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, Susu...

573
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,450
I'm so sorry, I had no idea...

574
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,740
Hush now, no more tears... no more tears.

575
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,550
This is wonderful news, Wendian!

576
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,090
That's impossible...

577
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,110
Why not?

578
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,490
I'll let you know
if it's possible in a bit.

579
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,030
Susu!

580
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,570
You stay in bed now—don't get up!

581
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,590
I'll be back soon!

582
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,830
Beard Liu!

583
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,240
Madam, I'm here.

584
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,270
Stop sweeping! Forget the sweeping!

585
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,680
Prepare the cart
and fetch the doctor! Now!

586
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,960
Keep quiet!

587
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,640
Faster!

588
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,620
Hurry up.

589
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,110
Move it!

590
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,090
Get out of my way.

591
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,460
Second Boss.

592
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,940
The clothes and bedding are all silk—

593
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,960
I took everything.

594
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,690
But I couldn't find any silver.

595
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,400
Take all the farmhands outside—now!

596
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,550
Up! Move!

597
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
Faster, faster—

598
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,180
Move!

599
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,660
Move it!

600
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,010
Don't move a muscle. Stay put.

601
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,720
Standard rules.

602
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,790
Who scouted this place?

603
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,430
Step forward. Interrogate them yourself.

604
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,400
Spare me...

605
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,780
You think I don't know

606
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,850
whether your family has money?

607
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,510
Feng Si!

608
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,410
You landlords—

609
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,730
all slick talkers and sweet lies!

610
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,310
Cheating, stealing, scheming in shadows—

611
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,960
while we farmers

612
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,440
watch our ancestors' last coins

613
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,640
slip into your vaults!

614
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,420
Your fields devour ours,

615
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,400
gnawing our bones dry—

616
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,030
not even spitting out the marrow!

617
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,550
Everyone!

618
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,860
Shall I paint you a white gourd

619
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,690
or a red gourd?

620
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,430
I want red!

621
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,580
-White gourd.
-Red.

622
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,130
I'll count to three.

623
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,000
If red comes out—it's red.

624
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,770
If white comes out—then enjoy the white.

625
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,790
One.

626
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,680
Two.

627
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,070
Take it! Take it all!

628
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,200
Just give them the money—now!

629
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,100
Damn, he ran fast...

630
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,440
Just some worthless hired hand.

631
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,640
Whatever. Let him go.

632
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,390
Alright, let's head back.

633
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,450
Alright. Let's go.

634
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,310
This pulse…

635
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,480
It's chaotic.

636
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,640
Chaos?

637
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,880
Is it pregnancy?

638
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,460
A pregnancy pulse?

639
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,130
It resembles that.

640
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,880
It resembles a pregnancy pulse.

641
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,790
Resembles?

642
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,550
It is!

643
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,920
It is a pregnancy pulse.

644
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,930
A pregnancy pulse.

645
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,550
That's true.

646
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,880
It's a pregnancy pulse.

647
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,790
Wendian.

648
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,170
I feel sick.

649
00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:59,770
Get the basin!

650
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,970
Here. Here you go.

651
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,420
Here—let it out!

652
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,680
Qing.

653
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,270
Madam.

654
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,070
The Young Mistress is pregnant!

655
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,590
At first light tomorrow,
go to the Ning's Residence

656
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,510
with the news.

657
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,440
And send word
to her elder sister's family as well.

658
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,720
Yes, understood, Madam.

659
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,440
Doctor Huo.

660
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,940
Write the prescription.

661
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,690
List everything
that she should eat or drink!

662
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,350
Certainly.

663
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,400
My poor Susu.

664
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,440
You've endured such hardship...

665
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,480
Miss Xiuxiu.

666
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,000
Miss Xiuxiu.

667
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,620
Miss Xiuxiu.

668
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,790
Dajiao.

669
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,680
Qing.

670
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,760
Miss Xiuxiu.

671
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,440
Mrs. Fei

672
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,210
asked me to bring you a message,

673
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,140
our Young Mistress is pregnant!

674
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,000
That's wonderful!

675
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,410
Susu's pregnancy is such blessed news!

676
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,170
The Fei family lineage
will now flourish and grow.

677
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,000
Since the younger sister conceives first,

678
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
you, the elder sister,
surely won't be far behind?

679
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,720
Mother!

680
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,080
Alright then, I'll be going now.

681
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,460
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

682
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,460
Mother, I should go check on Susu.

683
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,300
Go, go see her.

684
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,930
Let me change clothes first.

685
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,310
Mother...

686
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,000
Shall we

687
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,400
have Xiuxiu bring those eggs to Susu?

688
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,350
Great minds think alike!

689
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,880
Come on, let's get the eggs.

690
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,270
Susu!

691
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,040
Come on here, quickly.

692
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,000
Susu, your sister's here to see you!

693
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,680
Susu.

694
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,230
Xiuxiu.

695
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,510
I brought you eggs—get your strength up.

696
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,050
How are you feeling now?

697
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,510
Xiuxiu!

698
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,160
Be careful.

699
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,830
Xiuxiu.

700
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
I feel so sick...

701
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,880
Why am I so nauseous?

702
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,640
This is all my fault.

703
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,070
Susu has missed two monthly cycles,

704
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,600
but I didn't even notice it.

705
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,920
But Xiuxiu, listen—

706
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,550
I swear

707
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,480
I'll care for her properly now.

708
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,240
Right now, she enjoys
the same level of care as our ancestors.

709
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,170
We might as well build her a shrine!

710
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,700
Xiuxiu,

711
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,340
keep watch on her.

712
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,070
Don't let her feet touch the ground!

713
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,000
First trimester's
the most critical period.

714
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,390
Ah! She barely ate during lunch.

715
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,120
I'll get her something for her.

716
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,270
You girls talk.

717
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,930
I can't swallow anything down right now...

718
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,860
You're not just yourself anymore.

719
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,890
You need proper rest and care.

720
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,850
That body carries two souls now,

721
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,080
no more reckless running about!

722
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,750
Our little Susu...

723
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,890
soon to be a mother...

724
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,960
If only our mother were here,

725
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,500
she'd be wild with joy.

726
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,720
Xiuxiu.

727
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,150
Is this...

728
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,500
really something to be so happy about?

729
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,960
Of course it is! You silly girl!

730
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,480
Listen, Su—

731
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,070
you rest well now.

732
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,710
Once the sickness passes,

733
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,430
I'll take you to my house.

734
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,040
I'll care for you proper.

735
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,780
Here, lie down.

736
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,660
I don't want to.

737
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,110
It suffers... right here...

738
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,510
Don't press it randomly.

739
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,580
Xiuxiu,

740
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,150
Wendian's return...

741
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,890
we owe it all to your letter.

742
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,030
I owe you deep gratitude.

743
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,680
Sister-in-law,

744
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,350
We still haven't thanked you properly

745
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,630
for helping with
Tietou's land dispute last time...

746
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,590
I keep my promises.

747
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,240
Qing.

748
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,680
Prepare the cart to send Xiuxiu home.

749
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,590
No need, I can walk...

750
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,200
Xiuxiu.

751
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,310
Wendian,

752
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,060
Since you're here,
escort Xiuxiu out properly.

753
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,540
I'll go check on Susu.

754
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,300
Xiuxiu.

755
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,790
Wendian,

756
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,200
I haven't gotten a chance
to congratulate you yet.

757
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,930
You're going to be a father now.

758
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,680
Susu's carrying your child.

759
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,350
I hope...

760
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,100
you'll treat her well from now on.

761
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,680
While you were gone...

762
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,480
Susu had it...

763
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,150
pretty rough.

764
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,880
She told me more than once

765
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,130
she couldn't bear the Fei family anymore.

766
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,159
I kept thinking—she's so young,

767
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,510
so unsure of herself...

768
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,380
so I urged her

769
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,280
to try harder with you.

770
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,690
So, this time...

771
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
don't leave so soon.

772
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,100
Susu's still a child at heart,

773
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,510
but her love's fierce,

774
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,429
and her intentions pure.

775
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,550
Wendian,

776
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,960
promise me this:

777
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
be good to Susu.

778
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,120
I'll go now...

779
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,360
but I'll visit Susu again soon.

780
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,440
Father...

781
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,500
I—I know I messed up...

782
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,180
Let go.

783
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,050
Father...

784
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,240
just let me keep this one bird?

785
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,920
I need... something to remember it by.

786
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,450
Take it.

787
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,600
Stew it with liquor.

788
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,550
But you don't have to—

789
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,320
Take it.

790
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,230
Fine. Fine.

791
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,440
Just this one, Father...
Let me keep it, please... for memories...

792
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,000
Get out.

793
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,150
Second Uncle.

794
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,860
Kejin.

795
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,440
How did it go?

796
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,190
That brat is finished!

797
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,070
They refuse to settle.

798
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,840
They say he's their only son,

799
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,880
not even married yet,

800
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,610
and now his leg's been broken by him!

801
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,320
Now they're taking it to court.

802
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,120
They want him rotting in prison!

803
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,550
Father! I know I was wrong!

804
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,030
Father, I can't go to prison!

805
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,760
Father, before Mother died,
you promised her

806
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,960
you'd get me a wife and kids—

807
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,610
to carry on the Ning family line!

808
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,850
You wretch!

809
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,110
Father.

810
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,930
When you were beating that man
half to death,

811
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,730
where was your conscience then?

812
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,210
Li.

813
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,360
Master.

814
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,710
Drag this wretched boy

815
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,260
to kneel
before his mother's memorial tablet!

816
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,050
Now!

817
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,280
Please come along, Young Master...

818
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Don't inflame your father further.

819
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,660
Kejin.

820
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,510
is there any room for negotiation?

821
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,510
Useless as this fool is,

822
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,280
I must keep him from the gallows.

823
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,960
We can't let him rot in prison!

824
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,620
I'll try calling in favors...

825
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,390
See if any connections can intervene.

826
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,110
But Second Uncle—

827
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,640
you'd better prepare some silver.

828
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:58,970
Father.

829
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,230
You're back!

830
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,440
We were just about to bring you your meal!

831
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,760
No, no—

832
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,240
hold on!

833
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,960
Great news!

834
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,770
Great news!

835
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,110
What news?

836
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,420
The heavens shut a door on me…

837
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,990
But opened a window!

838
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,710
We can forget about Tietou's land.

839
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,000
Now, we can buy your Second Uncle's plot!

840
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,710
He's desperate for help now.

841
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,120
That no-good cousin of yours
got into trouble!

842
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,360
What? Kebi's in trouble?

843
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,540
Wasn't he obsessed with those…

844
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,000
quail fights?

845
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,930
That's right!

846
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,490
Then Song family's boy from the town

847
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,340
had a quail

848
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,030
that pecked his bird's eye out!

849
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,440
Your cousin lost his temper,
beat the kid up—

850
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,630
and broke his bones!

851
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,110
Luckily, your brother stepped in,

852
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,240
and they barely agreed to
settle for 500 silver dollars!

853
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,800
Father,

854
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,190
I'll go assess the situation.

855
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,120
I'll go with you.

856
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,510
Wait—

857
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,600
hold up! hold up!

858
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,200
Are you planning to buy land?

859
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,700
You even got the money?

860
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,190
Listen up, everyone!

861
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,480
If you can actually help,

862
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,800
talk to my second uncle inside later.

863
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,010
If you can't?

864
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,840
Quit loitering around

865
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,040
and go back now!

866
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,400
What a mess!

867
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,110
So much money.

868
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,320
-Where to gather that much?
-Exactly.

869
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,110
Xiu's here!

870
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,760
Xiuxiu is here. Go inside.

871
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,360
Make way—Xiuxiu's here!

872
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
His niece is here!

873
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,620
Xiuxiu has arrived.

874
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,880
Kejin, what's the situation now?

875
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,210
You two got the news too?

876
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,090
Go check on Second Uncle, quick!

877
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,550
Xiu, you go in there first.

878
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,720
Where is Kebi?

879
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,750
He's locked in the woodshed.

880
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,140
That little brat's had it too easy.

881
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,940
Let him starve for a few days

882
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,490
Dajiao and I came
as soon as we heard about it.

883
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,090
What can I do to help?

884
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,990
Just you being here to talk with me

885
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,030
already puts my heart at ease.

886
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,030
Everything has been handled by Kejin.

887
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,410
I could never measure up to your father.

888
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,940
He raised fine children...

889
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,680
Second Uncle,

890
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,490
You'd rather sell your land
to save your son—

891
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,860
gave up everything

892
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,770
to keep Kebi out of prison.

893
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,840
That's what a real father does.

894
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,230
Him? He's not fit to stand in your shadow.

895
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,650
Xiuxiu...

896
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,640
About what happened to you—

897
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,000
I failed to help.

898
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,590
That regret still cuts deep.

899
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,870
The land agent is here.

900
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,660
Uncle, why'd you come back alone?

901
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,990
Where are the buyers and Mrs. Fei?

902
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,030
I came ahead.

903
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,060
Mrs. Fei said she'd follow shortly.

904
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,610
My in-laws!

905
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,510
My in-laws!

906
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,000
Father,

907
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,650
what are you doing here?

908
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,010
I came here to help.

909
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,500
Help with what? Let's not get involved.

910
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:21,880
Go home!

911
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,190
Stay aside.

912
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,960
What do you even know!

913
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Stay out of my way.

914
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,480
My in-law!

915
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,840
Cousin brother.

916
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,030
My in-law!

917
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,360
Father.

918
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,710
You...

919
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,220
I heard about the family trouble.

920
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,630
No other intention—

921
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,400
here's 40 silver dollars. 40.

922
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,610
Just take it to settle the trouble.

923
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,550
The child is what matters most.

924
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,450
Feng Er,

925
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,590
Your kindness

926
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,690
Your kindness leaves me
at a complete loss.

927
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,350
Feng Er, please take a seat.

928
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,190
Sit down, please.

929
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,920
Come on here.

930
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,350
Xiuxiu, pour your father-in-law
some tea—quickly!

931
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,280
Father.

932
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,480
Thank you!

933
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,550
We're family—

934
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,230
no need for such formalities!

935
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,530
Feng Er.

936
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,390
I know this money—

937
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,520
for folks like us who work the land—

938
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
comes from skipping meals,
patching clothes,

939
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,980
coin by hard-earned coin.

940
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,980
Yes, that's true.

941
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,760
Your willingness to help

942
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,400
touches me deeply,

943
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,190
but I can't in good conscience
take your hard-earned silver.

944
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,850
Let's pick the land properly—

945
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,940
no one ever feared too many fields.

946
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,560
Even between kin,

947
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,940
accounts must stay clear.

948
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,510
Feng Er,

949
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
please have a look at the land later.

950
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,710
No—No rush.

951
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,880
Settling the trouble is more important.

952
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,090
Village Chief!

953
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,920
Village Chief!

954
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,590
I'm here to help too.

955
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,720
I've come here to offer my help as well.

956
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,440
We can help!

957
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,230
We can help.

958
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,440
Thanks everyone for coming to help.

959
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,030
Let's go and talk outside.

960
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,560
Alright.

961
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,960
We have money here.

962
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,800
I know you all come with money.

963
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,510
I want to thank everyone
on behalf of my uncle.

964
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,440
We do have land available.

965
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,970
Prime plots included—
guaranteed you'll get yours.

966
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,960
Please take a break first, okay?

967
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,070
Okay then, I'll be waiting.

968
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,070
Great.

969
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,320
Just a moment, please.

970
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,520
Then we'll wait here.

971
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,480
I'll be waiting right here.

972
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,030
Dajiao,

973
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,720
I gotta get home for a bite—

974
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,520
I'm starving.

975
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,280
If anything comes up here,
just send someone to call me back here.

976
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,880
All right!

977
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,620
Kejin.

978
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,810
Does Ning Xuexiang know about this?

979
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,850
What did he say?

980
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,610
Will he help?

981
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,880
Father hasn't been home these days.

982
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,810
He went to the provincial capital
to visit Uncle Pan.

983
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,570
I'll grab a bite at home.

984
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,000
Is Father here to buy the land?

985
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,320
Our father—

986
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,520
he knew exactly Second Uncle's soft spot.

987
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,710
Called it helping in need,

988
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,770
but we all know he came for the fields.

989
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,130
Even played the saint while at it.

990
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,530
Now with the good plots almost gone,

991
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,210
he can't keep up the act.

992
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,400
I'm gonna find Susu.

993
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,250
I’ll go with you—

994
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,720
got something to tell you on the way.

995
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,190
Okay.
