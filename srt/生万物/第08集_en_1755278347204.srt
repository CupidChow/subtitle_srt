00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,680
Mother!

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Dajiao.

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,930
I figured you'd be back soon.

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,310
Come on, dinner's ready.

7
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,950
Coming, I'm starving.

8
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,590
Honey.

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,150
Dinner's ready.

10
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,410
Let's dig in, Father. Stop calculating.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,860
What happened?

12
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,560
Why is there ash on your face?

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Is there more?

14
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,830
We're farmers—
getting a little dirty is normal.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,720
Xiuxiu tended the fire for today's meal.

16
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,650
It burned

17
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,870
so well!

18
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,770
Did I use too much firewood?

19
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,800
No, it was fine.

20
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,700
Dig in.

21
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,270
Sit down.

22
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:21,730
Here.

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,710
Get a bun for Xiuxiu.

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,370
Take it.

25
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,630
Father,

26
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,170
Mother,

27
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,329
the porridge alone is enough for me.

28
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,190
I heard that.

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Your father-in-law heard it too.

30
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,620
Our daughter-in-law is so considerate!

31
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,590
Just look.

32
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,270
She enjoys the wild vegetable porridge
so much.

33
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,280
She doesn't seem like
a girl from a wealthy family.

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,190
I'm not from a wealthy family.

35
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,510
I am

36
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,940
one of you.

37
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,580
We're family.

38
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,100
Have some more.

39
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,829
Eat up.

40
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,480
Eat up.

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,750
Hoeing the field?

42
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,430
Master,

43
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,560
out scooping manure again?

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,960
Master.

45
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,920
A rich man's daughter
working in the fields—

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,270
what a rare sight.

47
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,560
Indeed.

48
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,120
Xiuxiu must have made up her mind

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,180
to stay with Dajiao

50
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,870
and endure a hard life now.

51
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,920
Times have changed.

52
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,090
The Ning ancestors

53
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,570
really ought to open their eyes
and see this.

54
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,870
Don't work too hard and tire yourself.

55
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,470
It's fine.

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,820
Master.

57
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,210
Master Ning.

58
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,370
You could have lived a good life,

59
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,130
but you chose to suffer
and work in the fields,

60
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,190
bringing shame to the Ning ancestors.

61
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,480
Feng Er!

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,830
Feng Er!

63
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,160
Come here!

64
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,800
Don't mind him.

65
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,060
It's fine, I'll check it out.

66
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,600
Hey there, in-law.

67
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,760
Look.

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,310
Since our children got married,

69
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,240
we haven't had a proper chat.

70
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,710
They say you're a petty schemer,

71
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,190
and now I see it for myself.

72
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,270
My daughter was pampered at home.

73
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,450
I'd be worried about her wrist
from merely striking a match.

74
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,750
Yet here you are,
making her toil in the fields.

75
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,750
Do you take her as a draft animal now?

76
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,030
You feel wronged?

77
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,560
If anyone should feel scorned,

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
it's me—

79
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,070
not you, standing here
acting all high and mighty.

80
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,690
Why are you standing here
instead of working?

81
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,420
Keep it down.

82
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,390
Listen, you bug-eyed fool.

83
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,030
Ask your conscience.

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,560
Think back

85
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,550
to when your family was in trouble—
who helped you?

86
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,450
Your daughter was in such a state,

87
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,540
yet we still took her in.

88
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,820
My son married her.

89
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
If it weren't for my son,

90
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,610
your daughter wouldn't have found
a husband.

91
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,620
Stop talking nonsense.

92
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,890
My daughter

93
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,680
was cherished by us since she was a child.

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,640
She never left the house.

95
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,070
Also, we didn't take a penny
of bride price,

96
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,560
and there was no proper matchmaking.

97
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,620
Your son, a mere farmer,
got himself quite the bargain.

98
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,720
Your ancestors must have done good deeds.

99
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,520
Instead of keeping her well-provided for
at home,

100
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,680
you're making her work in the fields
with you.

101
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,430
How can you be so heartless?

102
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,720
I...

103
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,840
Ning Xuexiang really does care about
his daughter.

104
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,990
Where was he before?

105
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,270
He didn't say anything
when it was time to rescue his daughter,

106
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,830
but now he's bringing it up.

107
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,310
Listen, you bug-eyed fool.

108
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,409
What's wrong? Am I not telling the truth?

109
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:56,700
So now she's your precious daughter?

110
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,940
When she got into danger,

111
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,800
what did you do to help as her father?

112
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,930
My son brought a proper wedding sedan.

113
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,450
It was a legitimate marriage.

114
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,230
Better not mention the bride price—

115
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,590
that really makes me angry.

116
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,680
What bride price did you give our family?

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
Did you give anything?

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Most tightwads just won't spend,

119
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,310
but you're a sticky-fingered one.

120
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,170
Not only won't you give,
you're even trying to take.

121
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,190
I did give something.

122
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,190
As dowry,

123
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,950
I gave the best 15 mu of land by the well.

124
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't mention those 15 mu of land—

125
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,020
that makes me even angrier.

126
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,680
You think those 15 mu of land

127
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,750
are enough to marry off your daughter?

128
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,240
Did you think you were throwing trash away

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,890
when you married off your daughter?

130
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,350
-Xiuxiu said...
-Dajiao.

131
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,460
she doesn't care about
those 15 mu of land,

132
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,780
and neither do I!

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,490
Father!

134
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,450
My daughter-in-law was calling for me.

135
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't waste time with people
who don't matter.

136
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,659
Father,

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,330
help me load the manure.

138
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,250
Coming.

139
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,270
Fill it up more.

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,160
Go get some rest.

141
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
No need, Dajiao.

142
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,830
I'm now the wife of a farmer.

143
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,110
From now on, I'll be living a life
of toiling in the land.

144
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,120
I need to work in the fields.

145
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,730
I know my place.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,190
I'm no longer a rich young lady.

147
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,920
Ever since I

148
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,990
was abandoned at the bandits' lair
with no one to care for me,

149
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,230
I stopped being one.

150
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,410
Don't you know what's good for you?

151
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,870
I care about you,
and I'm speaking up for you.

152
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,070
If you go on like this,

153
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,929
you'll spend your whole life

154
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,809
being ordered around by your in-laws.

155
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,159
Let me do it.

156
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,539
Thank you so much.

157
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,260
But this is my fate,

158
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,300
the one you chose for me.

159
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,740
Spare me the crocodile tears.

160
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,430
What an ungrateful girl.

161
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,090
Ungrateful!

162
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,460
I fed you, raised you,

163
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
and gave you everything.

164
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,980
But now you're here to rip my heart out.

165
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,170
Be careful.

166
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,300
Don't fall and get yourself paralyzed.

167
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,760
You're breaking my heart.

168
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,940
Let's go. Don't look anymore.

169
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,110
So ungrateful.

170
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,910
Such an ingrate.

171
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,200
Today, your wife

172
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,720
really made me proud.

173
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,640
Look at you, Father.

174
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,570
What did you gain by jumping in like that?

175
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,670
That's right.

176
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,920
It felt good to speak up,

177
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,510
but those 15 mu of land

178
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,200
are gone now.

179
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,920
They're all gone...

180
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,480
I told you not to carry it,
but you insisted.

181
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,520
I'll heat up the plaster—

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
apply it quickly.

183
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,550
Here.

184
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,840
Can you put it on yourself?

185
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,720
Need my help?

186
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
I'll try.

187
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,580
Look.

188
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,780
It's swollen.

189
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,900
Take this egg.

190
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,700
Roll it like this,

191
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,430
and it'll help reduce
the bruising and swelling.

192
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,710
You've not been very thoughtful.

193
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,200
Someone who's never carried a load
wouldn't understand how it feels.

194
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,790
Dajiao,

195
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,520
come here.

196
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,450
I've got water boiling on the stove.
You handle this.

197
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,410
Come here.

198
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,120
I'll go check on the water for you.

199
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Help your wife roll it,

200
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,840
just like this.

201
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,650
Here,

202
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,930
roll it over the swelling so it goes down.

203
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,290
Thank you, Mother.

204
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,560
Dajiao,

205
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,640
move.

206
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,660
I-I mean, you can move

207
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,840
the egg across my shoulder.

208
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,860
I-It doesn't hurt.

209
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,080
That's because

210
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,670
it's too swollen.

211
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,670
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

212
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,120
Go ahead.

213
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,360
I want you to help me

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,080
find a tank

215
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,360
and heat some water.

216
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,200
I want to take a bath.

217
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,730
I've been here for days,

218
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,160
only able to wipe myself.

219
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,600
Now I feel uncomfortable all over.

220
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,320
How big should the tank be?

221
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,870
Just big enough to fit me.

222
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,200
Alright.

223
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,560
I'll go find one.

224
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,280
Put that plaster on.

225
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,830
Okay, here you go.

226
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,360
I-I'll step outside.

227
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,240
Oh, right.

228
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,670
Here's some soap.

229
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,300
Why did she have to bathe

230
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,200
in this water tank?

231
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,870
Come here and smell this.

232
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,510
Come here.

233
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,460
Smell this.

234
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,170
It all smells like soap.

235
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,600
How can we possibly use it
for food or drink?

236
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,210
This rich young lady

237
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,790
is so damn fussy.

238
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,120
Keep your voice down.

239
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,740
Can't we just wash it and use it again?

240
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,920
Go fetch some water.
I need to prepare the meal.

241
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,700
What do you mean
by "wash it and use it again"?

242
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,820
Smell it.

243
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,740
This soap smell.

244
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,380
Doesn't it make you sick?

245
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,120
Do you even have an appetite now?

246
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,720
It's over.

247
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,150
The tank's ruined now.

248
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,030
Ruined!

249
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,840
Even if the water tank is ruined,
we can still boil water

250
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
and cook meals to fill our stomachs.

251
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,100
What a disaster!

252
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,390
Father.

253
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,990
I-I was wrong.

254
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,550
I didn't know
this was the only water tank in the house.

255
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,750
What else do you know?

256
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,560
You think this is your parents' home?

257
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,960
Big tanks holding medium tanks,

258
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,220
medium tanks holding small tanks—
every kind of tank!

259
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,130
Our family has only this one tank!

260
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,080
Smell it. Can we still cook with this?

261
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,680
Can we even drink this water?

262
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,650
Good grief! If word gets out

263
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,510
that my daughter-in-law was bathing in it,

264
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,870
aren't you embarrassed?

265
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,970
Since you married into our family, right?

266
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,830
You have to live our way,

267
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,950
eat our food,

268
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,030
and speak in a way we can understand.

269
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,200
Xiuxiu, don't listen to his nonsense.

270
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,660
I'm already used to it.

271
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,790
When he starts rambling,

272
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,180
I just listen to the birds
singing in the trees.

273
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,260
Come on, let's go back inside.

274
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,970
Father, I was wrong.

275
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,840
From now on, for anything in the house,

276
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,900
I'll ask you first.

277
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,360
Why didn't you do that earlier?

278
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
What are you doing standing outside?

279
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,250
Don't you feel cold?

280
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,870
Dajiao,

281
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,200
why didn't you tell me

282
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,600
this was the only tank in the house?

283
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
What's wrong?

284
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,590
I went to fetch water

285
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,320
just to clean this tank, right?

286
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,700
When I'm done, it'll be cleaner than ever.

287
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,030
Use it if you want.

288
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,420
I won't be using it.

289
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,550
Just smelling that scented soap

290
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,200
makes me feel faint.

291
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,620
Wait. What's the matter, Father?

292
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,960
Is this really such a big deal?

293
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Don't worry.

294
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,240
Starting tomorrow,

295
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,550
I'll get up early
and fill all these water buckets

296
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,630
for you.

297
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,550
You can use whichever one you like.

298
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,280
They'll all be filled
with crystal-clear water.

299
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,320
Xiuxiu,

300
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,650
don't mind him.

301
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,310
That cooking pot in the kitchen?

302
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,030
I've even boiled pig feed in it

303
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,860
and dyed cloth blue.

304
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,640
And now you're complaining?

305
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,090
I think you're the one being unreasonable.

306
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,250
Feeling disgusted?

307
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,360
I bet the soles of Xiuxiu's feet

308
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,110
are cleaner than your face.

309
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,570
Mother.

310
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,440
Today, I call the shots.

311
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,480
Dajiao, fill up all those water buckets.

312
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,960
I'll cook later.

313
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,780
Seriously.

314
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,600
It's fine.

315
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,560
Go inside quickly. I'll fetch the water.

316
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,770
I'll go with you.

317
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Your shoulder...

318
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,870
Alright, as you wish.

319
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,810
Let's go.

320
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,030
Dajiao,

321
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,790
I'm new to your family.

322
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,670
There's so much I don't understand yet.

323
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,790
You can't just let me be.
You have to teach me.

324
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,200
With Father and Mother around,

325
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,370
we should live the way you used to.

326
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,510
Set examples for me and I'll learn.

327
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,570
I'm just worried about you...

328
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,030
I'm not afraid of hardship,

329
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,630
and I don't feel mistreated.

330
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,720
Let me carry the water today.

331
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,490
Your shoulders haven't healed yet.

332
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,210
Didn't you say once calluses form,
it won't hurt anymore?

333
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,570
I can do it. I'm ready.

334
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,400
Take it slow.

335
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,800
Yes, keep it more centered.

336
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,240
Is this right?

337
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,330
Xiu's really sensible.
She knows how to run a household.

338
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,030
Dajiao's really hard on his wife,
letting her carry all the water herself.

339
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,510
Indeed.

340
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,390
Can you manage?

341
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:23,990
Yes, I can.

342
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,590
That poor man Feng Er.

343
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,740
He's becoming more and more unreliable.

344
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,890
He doesn't even treat your sister
like a human being—

345
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,440
making her carry manure,
fetch water, chop wood...

346
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,790
all these heavy chores.

347
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,310
When has my daughter

348
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,050
ever endured such hardship?

349
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,390
Who told you all this?

350
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,480
Everyone in the village
is talking about it.

351
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
When I went out today,

352
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,140
I even saw Xiuxiu following Dajiao
to chop wood.

353
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,440
What?

354
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,930
Today is Minor Cold,
which can be worse than Major Cold.

355
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,860
Dajiao took my sister to chop wood?

356
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,589
Didn't you tell me

357
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,550
that Dajiao treats your sister well?

358
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,480
Now it looks like

359
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,380
it was all a lie.

360
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,880
I've been thinking.

361
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,960
During your mother's funeral,

362
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,589
Dajiao came.

363
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,560
I didn't even consider him
as a son-in-law.

364
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,050
So now, the Feng family

365
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,750
is forcing your sister
to work like a slave.

366
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,490
Father.

367
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,670
What do you suggest we do?

368
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,240
How about

369
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
we give

370
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,750
those 15 mu of land to the Feng family?

371
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,400
This way, I think

372
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,380
they'll at least treat Xiuxiu better.

373
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,380
What do you think?

374
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,700
I've told you so much.

375
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,280
And this is your only solution?

376
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,790
Can you use your brain?

377
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,590
That poor man Feng Er.

378
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,920
Does he even have a shred of humanity?

379
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,400
Today he wants 15 mu.

380
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,830
Tomorrow he'll want 50 mu,

381
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,370
and the day after, he'll dare ask for 500!

382
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,720
How much land do we have?

383
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,120
Can we satisfy his greed?

384
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,160
Even if I give in once or twice,

385
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,320
eventually I'll have to stop.

386
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,850
Won't that make your sister suffer
even more?

387
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,530
How can you think like that?

388
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,920
I'll go check it out.

389
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,010
Brother.

390
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Why are you here?

391
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,180
It's Minor Cold today.

392
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,420
Why did you go to chop wood?

393
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,930
Brother,

394
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,330
let's go inside.

395
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,440
Careful.

396
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,820
Come on.

397
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,580
Don't drop it.

398
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:28,960
It's fine.

399
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,620
Be careful.

400
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,510
Put it here.

401
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,640
Don't scatter the wood.

402
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,150
Be careful.

403
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,590
Come on in and have a seat.

404
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,110
No need.

405
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Looks like my sister
has really suffered here.

406
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,110
Mr. Ning is here.

407
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,640
Have a seat.

408
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,640
Isn't there an old saying?

409
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,240
Wed to a cock, walk his walk;
wed to a cur, no demur;

410
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,040
wed to a bear, go where it'd fare.

411
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,720
Ever since your sister married into
our farming family,

412
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,960
she's become one of us.

413
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,590
Right? Besides,

414
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,790
she doesn't even acknowledge
your father anymore,

415
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,990
nor does she want to return to your home.

416
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,590
So what if she has to endure

417
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,000
a little hardship

418
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,840
here with us?

419
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,170
Mr. Ning,

420
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,600
we know that

421
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,550
Minor Cold is the coldest period.

422
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,050
It's bitterly cold,

423
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,240
and that's when we go to chop firewood.

424
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,680
Xiuxiu is a good daughter-in-law.

425
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,830
She insisted on going,

426
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,240
wanting to help ease her husband's burden.

427
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,490
Brother,

428
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,620
my parents-in-law are right.

429
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,310
We're family now.

430
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,460
Helping out around the house

431
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,520
is what I should do.

432
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,000
Before,

433
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,310
with you and Mother looking after me,

434
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,680
I had a good life.

435
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,680
Now,

436
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,030
I'm in Dajiao's home,

437
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,140
and I'm quite content.

438
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,920
My parents-in-law take good care of me.

439
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,470
I'm neither hungry nor cold,

440
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,330
so don't worry.

441
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,000
Xiu.

442
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
I care about you.

443
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,640
On my way here, I was thinking—

444
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,680
when you were little, you used to say

445
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,740
people need something to strive for,

446
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,190
something to aim for.

447
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,130
But what are you striving for now?

448
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,640
Brother.

449
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,310
This winter,

450
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,180
if my in-laws hadn't taken me in,

451
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,620
I wouldn't have survived.

452
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,530
I've thought about it too.

453
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,550
Living a good life

454
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,560
is the main thing
that keeps me going right now.

455
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,400
If I can't even survive,

456
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,370
what's the point of having ambitions?

457
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,030
I'll build my own happy life.

458
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,850
It will surely get better day by day.

459
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,790
Dajiao.

460
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,730
You've married a good woman.

461
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,610
Treat my sister well!

462
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,970
Brother.

463
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,880
Don't worry.

464
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,110
From now on,

465
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,860
I will never let Xiuxiu get tired,

466
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,940
nor will I let her suffer any grievances.

467
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,650
Are you leaving?

468
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,590
Uncle, Auntie.

469
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,660
I'll have someone bring more firewood.

470
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,010
Thank you, brother.

471
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,730
I need to say something.

472
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,110
Listen, Xiuxiu,

473
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,830
when you were talking to
your brother today,

474
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,550
you said something that wasn't right.

475
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,110
Which part?

476
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
You said,

477
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,340
if we hadn't taken you in,

478
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,120
you wouldn't survive this harsh winter.

479
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,970
What do you mean "taken in"?

480
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,310
You were properly married to Dajiao

481
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,860
with a traditional wedding ceremony.

482
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,210
You're part of our family now.

483
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,400
Also,

484
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,500
starting tomorrow,

485
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,790
all the heavy work

486
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,330
and all the tiring and dirty chores,

487
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,930
you won't be doing any of those.

488
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,460
Dajiao and I will handle it.

489
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,440
I'm not tired.

490
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,790
I can do it.

491
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,550
Just do as I say!

492
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,030
You and your mother

493
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,830
just do the light work.

494
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,670
We men will do the heavy work.

495
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,640
Can't you drink like you used to?

496
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,550
Who can stand
your current way of drinking?

497
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,310
I'm afraid you'll choke.

498
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,430
If something happens to you

499
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,200
and you pass out,

500
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,440
I can't afford to pay for your treatment.

501
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
It'd be the death of me.

502
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Won't it just be a waste of food?

503
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,000
You're still awake, Mother?

504
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,810
Stop chopping wood.

505
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,070
Why don't you do something useful?

506
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,670
What do you mean by "useful"?

507
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,110
Your wife's period is over.

508
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,830
I almost forgot to tell you.

509
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,590
Get moving!

510
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,530
Why are you telling me this?

511
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,900
Your father and I want grandchildren.

512
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,680
You're running away again!

513
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,070
All you know is running away from home!

514
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,920
You leave us three at home.

515
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,440
How are we supposed to get food?

516
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,110
Do you think we can survive on air?

517
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,660
Stop yelling!
I'm just going out to lay low for a while.

518
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,400
Didn't I tell you to go back to
your parents' place?

519
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,600
It's New Year's time.

520
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,610
There's nothing left at home.

521
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,330
You want me to

522
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,640
go back to my parents' empty-handed?

523
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,020
Do you have no shame?

524
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,400
You've got nothing to eat.
What's the point of worrying about face?

525
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,780
-What are you doing?
-Father!

526
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,370
You wretch! Go ahead and run!

527
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:13,750
Father!

528
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,150
I'll take the children to drown ourselves!

529
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,070
What's wrong with Feng Si?

530
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,720
Feng Si.

531
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,000
Feng Si.

532
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,530
Thinking of running away?

533
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,530
No, no, I'm not running away.

534
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,020
The monk may escape,
but the temple remains.

535
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,670
Yes.

536
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,750
I doubt you have what it takes anyway.

537
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,600
Kuangzi, give me the abacus.

538
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,340
Four years and eleven months.

539
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,920
The principal plus interest comes to…

540
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,880
fifteen silver dollars.

541
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,720
Master Ning,

542
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
I only borrowed 9 silver dollars from you!

543
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,310
How did it become 15 silver dollars?

544
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,910
The interest is way too high!

545
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,880
Feng Si,

546
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,610
do you know why I didn't come
to collect the debt until now?

547
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,160
You still didn't get it?

548
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,070
I'm a kind-hearted man.

549
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,120
If you try to bail on paying me back,

550
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,250
I'll deal with you like I did
with Old Pan from Xiazhuang.

551
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,350
Your wife and sons

552
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,940
won't even have pants to wear.

553
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,330
No!

554
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,290
Master Ning, Master Ning!

555
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,750
Please give me a few more days.

556
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,160
I've been raising a piglet
for three months now.

557
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,890
I'll pay you as soon as I sell it.

558
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,960
I promise.

559
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,200
Kuangzi, go take a look.

560
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,590
Yes.

561
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,330
What are you doing?

562
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,730
What are you looking at?

563
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,770
Are you trying to rob us?

564
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,590
Let's go! Home!

565
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,330
This...

566
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,880
Go home!

567
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,350
I... I…

568
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,700
You'd better pay my master back quickly.

569
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,110
What kind of person is that?

570
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:14,870
This...

571
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,140
What? Can't Kuangzi take a look?

572
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,410
How many pigs have you raised?

573
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,440
I thought you had 30 or 50 of them.

574
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,520
Only one pig?

575
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,310
You really are a pig yourself.

576
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,460
I know you're up to no good.

577
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,510
You're after our four mu of fertile land
on the slope!

578
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,200
Shut up!

579
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,550
Don't move!

580
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,640
Even your son is smarter than you.

581
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,630
Master Ning, Master Ning!

582
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,490
That small piece of good land is
all I have left.

583
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,860
I can't sell it to you.

584
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,200
Let me tell you, Feng Si.

585
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,520
Get the money ready quickly.

586
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,400
Have it ready,

587
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,640
and bring it to my house
on the 29th of the twelfth lunar month.

588
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
This time I really can't let you off.

589
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,040
Master Ning.

590
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,560
Master Ning.

591
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,000
Master Ning!

592
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,410
Master Ning!

593
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,100
Do you see that?

594
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,950
A wolf that devours people
without spitting out the bones

595
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,150
looks just like that!

596
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,790
What are you looking at?

597
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,270
Never seen Ning the Devil
collecting debts before?

598
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,070
Go, go, go!

599
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,000
Er!

600
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,370
Sister-in-law!

601
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,980
Your guest is here and
you don't even come out to greet me!

602
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,530
Er!

603
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,930
Sister-in-law!

604
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,030
Dajiao!

605
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Xiuxiu!

606
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,920
Your Auntie Si has come to visit you!

607
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,400
Auntie Si,

608
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,180
what brings you here?

609
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,640
What kind of talk is that?

610
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,200
Dajiao and Xiuxiu got married.

611
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,960
I haven't even come to see the bride,

612
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,030
which isn't right of me as her auntie.

613
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,440
I came to see Xiuxiu

614
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,900
and to have a chat with her.

615
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,580
It's been cold these days.

616
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,780
She's... she's sick.

617
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,830
Wait until she's better.

618
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,940
Then I have even more reasons to see her!

619
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,730
No, no, no.

620
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,440
Let me be frank upfront.

621
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,510
My family has grown,

622
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,960
so we don't have spare money

623
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,410
to give to your family anymore.

624
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,310
What are you talking about?

625
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,160
Er.

626
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,790
What did I say?

627
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,110
What did I say?

628
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,160
I didn't say anything.

629
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,600
How could you assume
I'm here to borrow money?

630
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,030
You call that borrowing?

631
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,230
When I come to your house,

632
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,840
can't it be for something else?

633
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,400
I came to your house today...

634
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,200
What is it for?

635
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,400
Er.

636
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,410
It's just that…

637
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,110
I borrowed some money

638
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,550
from Miser Ning.

639
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,180
He just won't let it go.

640
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,590
Not only did he charge a pile of interest,

641
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,450
he also insists

642
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,650
I pay off the debt before New Year.

643
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,900
Where would I get the money?

644
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,310
Er.

645
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,370
My family only has those few mu of land.

646
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,170
There are two children at home

647
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,040
with open mouths waiting to be fed.

648
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,550
Seeing the children

649
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,550
not getting enough to eat

650
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,640
breaks my heart as their mother.

651
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,830
I really have no other options.

652
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,680
Miser Ning says

653
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,380
if I can't repay the money,

654
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,720
he'll take my land as payment.

655
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,070
Si, that good-for-nothing husband of mine,

656
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,030
is useless.

657
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,200
Can you

658
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,290
ask your daughter-in-law to go back home

659
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,640
and beg her father?

660
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,040
And those other small debts—

661
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,950
just wipe them all out, okay?

662
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,550
Er.

663
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,880
Auntie Si.

664
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,200
Xiuxiu!

665
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,070
I've come to see you.

666
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,870
Please help me and your Uncle Si.

667
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,380
Auntie Si,

668
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,000
as you know,

669
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,310
I made a solemn vow
when I left the Ning Residence.

670
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,960
About what you said,

671
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,670
there's nothing I can do.

672
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,240
She can't help you with that.

673
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,110
Did you hear that?

674
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,590
How can you talk like that?

675
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,790
You look so pretty,

676
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,830
but how can you be so cruel?

677
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,960
Sister-in-law, you're not going
to do anything about it?

678
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,440
Er,

679
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,510
you either?

680
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,680
The ancestors

681
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,240
of the Feng family

682
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,520
are all watching us from heaven.

683
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,270
We're full brothers!

684
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,600
This is heartless cruelty!

685
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,050
You're trying to destroy us completely!

686
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,750
Oh heavens above!

687
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,000
We can't live anymore!

688
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,070
When our father-in-law was alive,

689
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,310
you took all his personal savings

690
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,960
to build your new house.

691
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,750
The moment the house was done, you wanted
to split the family property, didn't you?

692
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,400
Did you consider us full brothers then?

693
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,960
Tell me.

694
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,190
What are you saying that?

695
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,469
Why am I here today?

696
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,409
I'm here to ask Xiuxiu for a favor.

697
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,679
I'm not here to beg you and Er.

698
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,600
I don't care who you're asking!

699
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,929
Have you forgotten how you squandered

700
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,070
all Father's money

701
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,960
but stopped taking care of him
and sent him back to us?

702
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,820
Remember that?

703
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,190
You sent him to our house.

704
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,610
It was Dajiao's father and I

705
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,760
who cared for him until his last breath.

706
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,840
And that's not all.

707
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,920
After Father passed away,

708
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,360
you kept coming to borrow food and drinks.

709
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,920
Did you ever pay us back? Even once?

710
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,239
You've ended up like this.

711
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,739
Who can you blame now?

712
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't care!

713
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,190
If today,

714
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,710
you don't ask

715
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,969
your daughter-in-law

716
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,110
to help us out

717
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,960
and if we can't have a decent New Year,

718
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,199
then you won't have a peaceful one either!

719
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,380
I can't go on like this anyway!

720
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,060
I'm laying it all out here.

721
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,000
Go away!

722
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,150
Come on!

723
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,150
Your shoes, take them away!

724
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,880
Take them!

725
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,590
Ganging up against us!

726
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,400
Xiu!

727
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,050
You must be scared.

728
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,900
Child, are you frightened?

729
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,190
Did Auntie Si say anything unpleasant?

730
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,670
No.

731
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,510
I can tell

732
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,960
she's been pushed to the edge.

733
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,630
What are you thinking about?

734
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,680
I was just thinking,

735
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,400
Uncle Si's family has 4 mu of land,

736
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,880
but they still can't support the family,

737
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,680
and they're even in so much debt.

738
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,030
So, besides selling firewood,

739
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,070
eggs,

740
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,280
and grain,

741
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,710
aren't there other ways to make money?

742
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,880
We're farmers.

743
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,910
We just live off the land.

744
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,510
Apart from working as hired hands

745
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,840
during harvest season,

746
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,630
there aren't many other ways
to earn money.

747
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,710
Dajiao,

748
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,110
can selling reed rain cloaks

749
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,670
make money?

750
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,010
How do you know about that?

751
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,600
When I used to help Ning Xuexiang
collect rent,

752
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,280
I saw people giving reed rain cloaks
to Humpback Guo,

753
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,630
but I don't know what they're worth.

754
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,880
Making reed rain cloaks can
bring in some money.

755
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,590
All the families around here
make reed rain cloaks.

756
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,860
After Humpback Guo buys them up,

757
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,300
he sells them to fishermen by the sea.

758
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,670
Each one can earn…

759
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,670
15 cents;

760
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,470
or 20 cents for a good one.

761
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,280
What kind of reed rain cloak
sells for 20 cents?

762
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,960
One that's especially sturdy
yet lightweight.

763
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,110
Do you know how?

764
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,360
Could you teach me?

765
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,630
I do know how,

766
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,230
but I'm

767
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,230
not as good as my mother.

768
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,070
Humpback Guo likes the ones
Mother makes the best.

769
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,710
Alright,

770
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,280
I'll ask Mother to teach me later.

771
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,200
There aren't any reeds now.

772
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,630
We'll have to wait until early autumn.

773
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,670
To be honest,

774
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,560
I don't want you to learn it.

775
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,230
The edges of the reeds
are as sharp as knives.

776
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,030
One cut

777
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,720
and your pretty hands would be ruined.

778
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,970
What good are pretty hands anyway?

779
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,820
They're useful.

780
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,570
How so?

781
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,840
I like them.

782
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,590
So, in winter,

783
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,050
we can't make reed rain cloaks?

784
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,840
We still have some dried reeds

785
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
from last autumn,

786
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,510
but they need to be soaked

787
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,920
in salt water before use.

788
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
If you really want to learn, you can.

789
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,070
Then tomorrow

790
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,350
I'll ask Mother to teach me.

791
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,860
You call her "Mother" so sweetly.

792
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,970
It must make her so happy.

793
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,370
Mother is truly good to me,

794
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,670
and when I call her Mother,

795
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,600
I really mean it.

796
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Let's go to bed.

797
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,870
I'll go get some water.

798
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,140
So, these are the reeds?

799
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,760
They're too dry now.

800
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,470
I'll soak them in alkaline water

801
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,940
for a couple of days,
and then they'll be ready.

802
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,400
When you learn how to make it,

803
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,880
ask Mother to wrap your hands
with cloth strips

804
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,080
so you won't get hurt.

805
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,480
Alright.

806
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,400
You're really nagging.

807
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,000
After we finish eating,

808
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,650
I'll go check on the winter wheat.

809
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,530
It's unusually cold today.

810
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,000
You're checking on the wheat at night?

811
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,400
It's cold and damp today.

812
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,230
I think the weather will change tonight.

813
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,190
Just go inside.

814
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,960
I'll set the fire in a moment.

815
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,630
Xiuxiu.

816
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,670
Susu.

817
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,760
Xiuxiu.

818
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,600
There's something I've never told you,

819
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,810
but it's been weighing on my heart.

820
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,440
What is it?

821
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,550
The night before Wendian left,

822
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,190
we…

823
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
I think we did that thing.

824
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,590
What thing?

825
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,990
We were both drunk,

826
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,440
and then...

827
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,400
He sent this to me

828
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,570
last night.

829
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,030
It's already been presented
to the ancestors.

830
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,290
Do you want to check it?

831
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,320
Xiuxiu,

832
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,840
I thought about it for a long time
before telling you.

833
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,570
Please don't be mad at me, okay?

834
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,190
Susu.

835
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,080
How could I be mad at you?

836
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,200
It's impossible between him and me now.

837
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,200
I'm not thinking about it anymore, either.

838
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,360
I just want to ask you one thing:

839
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,960
do you like Fei Wendian?

840
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,630
I don't know.

841
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,450
But he still has feelings for you,

842
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,960
and he even helped me
find ways to go back.

843
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,800
I only see him as family at most.

844
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,930
As for liking him or not,

845
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,530
I've never thought about it.

846
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,360
Xiuxiu, what should I do now?

847
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,080
I don't have any other solution either.

848
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,110
Now,

849
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,730
you can only stay in the Fei family.

850
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,280
I just hope

851
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,930
you can be as happy

852
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,470
as you were before.

853
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,700
I hope that in the future,

854
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,500
you can gradually accept him,

855
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,060
and I hope he treats you well.

856
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,070
Xiuxiu,

857
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,360
but I'm scared
being in the Fei Residence alone.

858
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,640
Don't be afraid.

859
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,370
Even though Mother is gone,

860
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,040
we're still just like when we were little.

861
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,880
Come to me

862
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,390
if you ever need help.

863
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,960
You're starting to hang lanterns already!

864
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,630
Madam.

865
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,070
Wendian should be back in a day or two.

866
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,110
Keep an ear out

867
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,810
so you don't miss the day to pick him up.

868
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,250
Don't worry, Madam.

869
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,410
Go on with your work.

870
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,000
Uncle Liu.

871
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
How's it looking?

872
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,460
One more!

873
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,170
Boring.

874
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,770
I loved the New Year's festival the most.

875
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,880
But this year I feel like

876
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,910
all their preparations
have nothing to do with me.

877
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,440
It was so nice spending New Year's
at home before.

878
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Mother was there,

879
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,210
and Xiuxiu was there.

880
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,460
My sister would make
paper-cut window decorations every year.

881
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,530
You must be cold!

882
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,120
Is this enough?

883
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,680
Yes.

884
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,930
Sit down and warm yourself by the fire.

885
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,910
I haven't seen Father all day.

886
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,470
He went to the fields again.

887
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,430
Since Father got those 18 mu of land
from Grandpa,

888
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,590
he's been fixated on getting it up to 20.

889
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,650
Careful, it's hot.

890
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,260
The New Year hasn't even arrived yet,

891
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,860
and he's already planning for
spring plowing.

892
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,740
Father has worked so hard

893
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,910
for this family.

894
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,040
I've been thinking,

895
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,480
now that I can't get
the 15 mu of land back,

896
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,010
I can't let Father keep thinking about it.

897
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,160
I was thinking, after the New Year,

898
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,840
I'll talk to Susu

899
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,620
about renting a few more mu from Mrs. Fei.

900
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,880
Do you think it's okay?

901
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,060
Of course it is!

902
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,570
Father and I both feel like
we still have some extra energy.
