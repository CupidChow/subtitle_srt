[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,950
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,350
Do you know she's just a child?

4
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,400
How could you even think of that?

5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,840
Are you even human?

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,810
Kejin. What are you doing?

7
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,229
I'm not dead yet!

8
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,550
You've got no say in this family!

9
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,080
Fine! Today, I'll show you—

10
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,840
as long as I, Ning Kejin,
am standing here,

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
nobody takes my sister away!

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
Get the hell out of here now!

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
Or, I'll beat you to death! Try me!

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Alright.

15
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,110
I've brought Susu back now.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,699
I'll take my leave now.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,750
Mr. Fei!

18
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,500
You can't leave without Susu!

19
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,860
Susu,

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,540
go to the Fei family

21
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,570
as a bride now.

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
From today on,

23
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,829
don't ever mention

24
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,800
that you're a substitute bride
for your sister.

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,460
Bury those words deep inside.

26
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,900
Go to the Fei family,

27
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,630
and be a good wife.

28
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,079
No, Mother. Please, I'm begging you.

29
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,840
Mother!

30
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,990
Mother, you can't do this. Mother!

31
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,010
Kejin!

32
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,470
Kejin. Didn't you hear Mother?

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,810
Hurry up—

34
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
go hitch the cart!

35
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,850
Ning Xuexiang.

36
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,010
We'll settle our matters later.

37
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,270
From now on,

38
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,850
you don't get a say anymore.

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,350
Auntie,

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,820
I can't take her as my wife.

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,960
Mr. Fei.

42
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,430
Auntie.

43
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,000
Let me pay my respects to you.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,460
Mother!

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,420
Mother!

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,560
Mother. What are you doing?

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,079
Mother. Faster get up!

48
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,520
Please also accept my apologies.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,240
Mother. What are you doing?

50
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,230
Send your sister back!

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,360
Susu.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
Mother...

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,680
Let's go, Susu.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,240
Mother!

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,630
Mother...

56
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,400
Mother, I don't want to leave.

57
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,030
Mother... Mother!

58
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,030
What a sin!

59
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,360
Where are you off to?

60
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,800
Where do you think?

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,920
To the fields!

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,540
Does that gruel get to your brain?

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,940
Frost's thick as sheep's wool out there—

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,330
you may as well bed down in the dirt!

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,590
First nine,

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,370
second nine,

67
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,770
hands stay tucked tight.

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,920
Third nine,

69
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,839
fourth nine,

70
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,579
tread the ice light.

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,899
Fifth nine,

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,800
sixth nine,

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
see willows in sight.

74
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,690
Seventh nine, rivers thaw;

75
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,740
Eighth nine, wild geese scream.

76
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,210
Ninth nine plus one more,

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,050
fields with oxen teem.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,920
Fields with oxen teem.

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
Fields with oxen teem.

80
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,240
Uncle Liu.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,310
Uncle Liu.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,320
Uncle Liu.

83
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,630
We're back!

84
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,870
Is the warehouse cleared out?

85
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,680
All set.

86
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,910
Then let's get them to move the stuff.

87
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,960
Madam is back.

88
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,870
Did the collection go smoothly
with these households?

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,870
Nope.

90
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,310
The same old story at year-end.

91
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,310
They all know I'm a pushover,

92
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,970
so they beg poverty to my face.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,190
You take over tomorrow.

94
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,270
This job isn't physically tiring,

95
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,070
but it's mentally exhausting.

96
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,040
Sister-in-law!

97
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,440
Sister-in-law!

98
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,510
What's the matter?

99
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,020
I wanna go home and see my family.

100
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,750
Didn't you just go back yesterday?

101
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,680
My mother's sick—real bad sick.

102
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,170
I'm worried about her.

103
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,340
Yesterday when I was home,

104
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,960
I didn't even get to really talk with her.

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,820
I couldn't sleep a wink all night.

106
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,270
Alright,

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,350
don't worry too much.

108
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,470
Go wait inside—

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,900
I'll ask Qing to hitch the cart
and send you back.

110
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,430
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

111
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,630
Now that the Young Mistress is leaving...

112
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,870
you don't think she'd truly never return?

113
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,310
We can't stop her
from visiting her mother.

114
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,550
If she truly meant to leave us...

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,270
yesterday,

116
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
she'd have refused the cart.

117
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,950
Have Qing prepare the cart—

118
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,870
send her back.

119
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,950
Qing, prepare the cart!

120
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,510
Woman of Dajiao!

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,360
Woman of Dajiao!

122
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Step out here—

123
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,070
gotta word with you.

124
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,330
You may call me

125
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,800
by my name.

126
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,280
Isn't Woman of Dajiao

127
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,930
your name?

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,900
That's what all folks holler!

129
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,110
It doesn't sit right with me.

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,360
When you're with us dirt-folk,

131
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,560
you answer

132
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
to dirt-folk names!

133
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,090
Get over here.

134
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,090
I need to tell you about something.

135
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,710
Like the old saying goes,

136
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,070
"wed to a cock, walk his walk;

137
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,360
wed to a cur, no demur;

138
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,540
wed to a bear, go where it'd fare."

139
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,240
Right?

140
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,750
Now you're wed into our Feng family,

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,720
that makes you one of us.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,070
Right?

143
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,130
There are some matters

144
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,740
to put plain to you.

145
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Now, in this village,

146
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,360
who's got which field,

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,430
which soil's best—

148
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,350
nobody knows better than me.

149
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,560
To put it plainly:

150
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,310
There are four prime plots.

151
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,560
Here they are—

152
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,800
First, your second uncle's

153
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,940
32 mu.

154
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
Next,

155
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,159
Tietou's 13 mu.

156
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,720
Then,

157
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,000
the 15 mu to the west of the well,

158
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,430
which is the very land your father

159
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,040
promised to our family.

160
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,120
Last,

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,510
the 50 mu held by Mrs. Fei.

162
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,630
We shall strike
while the iron's hot, I say.

163
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,870
A dowry's only proper.

164
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,530
You need to go home now
and ask for the land deed—

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
make your father sign.

166
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,430
I'll take the papers

167
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,580
straight to the county office,

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,490
get the red seal stamped,

169
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,430
and keep the blank copy...

170
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,430
Spare your words—

171
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,890
I've gotten the point.

172
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,620
If I fail to bring back those 15-mu,

173
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,870
will the Feng family cast me out?

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,680
Well...

175
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,430
If you want it raw—

176
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,510
here's your bitter truth!

177
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,390
When you crawled back
from that bandits' lair,

178
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,630
you'd have moldered in your hut,

179
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,000
died an old maid—

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,530
not a soul would've wed you.

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It was our Dajiao
who made you his lawful wife

182
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,549
with a proper eight-man bridal escort!

183
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,620
By any measure,

184
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
we're your family's salvation.

185
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,000
Isn't that so?

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,750
You can disown
that puffy-eyed father of yours,

187
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,750
but that very father

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,910
has to admit those 15 mu!

189
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,550
He gave his word!

190
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,910
It's not like I'm taking it for free—

191
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,270
I offered to pay! Right?

192
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,510
Call me lowlife scum

193
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,890
if I were grabbing it for free.

194
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,440
But I can pay fair and square! Right?

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,390
So go home. Fetch the land deed.

196
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,040
Understand?

197
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,100
With the land deed—

198
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
Are you listening—you keep gasping.

199
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,620
Are you going to listen or not?

200
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,910
Let me tell you, a decent person

201
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,850
repays debts of gratitude.

202
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,510
Without that,

203
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
a man is even worse than animals.

204
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,870
Hey,

205
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,830
are you going or not?

206
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,110
Did any of this sink in or not?

207
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,790
Hey, say something!

208
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,840
Fine!

209
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,450
If you bring back the land deed,

210
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,720
you'll remain
our family's daughter-in-law.

211
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,910
♪ When Old Bao leaves
the capital in sight ♪

212
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,170
♪ Both palaces scramble

213
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,480
Mother!

214
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,510
Mother,

215
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,320
please have some.

216
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,390
Come on, take a sip.

217
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,010
Pass it to me.

218
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,680
You refuse to eat and drink—

219
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,300
wallowing in your misery…

220
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,460
But really, you're making me suffer.
Isn't that so?

221
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm not trying to torment you.

222
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,290
When Xiuxiu left,

223
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,630
she didn't even have a full belly.

224
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,630
As her mother,

225
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,760
just thinking of it
brings pain in my chest.

226
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,720
I can't swallow a bite either.

227
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Listen to me—

228
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,400
what's done is done.

229
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,140
Even if you drown yourself in misery,

230
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,530
our girl won't be back.

231
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,090
You wanna die? Fine.

232
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,400
Easy way out for you.

233
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,640
But what's left for me?

234
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,000
What's left for the family?

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,630
Father,

236
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,130
with Mother like this,

237
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,570
can you just hold back a little?

238
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,720
Go rest inside—I've got things here.

239
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,830
Just rest.

240
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,640
Father.

241
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,840
Mother!

242
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Mother!

243
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Why are you back?

244
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,540
I was so worried about Mother,
barely slept a wink.

245
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,510
Mrs. Fei sent a cart to bring me home.

246
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,080
Mother.

247
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,480
Susu.

248
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,270
How are you feeling now?

249
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,480
Why are you back?

250
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,200
I've been worried about you.

251
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,000
Look at me! I'm okay, aren't I?

252
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,010
Come here.

253
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,380
Come on here.

254
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,830
Sit on the bed.

255
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,130
Yesterday, I didn't even
get a chance to ask you.

256
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,550
Susu,

257
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,410
are you settling in well
at the Fei family?

258
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,870
Mother, I don't know
what exactly good means.

259
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,120
But out at the Fei Residence—

260
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,320
I get to pick my meals!

261
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,450
Mrs. Fei acts like
she's scared to offend me—

262
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,750
always talking soft-like,

263
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,550
all smiles when she speaks to me.

264
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,410
What about Fei Wendian?
Does he treat you right?

265
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,930
I barely catch sight of him.

266
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,730
He's always buried in his books.

267
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,480
Ah, look at our Susu—such a wise heart!

268
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,510
Now this is a daughter
who bears the family's weight.

269
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,150
Here.

270
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,480
Mother,

271
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,740
let's have a bit more.

272
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,990
Mother, don't you fret now—

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,800
just focus on healing properly.

274
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,960
Here. Take a sip.

275
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,910
Here.

276
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,200
Susu,

277
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,000
this wasn't to harm you—

278
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,600
I would love to keep you home—

279
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,240
for years, as you wish.

280
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,550
But after what happened,

281
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,440
finding a husband won't be easy for you.

282
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,120
Better you pick

283
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,390
than be picked over.

284
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,960
Fei Wendian is the best match—

285
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,650
we know his family well,

286
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,520
and he's from a well-off family.

287
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,550
Marry him, and build a good life together.

288
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,360
Susu.

289
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,440
Don't blame me for being incapable
of providing anything better.

290
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,150
Susu...

291
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,200
Mother,

292
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,670
I don't blame you.

293
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,450
But my sister blames me.

294
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,090
She won't even talk to me.

295
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,440
About your sister...

296
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,670
I'll explain things

297
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,670
to her in the future.

298
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Is she truly gone for good,

299
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,470
living in poverty with Feng Dajiao?

300
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,030
I can understand if she avoids Father—

301
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,490
but to shut you out as well?

302
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,670
Not a single thought for her mother?

303
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,960
Xiuxiu, my child.
Don't cry, Mother.

304
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
Take a rest now.

305
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,130
Lie down.

306
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,400
Mother.

307
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,670
Xiuxiu.

308
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
Mother, I swear—

309
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,880
I'll carve a path to bring my sister back.

310
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,360
Xiuxiu.

311
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,790
My child,

312
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,590
you're my everything.

313
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,300
Xiuxiu...

314
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:33,960
Xiuxiu.

315
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,240
Xiuxiu!

316
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,940
Mother,

317
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,960
where's Xiuxiu?

318
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,670
I've no idea.

319
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,790
I went to get shoe patterns.

320
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,120
I've no idea about that.

321
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,960
Where'd she go?

322
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,090
What's in your hand?

323
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,960
It's tooth powder I bought for Xiuxiu.

324
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,020
Hide it—don't let your father see it.

325
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,660
Always with the spending!

326
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,200
Where is she? Xiuxiu.

327
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,750
Xiuxiu?

328
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,070
Where did Xiuxiu go? Do you know?

329
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,280
She returned home to get the land deed.

330
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,580
Why? I thought she said
to disown her father and land?

331
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,440
Why is she back for the land deed now?

332
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,200
I told her to go get it.

333
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,100
She asked me...

334
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,060
What did she ask?

335
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,570
She asked if she fails
in getting the land deed,

336
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,080
will our family cast her out?

337
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,270
What did you say then?

338
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,840
What could I say?

339
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,680
I just laid out the facts for her.

340
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,150
Next thing I know,
she's gone for the land deed.

341
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,840
Father!

342
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,860
Aren't you hounding her straight
to the grave!

343
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,910
Xiuxiu!

344
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,670
Why bother looking for her?

345
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
Once she gets the deed,

346
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,750
she'll come back.

347
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,480
Xiuxiu!

348
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,120
So you are really here.

349
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,310
I've been looking for you everwhere.

350
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,710
Zhuzi's wife said
you came behind the hill.

351
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,360
Dajiao.

352
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,490
Just leave me be.

353
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,180
Let me go...

354
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,620
Where are you heading to then?

355
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,660
A girl like you—where would you go?

356
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,180
I won't let you leave.

357
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,400
Then, what's the point of staying?

358
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,140
I'd rather die

359
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,170
than take back those 15 mu.

360
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,960
I know. I understand that.

361
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,050
I won't let you take it,

362
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,450
neither would my mother.

363
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,270
If my father forces you again,
I won't tolerate it.

364
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,230
Dajiao,

365
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
you've done more than enough for me.

366
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,890
I can't have you

367
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,030
turn cold with your father

368
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,140
because of me.

369
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,220
Who cares about that now?

370
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,380
Did you think I'd abandon you?

371
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Xiuxiu,

372
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,680
if you truly want to leave,

373
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,610
I'll go with you.

374
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,550
Worst to the worst,
we can flee to Manchuria.

375
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,790
With my strength,

376
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,440
I'll earn our keep anywhere.

377
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,150
They say up there—

378
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,120
land stretches wide and rich

379
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,450
in the northeast China.

380
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,510
I'll make it work.

381
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,910
Dajiao.

382
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,900
It's hard to live
at the Feng Residence anymore—

383
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,130
but I won't end my life foolishly.

384
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,970
I had even survived the bandits' lair.

385
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,440
I'm familiar with this place.

386
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,119
I used to come here a lot
when I was a child.

387
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,160
Can you please help me

388
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,510
to build a shed here?

389
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,500
It's sheltered from the wind—

390
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,910
might last the winter.

391
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,319
I want my father

392
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,859
and your father to see,

393
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,230
that I'll survive

394
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,710
without the Feng family.

395
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,850
I won't take a single bit of land
from the Ning family either.

396
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,960
T—To build a shed here—

397
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,050
just for you, all alone...

398
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,610
Well...

399
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,370
Even in my misery,
you'd still laugh at me?

400
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,670
I'm not laughing at you.

401
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,670
It's just that...

402
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,870
Let me see.

403
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm fine.

404
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,030
You're burning up like charcoal!

405
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,620
We're not going anywhere.

406
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,340
I'm fine.

407
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,960
We're going home.

408
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,790
Put me down.

409
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,920
My father has lost his rationality
over that land.

410
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,550
Let me down.

411
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,370
We'll also show

412
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,370
your father

413
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,120
that you, Xiuxiu, lives better than all!

414
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Let's go home now.

415
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,650
I'll make it clear today.

416
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,680
If anyone brings up
those 15 mu of land again,

417
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,210
I'll...

418
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,990
Hush, Dajiao!

419
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,340
I know you're frantic
over Xiuxiu's illness—

420
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,270
but reckless oaths solve nothing.

421
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,880
We're family. Save your breath.

422
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,350
Old man—

423
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,660
put this to our boy straight:

424
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,860
Not another word about that land,

425
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,830
or the next thing planted
will be a fresh grave.

426
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,720
What grave?

427
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,680
What's wrong with a dowry? Besides,

428
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,030
name one bride who went without a dowry!

429
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,160
Xiuxiu has no dowry.

430
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,160
Then tell me what those 15 mu land are.

431
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,730
Why exactly do we reject prime land—

432
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,480
the richest in the village?

433
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,580
Good or bad—none of your concern.

434
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,440
This is my final word on the matter.

435
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,230
If you bring up those 15 mu parcels again,

436
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,200
I'll take Xiuxiu and flee to Manchuria.

437
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,310
We'll never come back.

438
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,660
Hold your tongue!

439
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,440
You may just forget you ever had a son.

440
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,130
Dajiao!

441
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,190
The pup's grown fangs!

442
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,830
"Flee to Manchuria," huh?

443
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,610
Why not "cross the Western Pass",

444
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,200
or "sail to the South Seas"?

445
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,080
Don't say I didn't warn you—

446
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,190
if Dajiao leaves now,

447
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,020
you may never see him again.

448
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,990
Why is fate so cruel to me?

449
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,360
Why is this happening...

450
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,880
Wendian.

451
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,030
Wendian.

452
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,880
Wendian.

453
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,200
Xiuxiu.

454
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,230
Let's go.

455
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,160
Not you.

456
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,650
It's Dajiao.

457
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,640
I'll draw him away—

458
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,030
run the moment he's gone!

459
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,830
Don't!

460
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,920
Dajiao!

461
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,820
It's Dajiao.

462
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,030
Dajiao.

463
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,430
I'm here.

464
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,710
Xiu.

465
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,090
I'll always be with you.

466
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,210
Xiu.

467
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,550
You're awake.

468
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,020
Dajiao...

469
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
you've stayed by my side.

470
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,030
What are you trying to do?

471
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,550
I...

472
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,440
I want to get dressed.

473
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,270
Then I'll go outside.

474
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,720
Xiu,

475
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,900
your fever hasn't broken.

476
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,250
Stay down—just rest.

477
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,500
I broke the bowl.

478
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,320
It's alright.

479
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,510
Oh, she's awake.

480
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,820
Come here.

481
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,090
This illness served you.

482
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,280
All that pent-up rage needed release—

483
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,940
or it would've destroyed you.

484
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,570
Dajiao.

485
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,950
Go get brown sugar from Humpback Guo now—

486
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,790
Xiuxiu needs strength.

487
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,730
On my way!

488
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,550
It's not necessary.

489
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,590
Don't bother about that.
Take your medicine.

490
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,180
Here.

491
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,460
Let me tell you—

492
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,400
Dajiao warned his father yesterday.

493
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,590
Easy, easy.

494
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,270
He said to his father,

495
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,970
"If you mention that land again,

496
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,580
we're fleeing to Manchuria together!"

497
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,580
That's exactly
what his father's afraid of—

498
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,240
he's afraid of losing Dajiao.

499
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,240
This tactic worked like a charm.

500
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,530
It's all right now. Take it slowly.

501
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,750
Now rest easy.

502
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,070
I'll cook millet porridge for you,

503
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,570
and Dajiao will mix in brown sugar
when he's back

504
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,370
to restore your strength.

505
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,680
Take your medicine.

506
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,720
Excuse me,

507
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,750
where's Feng Dajiao's home, please?

508
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,400
Here it is.

509
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,150
Thank you.

510
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,110
Who are you?

511
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,330
I'm looking for my sister Xiuxiu.

512
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,000
Miss Susu.

513
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,840
Your sister's ill—

514
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,860
I'm making millet porridge
with brown sugar

515
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,400
to rebuild her strength.

516
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,130
Is her condition serious?

517
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,760
The fever's broken now.

518
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,700
No worries—

519
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,010
just let her rest and she'll recover.

520
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,960
Rest assured—

521
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,240
our family won't wrong your sister.

522
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,540
Could you ask my sister—

523
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
tell her that I'm here...

524
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,030
would she see me?

525
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,510
Sisters stand on no such ceremony!

526
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,670
Follow me—I'll take you to her.

527
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,880
This way!

528
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,160
Xiuxiu.

529
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,210
Come on in.

530
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,920
Xiu.

531
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,850
Your little sister's here to see you.

532
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,400
Xiuxiu.

533
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,890
Xiuxiu,

534
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,270
Mother's fallen ill,

535
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,880
how come you're sick too?

536
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,220
Is your mother okay?

537
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,510
Xiuxiu, have the porridge while it's warm.

538
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,510
Don't let it cool.

539
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,990
You sisters chat—

540
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,640
I've work to tend to.

541
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,680
Xiuxiu,

542
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,400
are you still mad at me?

543
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,790
Susu,

544
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,830
why would you marry Fei Wendian?

545
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,350
It was Father.

546
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,520
He promised if I took that bridal sedan,

547
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,000
it'd buy time to save you—

548
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,450
swore he'd swap me out once you returned.

549
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,230
But...

550
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,210
he never came to swap me out.

551
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,560
Furthermore, he forced me
to stay at the Fei Residence.

552
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,350
Come here.

553
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,880
I doomed you.

554
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,480
He only cares about land—

555
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,160
never treated us as his daughters.

556
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,070
Xiuxiu.

557
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,740
As long as you return safe,

558
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,830
my suffering

559
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,110
means nothing.

560
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,080
Just one thing, please—
never shut me out again.

561
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,590
Let's be true sisters
like before.

562
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,530
I'll always be your elder sister.

563
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,310
We will

564
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,790
always be sisters.

565
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,740
So you'll cut my window flowers,

566
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,920
trim my bangs,

567
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,640
care for me like in the old days?

568
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,470
I promise you.

569
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,370
Xiuxiu,

570
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,790
have some.

571
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,710
Look how skinny you've become!

572
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,510
Slowly.

573
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,280
It's hot.

574
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,400
Xiuxiu,

575
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,670
let's go home.

576
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,860
Mother's ill with longing for you—

577
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,960
hasn't eaten in days.

578
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,570
I ache for Mother too...

579
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,920
but this lifetime,

580
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,540
my feet can never cross
the Ning's threshold again.

581
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,370
Susu,

582
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
take this

583
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,720
to Mother for me.

584
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,510
Tell her

585
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,150
I'm doing well at Dajiao's—

586
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,510
plenty to eat and drink,

587
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,640
no hardships at all.

588
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,480
Never ever tell Mother

589
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,830
I've been ill.

590
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,520
I'll find a way to visit her.

591
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,350
Wendian.

592
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,930
Sister-in-law, I'm here.

593
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,340
Qing said you were looking for me.

594
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,520
Sister-in-law.

595
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,790
I've overstayed this time—

596
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,540
heading back to school tomorrow.

597
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,760
Leaving so soon?

598
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,960
Fine, you may go—

599
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,340
but you owe Susu a proper closure.

600
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,240
Sister-in-law.

601
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,070
I've already escorted her back—

602
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,030
what more closure could she need?

603
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,440
What closure do you think then?

604
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,120
You were the one who married her—

605
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,110
a grown man like you

606
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,550
needs coaching on this?

607
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,000
Let me tell you:

608
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
the Fei Residence

609
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,060
has been quiet for too long...

610
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,440
it's time for newborns.

611
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,650
Sister-in-law,

612
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,800
I swear I won't touch her.

613
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,110
Qing.

614
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,230
Prepare a couple extra dishes tonight

615
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,490
for the Young Master's farewell dinner.

616
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,740
When you miss Mother,

617
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,670
just touch the jade pendant.

618
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,510
Mother, it's right here.

619
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,270
Xiuxiu, if I miss you,

620
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,890
I'll touch this pendant too.

621
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,510
These jade pendants—

622
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,420
Grandma gave them to me

623
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,400
as part of my dowry.

624
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,330
You've worn them since childhood.

625
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,300
And now, I pass them to you both

626
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,230
as your dowries.

627
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,550
Don't be sad anymore.

628
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,590
My girl's come back to me!

629
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,590
Mother,

630
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,920
please get better soon.

631
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,350
Here, have some porriage first.

632
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,910
Finally, she's willing to eat something.

633
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,640
Madam,

634
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,660
Qing from the Fei family is here,
urging Miss Susu's return.

635
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,720
I'm not going back!

636
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,200
Mother, I want to stay
and take care of you.

637
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,460
Madam, Mrs. Fei sent Qing with a message:

638
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,640
If Miss Susu wishes to visit you,

639
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,860
she can send a cart any time.

640
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,780
But Miss Susu and Mr. Fei
just got married,

641
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,720
staying long at her maiden home

642
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,640
might stir gossip.

643
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,790
Mrs. Fei

644
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,440
makes a fair point.

645
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,160
Susu,

646
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,880
listen to me,

647
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,760
you must go back.

648
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,740
How about this:

649
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,830
let Susu feed you this bowl of porriage,
then she'll go back.

650
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,760
Is that alright?

651
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Will that be okay?

652
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,320
I'll finish this porridge,

653
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,810
and you'll go back.

654
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,960
Xiu,

655
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,720
I know

656
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,370
you need this daily.

657
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,960
Only secondhand ones
left at Humpback Guo's place,

658
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,160
so I bought it for you.

659
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,480
Here you are.

660
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,180
But we already have one at home, don't we?

661
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,010
You can't even see a reflection anymore
with that.

662
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,540
I'll polish it up tomorrow.

663
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,270
So bright!

664
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,730
So beautiful!

665
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,700
What's the matter?

666
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,960
What's on your mind?

667
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,960
I miss my mother.

668
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,750
Susu said...

669
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
She's real sick now,

670
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,040
but still asks for me every day.

671
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,920
How about...

672
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,270
I go home with you to see your mother?

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,920
I swore an oath—

674
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,070
never to step foot
in the Ning Residence again.

675
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,200
Huh?

676
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,270
I make him stay?

677
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,790
How can I make him stay?

678
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,880
If he wants to leave,
how could I stop him?

679
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
I don't have that kind of power.

680
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,000
Sister-in-law, truth be told—

681
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,520
we barely even talk.

682
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,360
Even if you locked us in a room together—

683
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,440
I could count our conversations...

684
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,190
on one hand.

685
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,760
Susu,

686
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,659
he's your man, your rock.

687
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,469
You can't just let him leave like this!

688
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,469
Even if he leaves,

689
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,929
you've got to make him—

690
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,100
make him leave something behind for you.

691
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,810
Sister-in-law.

692
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,110
These—all these—

693
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,699
all these are yours! What's he got?

694
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,310
Just those raggedy old books

695
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,280
that he has been carrying,
hugging, and holding all the time.

696
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,440
Like I'd even want that!

697
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,000
That's not exactly what I mean.

698
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,880
Then tell me.

699
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,670
I mean—

700
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,270
You have to make him
leave you a child!

701
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,940
Sister-in-law! What are you talking about?

702
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,340
That's so embarrassing!

703
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,960
I can't do that.

704
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,750
You've got to do it anyway.

705
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,440
How can this go on otherwise?

706
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,910
Wendian, pour yourself a drink too.

707
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,450
You're leaving soon,

708
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,360
and I can't keep you here.

709
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,590
So let's at least

710
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,800
share a farewell toast.

711
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,550
Come—

712
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,730
this one's for you.

713
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,030
Susu, join us.

714
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:43,920
Cheers.

715
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,640
I'll pour my own.

716
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,640
Like what I said before,

717
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,360
When you're out there,

718
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,670
you have to take care of yourself.

719
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,550
Don't go looking for trouble,

720
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,300
and remember to send word home.

721
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,500
I'll be right here,

722
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,800
waiting for your return.

723
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,850
We'll enjoy
a great New Year's celebration together.

724
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,560
Let me toast you again.

725
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,800
Join us, Susu.

726
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,800
After the New Year,

727
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
our Fei family

728
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,130
will see better days.

729
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,710
I love New Year's celebrations so much.

730
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,470
but this year,

731
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,200
I won't make it home.

732
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,730
Missing your maiden family again?

733
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,190
Cheer her up.

734
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:50,930
Susu,

735
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,440
let me toast you.

736
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,780
You know the truth—

737
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,430
though we held

738
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,320
the wedding ceremony,

739
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,960
neither of us wanted this.

740
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,660
So you're still a free person.

741
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,230
Whenever you wish

742
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
to leave the Fei family,

743
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,360
just ask for my help.

744
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,850
I won't refuse you.

745
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,000
What kind of talk is this?

746
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,070
Susu—

747
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,970
he doesn't mean to drive you away!

748
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,100
Susu,

749
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,020
indeed, I don't want to drive you away.

750
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,580
My parents don't want me,

751
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,730
where am I supposed to go now?

752
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,320
You don't need to go anywhere.

753
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,980
Our Fei family is good enough!

754
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,070
New Year's celebrations here
are lively too—

755
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,190
paper cuttings, couplets on the doors,

756
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,520
and even firecrackers!

757
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,240
We have that from New Year's Eve
all the way till the 15th day!

758
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,640
Do you like temple fairs?

759
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,590
The one at Goddess Mountain, right?

760
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,210
Later, Wendian and I will take you
to the temple fair!

761
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,360
That sounds great, Sister-in-law.

762
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,020
I love temple fairs very much.

763
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,110
Cheers. Let's drink this up.

764
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,420
Sister-in-law, I'd like to toast you too.

765
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,940
Sure.

766
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,230
Susu,

767
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,490
let me toast you again.

768
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,920
May your days ahead

769
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,400
always be this joyful.

770
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,920
If you could...

771
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,090
remain this heavenly being forever,

772
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,230
that would be just great.

773
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,520
What's a heavenly being?

774
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,630
Sister-in-law, is he taking
a roundabout jab at me?

775
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,440
Nah.

776
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,250
Susu, I'm complimenting you.

777
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,670
He's complimenting you.

778
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,160
A heavenly being?
That's someone from the heavens—

779
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,760
so an immortal fairy, right?

780
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,750
This fairy will drink with you!

781
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,210
Cheers!

782
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,070
Normally, I'm always the one
keeping you in line,

783
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,400
never letting you drink.

784
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,150
But today—go ahead,
drink to your heart's content!

785
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,280
I'll drink with you.

786
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,130
Come on. Let's toast together!

787
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,480
Do you feel the heat too?

788
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,280
Sister-in-law,

789
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,340
I feel the heat too.

790
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,740
Can you have someone
remove this brazier?

791
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,800
Sure.

792
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,540
Alright, you two go on here.

793
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,710
I'll get them to remove the brazier—

794
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,280
and bring a couple more dishes!

795
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,100
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

796
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,020
No problem.

797
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,550
Sister-in-law, don't bother with that.

798
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,590
Not at all.

799
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,920
Wendian, this liquor tastes sweet.

800
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,420
I'll have one more glass of it.

801
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,210
Nice.

802
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,430
It heats so much!

803
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,360
Why does it heat so much?

804
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,550
Sit properly.

805
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,520
Why does it heat so much?

806
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,190
Why does it heat so much, Wendian?

807
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,900
Why does it heat so much?

808
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,610
You drank too much.

809
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,260
You're drunk.

810
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,070
I'm not drunk at all.

811
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
The two of us—

812
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,800
just sacrificial pawns in this farce.

813
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,770
You're the sacrificial pawn—

814
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,890
I'm not.

815
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,070
Father...

816
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,670
Mother...

817
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,840
Why won't you let me come home?

818
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,080
Xiuxiu...

819
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,930
Xiuxiu...

820
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,470
Xiuxiu... is that you, Xiuxiu?

821
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,300
Xiuxiu. Don't leave me!

822
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,840
I want to cherish you through a lifetime.

823
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
For a lifetime,

824
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,920
you'll be mine.

825
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,670
Xiuxiu...

826
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,440
Xiuxiu.

827
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,360
Xiuxiu.

828
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,440
Ancestors of the Fei family,

829
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,990
I humbly pray for your blessings—

830
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,740
grant Wendian a son without fail.

831
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,480
Grant Wendian a son without fail.
