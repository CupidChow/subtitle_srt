00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,890
[Episode 21]

3
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,680
Retreat! Retreat!

4
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,150
Dajiao!

5
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,360
Dajiao!

6
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,050
You're going to be a father!

7
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,650
What?

8
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,630
You're going to be a father!

9
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Pinch me.

10
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm really going to be a father.

11
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,030
Mother said

12
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,910
the rosy shadow cast on my belly

13
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,710
indicated the baby must be a boy.

14
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,840
Our first child is a boy,

15
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,300
adding one more strong laborer
to the family.

16
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,310
Son,

17
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,630
come out soon.

18
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,150
Father will teach you how to farm.

19
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,410
What are you mumbling?

20
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,190
My son is speaking to me.

21
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,520
Father, Mother,

22
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,990
I'll be out with you soon. Wait for me!

23
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,750
Xiu,

24
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,880
I was only gone for 10-odd days,

25
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,640
but it felt forever.

26
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,320
Today was

27
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,190
such a long day.

28
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,970
I felt like half a lifetime was spent.

29
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,520
Dajiao,

30
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,090
when you rescued me

31
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,730
from that crowd today,

32
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,520
were you not terrified?

33
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:09,960
I was.

34
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,360
I couldn't think of anything at that time,

35
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
except

36
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,320
that I must save you.

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,390
The sight of you seemed to

38
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,130
have put me in a trance.

39
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,000
I felt like I was back to the time

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,270
when you first rescued me

41
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,000
from the bandits.

42
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,830
Look,

43
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,950
you saved me from the bandits again.

44
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,270
Xiu,

45
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,470
haven't you noticed?

46
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm meant to be your lifesaver.

47
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,020
God sent me here

48
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,630
to save your life.

49
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,000
Then please tell God not to

50
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,150
let the same thing happen again, okay?

51
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,120
Kejin asked me

52
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,550
to attend a celebration tonight,

53
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,060
saying that I'm a hero
for fighting off the bandits.

54
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
But in my opinion,

55
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,070
you're the true hero.

56
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,630
You are a hero. A big hero.

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
You should attend it.

58
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,130
What about you?

59
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,170
I have my things to do.

60
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,030
I'll stick with you then.

61
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,380
Let me hear what our son has to say again.

62
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,840
Who is it?

63
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,270
It's me.

64
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,430
Dajiao.

65
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,190
Dajiao.

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,040
What brings you here from the celebration?

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Without you two,

68
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,270
how could that be called a celebration?

69
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,730
Drinks?

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Sure.

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,430
Shall we have drinks here or inside?

72
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,690
It's up to you, Dajiao.

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,360
If you fear
that the bandits may come again,

74
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,290
let's drink here. I'll be with you.

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,390
With the Qingqi Society around

76
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,630
and the government's support,

77
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,080
those bandits wouldn't dare to come.

78
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,680
Besides,

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,310
Feng Si's wife and their sons

80
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,140
were tied up in that room.

81
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,800
They can't escape even if they had wings.

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Let's go in to drink.

83
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
As you please.

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,510
Let's go.

85
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,190
Sure. Come on.

86
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,490
Go.

87
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm here to help you.

88
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,520
I brought you some food.

89
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,160
It's enough to sustain you for a few days.

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
Come on, let me untie you.

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,210
Come on.

92
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,720
Niwei.

93
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,750
Hurry. Run!

94
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,950
Run!

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Kneel to Xiuxiu and thank her now.

96
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,700
I'll never kneel to anyone
from the Ning family.

97
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,830
There's no time for quarrels.

98
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,510
You must run before it's too late.

99
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,040
Let's go.

100
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,600
Go.

101
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,630
I'll avenge my father someday.

102
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Listen up,

103
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,310
your father was the victim
of his own scheming.

104
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,120
But his wife and sons are not to blame.

105
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,450
There's one more thing.

106
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,680
Stop thinking about avenging him.

107
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,810
Just take good care of
your mother and brother.

108
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,900
Be their backbone.

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,390
Go!

110
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,190
Go!

111
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,330
Hurry!

112
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
I swear I'll make Ning Xuexiang suffer.

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,970
Run!

114
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Here, hold your brother.

115
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,430
Xiuxiu,

116
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,090
thank you so much.

117
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,800
Just run.

118
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,480
-Thank you.
-That way.

119
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,530
Get up!

120
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,470
Get up now!

121
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,750
Father!

122
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,390
I promise I'll avenge you.

123
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,550
I'll get all our land back!

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,840
I'll kill all those who harmed you!

125
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,530
All of them!

126
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,540
Let's go.

127
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,630
Just manage to live.

128
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,490
You must first
keep yourself alive by all means.

129
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,020
Hurry. Run!

130
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,310
Run!

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,510
Run!

132
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,620
Ancestors of the Fei family,

133
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,140
bandits raided the village.

134
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,360
Thankfully,

135
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
with your blessings,

136
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,030
we weathered through it

137
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,270
and stayed safe.

138
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,909
I'm kneeling

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,780
and kowtowing here

140
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,890
in gratitude for your protection.

141
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,110
Xiuxiu wasn't raped by the bandits.

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,990
What am I going to tell Wendian

143
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,600
when he finds it out?

144
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
What do you think?

145
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,110
It's pretty.

146
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,340
Absolutely gorgeous.

147
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,580
Dajiao, have you noticed?

148
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,910
This bathtub

149
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,360
has brightened up the room.

150
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,740
I've decided.

151
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,910
When it's not being used,

152
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,960
I'll hang it up.

153
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,980
Looking at it brings joy to me.

154
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,080
I knew you'd like it.

155
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,910
I do like it.

156
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,080
You haven't told me

157
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,630
about your journey yet.

158
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,810
What does the ocean look like?

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Come here.

160
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,940
Let me tell you.

161
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,600
Sit.

162
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,000
I didn't expect

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
to come cross

164
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,600
such a vast ocean on my way.

165
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,970
It was borderless.

166
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I was wondering

167
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,090
what an enormous basin
there must be under the sea

168
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,950
to hold that huge amount of water.

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It looked blue.

170
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,960
During the day,

171
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,480
the color made me dizzy.

172
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,570
As I saw it at night,

173
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,640
it was pitch black and terrifying.

174
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,070
I watched the fishermen

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,220
heading out to sea at the crack of dawn.

176
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,360
They're so accustomed to staying at sea

177
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
that when they come ashore,

178
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,460
they'd feel uncomfortable.

179
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,210
They think

180
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,780
they'd fall
when walking on the flat ground.

181
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,210
But unlike them,

182
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,290
I can't bear being on the boat.

183
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,170
Every time the boat rocked, I felt sick.

184
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,030
Each sway made me want to throw up.

185
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,500
I was even vomiting bile in the end.

186
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,790
Xiu,

187
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,440
this journey

188
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,630
taught me one thing:

189
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,320
fate is predetermined.

190
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,940
Think about the water creatures—

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,320
fish, shrimp, crabs, and turtles—

192
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
and the fishermen
who make a living at sea.

193
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,150
The ocean is indispensable

194
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,030
to their lives.

195
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,550
Another kind of creatures

196
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,200
has to live off the land.

197
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,550
That single-horned ox is an example.

198
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,840
So are cattle, horses and sheep.

199
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,870
Plus, we

200
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,030
crop farmers

201
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,840
can't live our lives without land.

202
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
During my trip,

203
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
not a moment went by

204
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,200
without me thinking about
coming home to farm.

205
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,130
I missed you and my parents so much.

206
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,510
It's my opinion

207
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,120
that since I was born
and raised on this land,

208
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,750
in the end,

209
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,020
I shall be buried in this land.

210
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you know what I mean?

211
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Yes, I do.

212
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,960
Now, I am getting

213
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,910
a deeper understanding.

214
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,720
I just want to stick with you,

215
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,270
and

216
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,030
to make more money

217
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,770
to buy more land

218
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,730
for our family,

219
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,860
especially Father.

220
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,990
Oh, right.

221
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,840
This is all the money I earned.

222
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,570
Here you are.

223
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,510
Let's keep the change

224
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,710
to save and to buy something for our baby.

225
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,240
Give the rest to Father.

226
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,240
You give it to him.

227
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,030
I concur with all your decisions.

228
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,550
Okay.

229
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,360
Xiu,

230
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,450
try the tub.

231
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,670
Sure.

232
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,840
I'll go boil some water.

233
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,240
Okay.

234
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,360
Don't stop me!

235
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,150
I must go!

236
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,370
What are you going to do? What can you do?

237
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,270
What will the villagers think of you?

238
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,390
Your own brother
brought those bandits here.

239
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,700
Maybe people think
you were in collusion with them.

240
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,960
I didn't collude with them.

241
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,110
I'm Si's older brother.

242
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,030
Can't I help his family?

243
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,410
Come and stop your father now.

244
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,860
He's going to visit Auntie Si

245
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,270
and plead for people's mercy
to release her and her children.

246
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:14,730
Father,

247
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,800
people are still angry now.

248
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,240
Do you think the militia

249
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
will do you a favor and release them?

250
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,070
That's right.

251
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,600
Si reaped what he sowed

252
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,840
and caused suffering
to his wife and children.

253
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,390
But I can't just lay back and watch

254
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,360
Si's wife and their children die.

255
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,390
I should at least
save a descendant of his, right?

256
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm his older brother!

257
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,510
Father,

258
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,200
we all know how upset you are.

259
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,870
Despite what Uncle Si did,

260
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,320
he was your own little brother.

261
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,650
But think about this...

262
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,730
This time, the bandits

263
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,560
killed many villagers, didn't they?

264
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,760
A number of living souls just vanished.

265
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,330
If Uncle Si hadn't
brought the bandits in,

266
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
those people
would've been safe and sound now.

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,360
They would be just like us,

268
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
getting ready to work in the fields.

269
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,270
Besides,

270
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,690
if it were me and Dajiao
who got injured or killed,

271
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,640
would you be saying these words?

272
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,520
I just want to beg them for mercy,

273
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,040
so they'd spare a son of Si's.

274
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
For God's sake, Si was my brother!

275
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,090
Father.

276
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,350
To tell you the truth,

277
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,220
Xiuxiu already set them free last night,

278
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,280
when the guys were drinking.

279
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,840
Is it true?

280
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,270
You think I'd lie to you?

281
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,070
Set them free?

282
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,270
Honey,

283
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,030
honestly speaking,

284
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,600
we've done all we can for Si.

285
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,550
Si,

286
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,390
if there's a next life,

287
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,080
you'd better straighten up.

288
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,790
Be a good person!

289
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,200
What?

290
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,520
They escaped?

291
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,930
How did that weak women and her sons

292
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,130
flee under your nose?

293
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,680
I already set up a pot of oil
before the theater stage!

294
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,600
Kejin,

295
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:58,930
you see,

296
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,670
Fei Wu and Shuanzi are looking for them.

297
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,290
Tell them not to

298
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,550
come back if they can't find those three!

299
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,790
Nothing can defy my will.

300
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,270
I must

301
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,870
make an example of them three

302
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,270
to warn the others

303
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,190
not to harm the villagers.

304
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,400
Go find them!

305
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,360
Xiuxiu!

306
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,670
Xiuxiu!

307
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:25,870
Xiuxiu!

308
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,150
Kebi,

309
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,320
what happened?

310
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
Go to the militia's hall now.

311
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Kejin has had Feng Si's wife,

312
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,610
who escaped, brought back.

313
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,390
What about the kids? Her two sons?

314
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,690
I only saw the younger one.

315
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,550
I don't know much other than that.

316
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,610
I'll go check it out.

317
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,570
I'm going with you.

318
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,550
Don't go!

319
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,910
It worries me when you run around.
Please stay.

320
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,710
Just stay put.

321
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,700
I'll come back and tell you
about what's going on.

322
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,470
It's going to be fine.

323
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,600
You stink!

324
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,560
Fei Wu, listen.

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,720
You're lucky to have caught her.

326
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,360
Or you'll be whipped!

327
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,510
Kejin,

328
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,970
I chased after them for 20 li

329
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,070
and even reached the Gu Village.

330
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,080
Do you know where they were hiding?

331
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,210
They were crammed in

332
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,030
next to pigs in a pigpen.

333
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,440
I almost didn't recognize them.

334
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,190
Did they tell you who released them?

335
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,190
They said they escaped on their own.

336
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,300
Where is Niwei?

337
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,470
Our people are hunting for him.

338
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,320
They said they somehow split up halfway.

339
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,030
Kejin, what to do with these two?

340
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,230
Tie up Feng Si's wife!

341
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,780
No food or water for her!

342
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,120
We'll punish them together

343
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
when her older son is found!

344
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,670
Get up!

345
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,150
Get up!

346
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,440
Behave!

347
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,570
Give my son back to me!

348
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,030
Mother!

349
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,630
-Give my son back to me!
-Hands off my mother!

350
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,270
Wait!

351
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,330
Let go of my mother!

352
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,270
Mother!

353
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,670
Kejin.

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,550
Dajiao.

355
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,870
Let go of my mother!

356
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:54,960
You came just in time.

357
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,050
Let go of my mother...

358
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,270
Second Uncle wants a word with us.
Come with me.

359
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,720
Kejin.

360
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,360
Can I

361
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,390
take the kid away?

362
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,650
Punish the adult

363
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,600
all you want,

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,330
but the kid is innocent.

365
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,270
Yeah.

366
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,360
That's right.

367
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
The kid needs food now,

368
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,840
or he'll starve to death, won't he?

369
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
Exactly.

370
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Help the kid!

371
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,390
Fine!

372
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,920
Let the kid go. Set him free.

373
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,360
Take that kid away right now.

374
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,820
Mother!

375
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,630
Give him to me.

376
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,340
Er!

377
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,880
Mother!

378
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,390
Er!

379
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
I'm deeply grateful

380
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,120
for your kindness.

381
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,030
Meiwei,

382
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,390
keep this in mind—

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,660
from now on,

384
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
Uncle Er and Auntie Er

385
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,390
are your father and mother.

386
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,830
Remember that!

387
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,390
Remember that!

388
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,150
Remember that!

389
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,400
Mother!

390
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,400
Mother!

391
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,790
Mother!

392
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,349
Meiwei!

393
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,109
Tie her up!

394
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,880
Mother!

395
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,510
Hey,

396
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,240
aren't you afraid

397
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,720
that Boss will kill you
for putting me down?

398
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,720
Boss sent me here.

399
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,000
He has a message for you.

400
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,040
The Ox Temple Village
is not to be messed with.

401
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,010
They have support inside and outside.

402
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,610
Don't screw with them again.

403
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,440
Boss also told you

404
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,770
to forget about

405
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
seeking revenge.

406
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,650
As a bandit...

407
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,110
I feel so humiliated.

408
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,830
Meiwei,

409
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,680
don't forget how well Xiuxiu treats you.

410
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,350
Meiwei, look.

411
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Isn't it a pretty bathtub? It's new.

412
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,030
You're the first user of it.

413
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,330
Xiuxiu doesn't mind the smell on you.

414
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,970
The odor has gone now that he's clean.

415
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,830
Right, Meiwei?

416
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,570
Kiddo.

417
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,070
Hot.

418
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,730
Got burned, didn't you?

419
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,620
This poor little thing.

420
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,110
Slowly.

421
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,650
Take your time.

422
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll get you a bowl of porridge.

423
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,570
Father.

424
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,420
Don't rush.

425
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,940
Where is Auntie Si?

426
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,830
Still locked up by your brother.

427
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,510
Did you and my brother

428
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,500
go to meet Second Uncle?

429
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,070
The trouble brought by the bandits

430
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,600
has made Second Uncle sick.

431
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,880
He has to be on bed rest now.

432
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,280
He recommended Kejin as the village chief.

433
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,270
The elders all gave a nod to it,

434
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,880
saying

435
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,400
that before
the official appointment file arrives,

436
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,130
Kejin will be the acting chief.

437
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
Go out with me

438
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,660
for a little discussion.

439
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,970
Mother,

440
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,510
we'll be out for a bit.

441
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,810
Enjoy the egg, Meiwei!

442
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,200
Delicious, huh?

443
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
Take your time.

444
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,620
This place will be my office.

445
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,780
Clean it up, guys!

446
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,830
Listen up!

447
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,070
From now on,

448
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,550
this place is not only where you live

449
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,000
and practice combat skills,

450
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
but also where

451
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,740
I conduct my duties

452
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,310
as the village chief.

453
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,270
So you'll be

454
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,310
a fair judge

455
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,640
presiding trials then.

456
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,920
My job is to redress any grievances

457
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,520
that the villagers may have.

458
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,200
Kejin!

459
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,000
Kejin!

460
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,410
Kejin...

461
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,820
Where is Niwei?

462
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,230
We couldn't find him.

463
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
You couldn't?

464
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,240
Kneel!

465
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,410
Take him to the hut.

466
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,550
What do you want?

467
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,820
To meet the village chief.

468
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,600
We'd like to file a petition.

469
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
I need to talk to the village chief.

470
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,040
Kejin!

471
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:39,960
Kejin!

472
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,200
What is it now?

473
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Let us in, please!

474
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,440
Kejin,

475
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,250
the villagers are asking you
to right a wrong.

476
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,110
Am I going to act as a fair judge so soon?

477
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,110
Chief!

478
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,000
No need for court formalities.

479
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,060
Line up in two rows.

480
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,470
Let the villagers in!

481
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,030
Let them in! Let them in!

482
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,690
Let them in!

483
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,200
Go ahead.

484
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,140
Chief, we have a petition.

485
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,040
Chief! Chief!

486
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,700
Who are filing a petition?

487
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:06,920
Xiu,

488
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,530
what are you doing here?

489
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,840
Who's having a complaint against whom?

490
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,000
Kejin,

491
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,590
we're here to plead for Auntie Si'.

492
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,760
We all think she should be released.

493
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,970
Yes. Release her.

494
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,030
Release her?

495
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,270
What did you all say in the first place?

496
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,640
Feng Si's family

497
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,200
brought bandits into the village

498
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,510
and subjected our folks to suffering.

499
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,880
How can Feng Si's wife be released?

500
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,550
Didn't you ask me

501
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,310
to set up a pot of oil

502
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,720
by the theater stage

503
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,090
to fry her and her sons?

504
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,000
Zhuzi's wife,

505
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,680
you suggested that too, right?

506
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,310
I didn't.

507
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,870
We didn't say that.

508
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,440
Chief Kejin, can I...

509
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,510
say something?

510
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,590
-Mother.
-Dajiao's mother.

511
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,550
Feng Si's wife is my sister-in-law.

512
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,920
Everyone knows we don't get along.

513
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Over these years,

514
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,350
she's eaten and drunk plenty at my home.

515
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,920
Now, you see,

516
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,720
Feng Si is dead.

517
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,070
He already paid a price for his acts.

518
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,240
Niwei has run away.

519
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,680
Only this woman and her younger son stay.

520
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
I've thought it through.

521
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,270
I choose to let the bygones be bygones.

522
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm over it now.

523
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,680
All the villagers are over it too.

524
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,750
It's all in the past.

525
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,820
All is over now.
Si's wife and her younger son

526
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,970
won't cause trouble

527
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
or harm us again.

528
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,180
Right. Well said.

529
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,720
Kejin,

530
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,830
humiliation is not to be
extended to parents.

531
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,790
Punishment is for the wrongdoers only.

532
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,440
Now,

533
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,440
Uncle Si is gone.

534
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,200
Auntie Si is nearly scared to death.

535
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,890
She wouldn't dare to do evil again.

536
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,870
I volunteer to sign an affidavit

537
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,920
to vouch for her.

538
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,030
I'll vouch for her too.

539
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,830
We'll all vouch for her.

540
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,070
Me as well. We're all ready to do so.

541
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,400
We volunteer to sign an affidavit for her.

542
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,110
It won't help with anything!

543
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,040
I don't care
if Feng Si's wife lives or dies.

544
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,510
She might not be the mastermind,

545
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,270
but for knowingly
withholding the information,

546
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,600
she cannot be pardoned.

547
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,350
Kejin!

548
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,030
We all feel the same way.

549
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,030
It's known to us that they did wrong.

550
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,640
But we've all agreed
not to pursue it further.

551
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,350
-Yes. We'll drop it.
-We won't pursue it further.

552
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,750
We believe you to be
a benevolent official.

553
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,250
Please take our advice.

554
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,030
Release her, Chief.

555
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,600
Release her.
We'll drop this matter forever.

556
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,000
You all share

557
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,550
the same opinion as Xiu, right?

558
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,920
Yes!

559
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,350
Fine.

560
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,160
This is my first day in office

561
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,830
as the chief of the village.

562
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,440
I shall grant

563
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,160
a general amnesty!

564
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,040
Release her!

565
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
How kind of you, Chief!

566
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,640
Thank you, Chief.

567
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,310
I...

568
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,270
I took refuge in the village

569
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,070
at the age of 19.

570
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,280
Upon my arrival,

571
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,510
I soon married into the Feng family.

572
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,790
My husband did

573
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,930
terrible things to the village.

574
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,760
He paid for it with his life.

575
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,510
My son's still too young.

576
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,830
Thank you all

577
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,830
for looking out for us

578
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,550
and for allowing me to raise my son here.

579
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,590
I should kowtow to all of you.

580
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,750
Don't do that! Get up!

581
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,400
Get up.

582
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,960
Get up, Si's wife.

583
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,510
Si's wife, listen to me.

584
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,790
You see,

585
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
everyone in the village treats you

586
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,550
with nothing but goodwill.

587
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,040
Don't be afraid.

588
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,690
You can start all over again

589
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,720
to build a good life
and to be a good person.

590
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,310
Besides, when Niwei comes back,
you must tell him

591
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,270
how nice the villagers are to your family.

592
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,040
Alright.

593
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,790
Stop it now. We wish you all the best.

594
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,110
Leave them to it, everyone.

595
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,710
Thank you.

596
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,590
It's all over now.

597
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,590
Put it behind you.

598
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,590
Let's go.

599
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,870
Thank you.

600
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,810
Let me know if you need anything.

601
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,270
Digging for wild vegetables seems easy,

602
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,470
but it's actually the most tiring work.

603
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,000
My back is hurting so bad.

604
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,960
Even if you spend an entire day on it,

605
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,680
you still can't feed
those six hungry mouths at your home.

606
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,480
Of course you'd feel exhausted.

607
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,690
Have some water.

608
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,830
No.

609
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,890
I need a rest.

610
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,850
What are you doing?

611
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,000
What's wrong?

612
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,360
No one else is around.

613
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,500
What's to fear?

614
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,010
Is it your plan to live in this shed?

615
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,280
Yes.

616
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,460
I'll stay till the autumn harvest.

617
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
We'll get married and go home then.

618
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,170
You've said that a million times.

619
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,030
Tietou, braid my hair. Braid my hair!

620
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,680
-What's going on?
-Leave! Go play!

621
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,300
Do you hear me?

622
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,270
G-Go play somewhere else!

623
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,400
Stop yelling at her!

624
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,060
Look what a poor thing she is.

625
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,720
Silly Tiao.

626
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,090
Let me braid your hair, okay?

627
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,650
I'll braid your hair.

628
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,670
You have such good hair, Silly Tiao.

629
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,230
I'm putting it into braids.

630
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,190
Look.

631
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,850
Time to wear a flower.

632
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,350
You look so pretty with this flower on.

633
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,940
Silly Tiao is wearing flowers,

634
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,520
like a bride!

635
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,210
Silly Tiao,

636
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,390
turn around so I can see you.

637
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,780
Don't be afraid, Silly Tiao!

638
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,490
Look.

639
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,240
I'm beating him up.

640
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,160
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

641
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,070
W-Where are you going?

642
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,670
It's getting late. I should go home now.

643
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,700
It's still early.

644
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,270
Stay with me.

645
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,880
Back to your shed, good boy.

646
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,680
Let's go, Silly Tiao.

647
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,880
Braids, Miss!

648
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,840
What braids?

649
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,550
Don't come again,

650
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,080
or I'll cut off your braids!

651
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,690
This way, Silly Tiao.

652
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,080
She's too silly
to tell the right direction.

653
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,680
Let's go!

654
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,960
You're finally back.

655
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,720
Go make a fire.

656
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,270
Okay.

657
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,560
Mother.

658
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,510
How are you?

659
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,790
I'm fine.

660
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,450
I'll make you some porridge.

661
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,110
Okay.

662
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,130
I went digging for wild vegetables.

663
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,200
Let me get you some.

664
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,920
What do you think you're doing?

665
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,730
Did I allow you to eat it?

666
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,550
Yinzi,

667
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,710
don't shout at them.

668
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,830
When you were out,

669
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,000
they got so hungry
that they started eating soil.

670
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,610
I'm eager for a bite too.

671
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,320
May I?

672
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,510
Eat it.

673
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,170
I'll dig for more when it runs out.

674
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,430
Take your time.

675
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,030
Father,

676
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,350
we can call it a day

677
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,570
when the watering is finished.

678
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,330
Xiuxiu is pregnant now.

679
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
There will be one more mouth to feed.

680
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,570
I've made up my mind

681
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,430
to clear more land.

682
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,630
Son,

683
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,850
working for others
is better than clearing new land.

684
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,440
This is not much of a good year.

685
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,790
I would've cleared new land
if conditions permitted, don't you think?

686
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,250
I'm not going to find a job.

687
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,770
I'll stick with you, Mother

688
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,770
and Xiuxiu.

689
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,700
I believe I can find

690
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,440
new land to cultivate in the village.

691
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,030
I'll go farther

692
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,450
and search.

693
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,170
Look,

694
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
the Beginning of Summer is approaching.

695
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,270
But up till now,

696
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,030
there hasn't been a drop of rain.

697
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,640
Isn't it a disaster?

698
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,880
As an old saying goes,

699
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,670
"when it doesn't rain
at the Beginning of Summer,

700
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,700
plows and rakes are hung
as they're of no use.

701
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,090
Without water for the grain,

702
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,890
wheat fields will turn barren."

703
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,900
We need to pray for rain.

704
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,260
Listen,

705
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,270
let's go pray for rain tomorrow.

706
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,030
Gather as many people as you can.

707
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,590
Got it.

708
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,240
Grandpa Ox above us,

709
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,320
today, all the residents

710
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,030
of our village are here

711
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,400
to worship you.

712
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,110
We cordially implore Grandpa Ox

713
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,550
to invite

714
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
the four Dragon Kings over

715
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,530
from the east, west, south and north seas

716
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,110
to this very place.

717
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,590
Let there be wind

718
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,590
and rain!

719
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,240
Kneel.

720
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,110
Go east, clouds.

721
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,920
Bring gales to us.

722
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,110
Go north, clouds.

723
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Bring heavy rainfalls to us.

724
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,270
Go south, clouds.

725
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,440
Bring water to the river.

726
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,440
Go west, clouds.

727
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,340
Bring rain to this land.

728
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,050
May raindrops nourish the land

729
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,110
to ensure bountiful harvests.

730
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,260
May raindrops reach every corner

731
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,030
to relieve us from adversities.

732
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,070
May raindrops nourish the land
to ensure bountiful harvests.

733
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,030
May raindrops reach every corner
to relieve us from adversities.

734
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,030
Dragon Kings, we wish for

735
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,060
mountain-shrouding rainfalls.

736
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,880
All will be pleased

737
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,240
to see pouring rain!

738
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,350
Dragon Kings, we wish for
mountain-shrouding rainfalls.

739
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,350
All will be pleased to see pouring rain!

740
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,720
Humpback Guo!

741
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,930
Why was your business closed for days?

742
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,980
You didn't deliver goods to me either.

743
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,350
I was waiting at the doorstep every day

744
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,680
and getting impatient.

745
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,850
Sorry.

746
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,040
My wife's old illness flared up again,

747
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,790
so I took her downtown to the doctor's.

748
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,270
I wasn't back until just now.

749
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,960
How is she?

750
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,510
Has she got well yet?

751
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,450
She was born

752
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,800
with a consumptive disease.

753
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,060
There's no cure for it.

754
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,070
I just hope

755
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,690
she'd suffer less.

756
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,170
Because you didn't deliver goods to me,

757
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,330
I was really upset.

758
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,510
But seeing how much
you care about your wife,

759
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,440
I'm not mad at you anymore.

760
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,850
You also brought help to the village.

761
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,250
I'll always remember your contributions.

762
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,160
Here's an egg

763
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,680
for the Beginning of Summer.

764
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,400
Take it as a gift.

765
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
I'll save one for myself too.

766
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,030
Get a move on.

767
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,670
Reveal the items you brought me.

768
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,470
I'll show you some mercy
when I negotiate the price.

769
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,530
Thank you so much for that, Miss Susu.

770
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,650
I did bring quite a lot of novel items.

771
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,880
Take your pick.

772
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,980
Get me a chair.

773
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,640
I'll make picks while seated.

774
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,750
Sister-in-law,

775
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,600
I'm back.

776
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,610
Come here.

777
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,510
Sister-in-law,

778
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,510
let me show you

779
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,680
the novel items

780
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,210
I bought from Humpback Guo.

781
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,980
This is called a parasol.

782
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,240
And these...

783
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,740
Humpback Guo said foreign women

784
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,470
wear such long gloves
when they use parasols.

785
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,130
These are called lace gloves.

786
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,240
And this one, Sister-in-law,

787
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,880
is a hand-held mirror for the face

788
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,110
and also the hair at the back.

789
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,110
They're all from overseas.

790
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,720
Here comes the funniest one.

791
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,350
It's a hand-held telescope.

792
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,110
Look through this piece of glass,

793
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,110
and you'll see things far, far away.

794
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,880
Sister-in-law,

795
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,280
you look far away from me.

796
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
And now you're getting closer.

797
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,520
You're squandering money
on useless stuff,

798
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,030
having no idea of
how high our daily expenses are.

799
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,230
How are they useless?

800
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,030
This is a parasol

801
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,240
for shade.

802
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,970
I'll hold it for you
when you go collect rent,

803
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,660
so you won't get sunburned.

804
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,540
These novel items sold by Humpback Guo

805
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,510
were really expensive.

806
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,720
But I haggled so hard

807
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,940
that he nearly cried.

808
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,750
Buyers are seldom able to

809
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,000
to take advantage of sellers.

810
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,199
You think you can outsmart him in a deal?

811
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,030
Did Humpback Guo bring you

812
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,190
any letters from Wendian?

813
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,449
Dajiao was eager to go home,
so they hurried back

814
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,050
without pausing at the town.

815
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,739
What about the newspaper I asked for?

816
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,150
I forgot about it.

817
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,929
I'll go get it now.

818
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,280
Never mind.

819
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,780
It's not that urgent.

820
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,610
Buy it next time when you see him.

821
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,150
Sit. I have something important to say.

822
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,000
Susu,

823
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,360
in the future,

824
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,449
it'll be your duty
to manage the household.

825
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,170
You can't childish anymore.

826
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,679
Why should I run the household?

827
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,679
Aren't you doing a good job of it now?

828
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,179
I've decided

829
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,630
to start training you.

830
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,190
Wendian is working in town.

831
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,590
Though he's a trainee teacher now,

832
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,880
I know

833
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,090
he'll become an official someday.

834
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,480
You'll have to be the one
managing the household, right?

835
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,640
I've made a vow
before the ancestral tablets

836
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,440
to hand over the responsibility
to you two one day.

837
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,230
Here are two ledgers.

838
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,840
One is for the shops.

839
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,590
The other one for the rent.

840
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,230
Study them carefully.

841
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,400
Back then, I went through them many times

842
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,960
before getting the gist.

843
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,430
Browse through them now.

844
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,600
I've made some soup

845
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,000
with red dates and beans for you
in the kitchen.

846
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,590
I'll go check on it. If it's done,

847
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,450
I'll have Xiaoqin bring you some.

848
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,560
Sister-in-law,

849
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,210
you're being really nice to me now.

850
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,280
You not only spare me
from herbal medicine,

851
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,200
but also often serve me
my favorite dishes.

852
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
I don't want to leave now.

853
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,090
Where are you leaving for?

854
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,290
This is your home. Where else can you be?

855
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,120
Sister-in-law,

856
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,670
Wendian and I are not
meant to be a couple.

857
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,720
You already married him.
Why that nonsense?

858
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,360
I know

859
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,430
I didn't handle things well before.

860
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,190
I just fretted.

861
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,690
I couldn't wait to see you
bear children for the Fei family.

862
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,010
But I've thought it through now.

863
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,110
That will happen sooner or later.

864
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,590
So, I'm not rushing it anymore.

865
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,280
As for you,

866
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
just live here without worries

867
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,110
and wait for Wendian to come back.

868
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,110
Let nature

869
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,440
take its course.

870
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,110
Who can tell what the future holds?

871
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
I know what to do

872
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,170
without you saying anything.

873
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,240
You didn't leave me alone

874
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,800
when the bandits came at me.

875
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,130
That made me realize

876
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
you're a reliable person by my side.

877
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,110
I must treat you well.

878
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,210
Sister-in-law,

879
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,750
I'll treat you well too.

880
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,150
You did make a real effort to dig up

881
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,480
these salvia miltiorrhiza seedlings.

882
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,400
Mother,

883
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,240
we got 30 cents for selling
the previous batch of salvia miltiorrhiza.

884
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,320
I just want to figure out how it grows.

885
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,860
You do have a strong will.

886
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,720
But don't wear yourself out.

887
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,790
I'm taking good care of myself.

888
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,250
Mother, have you noticed?

889
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,780
Since the bandits left,

890
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,630
the villagers have worked much harder
than before.

891
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,940
They're all trying to
forge a promising future.

892
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,350
Sounds true.

893
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,650
You're right.

894
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,690
Who wouldn't be worried
after what happened?

895
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,770
My goodness.

896
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,590
Those bandits planned for a slaughter.

897
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,850
We were given a second chance at life
when we escaped death.

898
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,920
That's what motivates me

899
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,060
to figure out how this plant grows

900
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,420
as soon as possible.

901
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Good.

902
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,150
Ma'am!

903
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,400
Ma'am!

904
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,590
Bad news!

905
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,270
Bad news!

906
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,960
What's up?

907
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,240
Glutton Fei's hungry son

908
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,360
ate Datura plants by mistake.

909
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,290
He was poisoned.

910
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,440
Now, his eyes are rolling back.
Go check on him!

911
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,230
Let's go!

912
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,130
Go!

913
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,670
How did it happen?

914
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,030
What's wrong?

915
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,590
How did this happen?

916
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,070
I was digging for wild vegetables
with them.

917
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,400
I turned my back for a second
and he just...

918
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,590
My son! My son!

919
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,070
Please don't die.

920
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,780
Let me help!

921
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,910
What am I supposed to do if you die, Son?

922
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,280
Datura plants are highly toxic.

923
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,010
Even oxen and sheep avoid them.

924
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,020
What's going on?

925
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,120
My little brother!

926
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,430
My brother...

927
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,620
Has anyone sent for a doctor yet?

928
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,790
Zhuzi is on it.

929
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,120
H-Have you patted his back

930
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,400
with his head facing down?

931
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,030
Right!

932
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,800
Do it now!

933
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:47,730
Pat!

934
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,760
Pat his back!

935
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,110
Keep patting!

936
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,100
He's spitting it out.

937
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,500
He's spitting it all out.

938
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,440
You'll be fine.

939
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,410
My son!

940
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,650
H-How could you put
random berries in your mouth?

941
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,090
I'm going to beat you up!

942
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,240
You silly boy!

943
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,550
Make way for the doctor.

944
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,610
Let me check on him.

945
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,840
His hand.

946
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,300
I'll feel his pulse.

947
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,270
How is he?

948
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,040
How is he?

949
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,030
Though

950
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,290
the boy has come to,

951
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
he still needs to take an emetic

952
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,550
since the toxins have stayed
too long in his system.

953
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,400
Datura plants' toxins

954
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,080
kick in within a short time.

955
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,630
Luckily,
the boy didn't eat too many of them.

956
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,760
If he had,

957
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,020
he would've been killed within a moment.

958
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,210
Punishment awaits you at home!

959
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,030
Take the boy home
and take good care of him!

960
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,090
Stop spanking him.

961
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,750
Those

962
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,150
weak legs of theirs

963
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,350
can't support them in the fields.

964
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,590
Wait, young ladies.

965
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,650
What are you doing?

966
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,030
We can't afford the medical fee.

967
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,910
Could you put it on our tab?

968
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,570
We'll pay up next time
when you treat our mother.

969
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,490
I won't charge for
your brother's treatment.

970
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,520
Oh, right.

971
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,550
Take this.

972
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,470
It is

973
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,890
an emetic.

974
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,990
Hurry back home

975
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,670
and feed it to your brother.

976
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,030
Just go home. Go.

977
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,530
Alright. Go home now.

978
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
Off you go.

979
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,970
Bring the medicine to your brother.

980
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,700
Go home now. Go.

981
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,130
Bring the medicine home.

982
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,960
How is this plant

983
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,510
a potent drug?

984
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,910
The leaves are already a menace.

985
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,300
The Datura flowers

986
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,380
and berries are even

987
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,110
more toxic.

988
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,360
But on the other hand,

989
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,510
Datura is also a medicinal herb.

990
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,630
It relieves pain

991
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,500
and stops spasms.

992
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,130
However,

993
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,400
the dosage must be precisely controlled.

994
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,200
Fortunately,

995
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,030
the boy didn't take in much.

996
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,360
Alright. I'll leave it to you.

997
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
I'm heading back.

998
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,060
I have patients

999
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,790
to attend to.

1000
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,400
I know

1001
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,170
it's known as "mountain nightshade."

1002
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,010
Another poisonous plant
called "sheep's bane"

1003
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,590
is commonly seen in this area.

1004
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,390
Its blossoms are really pretty.

1005
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Are you hungry?

1006
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,590
Xiu!

1007
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,190
Come here!

1008
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,630
I'll show you something.

1009
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,360
What is it?

1010
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Just come with me.

1011
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,870
Look at this!

1012
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,070
It's soil.

1013
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,360
I cleared this land

1014
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,590
all by myself.

1015
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,070
Xiu,

1016
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,820
this small land has real potential.

1017
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,840
There are many rocks underneath.

1018
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,670
I almost gave up at first.

1019
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,060
But then I discovered

1020
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,100
soil in the cracks among the rocks.

1021
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,030
Crops can grow where there is soil.

1022
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,930
I've got it all planned out.

1023
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,630
I'll transfer good soil
from the mountain foot to this land.

1024
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,210
As long as the seeds can sprout,

1025
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:33,870
their roots

1026
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
will find their way into the ground.

1027
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
I can fix a small patch

1028
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,000
in three days.

1029
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,710
A large one in ten days.

1030
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,190
I've checked. On this Turtle Hill,

1031
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,440
I can clear about two mu of land.

1032
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,170
I don't hate it for being small.

1033
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,180
Dajiao,

1034
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,630
I just think
it's too heavy a workload on you.

1035
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,730
Not at all.

1036
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,150
Let's eat.

1037
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,630
Slow down.

1038
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,630
Today,

1039
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,280
Mother and I

1040
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,030
dug for wild vegetables.

1041
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,020
She told me the amount of wild vegetables
this year was less than before.

1042
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,480
In last spring, one could find enough
to feed an entire family.

1043
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,000
Out of hunger, Yinzi's little brother ate

1044
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,860
the toxic "mountain nightshade"
by mistake.

1045
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,340
He nearly lost his life.

1046
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,670
It's a bad year.

1047
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,800
Yinzi's family is having
an even tougher time.

1048
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,710
All our neighbors

1049
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,070
are trying their best
to make a decent living.

1050
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,730
Why is everything
running counter to our ideals?

1051
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,550
If grains can't grow in this land,

1052
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,810
what are we going to do?

1053
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,030
We might as well grow herbs

1054
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,400
and sell them for money.

1055
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,880
Herbs?

1056
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,070
Yes.

1057
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,070
Mother took me to dig for herbs last time.

1058
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,150
You know that.

1059
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,490
We got 30 cents for selling those.

1060
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,880
It's a herb called salvia miltiorrhiza.

1061
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,140
Salvia miltiorrhiza?

1062
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,510
Does it grow from the ground?

1063
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,230
Yes.

1064
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,630
Then let's start with clearing this field.
