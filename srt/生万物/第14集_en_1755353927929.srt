[This Thriving Land]

2
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,710
Mrs. Fei arrives.

4
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
Wait here.

5
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,840
Brother Xuerui plans to sell

6
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,730
the 30 mu of good land at East Ridge

7
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,590
and asked me to find a buyer.

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,150
These days

9
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
I've approached some wealthy households

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
and fortunately Mrs. Fei has already shown
interest in this land.

11
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,480
Uncle Xueshi,

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,050
there's no outsider here,

13
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,810
so let's skip the formalities.

14
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,030
All right.

15
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,000
Everyone knows that Village Chief Xuerui's

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,950
30 mu of land at East Ridge

17
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,960
is not some very good land.

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,680
The ridge is too high and is always dry.

19
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,240
And I'm not as you said,

20
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,930
being interested in this land
from the beginning.

21
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,840
I'm buying it because it's adjacent to

22
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,400
my family's land down there.

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
I'm thinking after acquiring it,

24
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,760
in the future,

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,450
I can rent it to tenants,

26
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,000
which would be easier to manage.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,829
Yes.

28
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,890
Most importantly,

29
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,260
I've always respected

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,040
the Village Chief's character.

31
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Over these years,

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,660
he has shown much care for the Fei family.

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,150
I'm here to help in his time of need,

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,080
not to compete with others.

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,610
I've come up with a price.

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,920
18 silver coins per mu.

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,710
This price

38
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,350
is not low, is it?

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,970
No, it's not.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,829
Indeed, it's not low at all.

41
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier,

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
and you're still eating here?

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,820
Didn't you go to the provincial capital?

44
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,130
How could I tell you?

45
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,910
Did you sell it? Is it done?

46
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,710
They're drafting the contract.

47
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,190
Where are you going, Father?

48
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,180
What? That stingy old miser
is finally willing to cough up some money?

49
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,910
Those 30 mu of land at East Ridge

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,079
isn't my best land, to be honest.

51
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,680
The 14 mu of land west of our village

52
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,170
is recognized by everyone as good land.

53
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,940
Someone once offered 25 per mu,

54
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,520
and I didn't even agree.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,430
Now,

56
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,920
I'd rather sell at 18 per mu

57
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,740
to let you have first choice.

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,110
I appreciate your kindness.

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,070
I'm not a greedy person.

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,270
As I said,

61
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,390
I'm here to help in an emergency.

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,520
These 480 silver coins,

63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,900
I believe,

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
are fair to

65
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,470
both you and me.

66
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,000
After all, you are Susu's Second Uncle.

67
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,649
That land in the west village

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,970
is indeed good land.

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,310
Allow me to give you some advice,

70
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,770
just keep it for yourself.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,830
Even if it's not for your descendants,

72
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,090
think about your own future livelihood.

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,960
If this money isn't enough
to settle the matter,

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,230
you can borrow more.

75
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,170
Thank you for your kind words, Madam Fei,

76
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,520
we'll discuss future matters later.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,240
All right.

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,390
Let's draw up the contract?

79
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,740
Draw up the contract.

80
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,690
The seller,

81
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,670
Ning Xuerui,

82
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,690
due to urgent need of money,

83
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,120
hereby sells a section of ancestral land
at East Ridge.

84
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,040
A total of 30.13 mu of land.

85
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,090
The property

86
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,230
borders Mrs. Fei to the east
and Feng Jiacong to the west,

87
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,750
Ning Xuewu to the south
and the road to the north,

88
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,950
extending from the heavens above
to the underworld below.

89
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,930
With all six boundaries clearly defined

90
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,380
and access rights unchanged,

91
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,270
the property is hereby
sold and transferred to Mrs. Fei.

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,560
Wait! Wait! Wait!

93
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,440
How are we already drawing up the deed?

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,570
Second Brother, how can this land be sold?

95
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,159
Uncle Ning.

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,850
What do you mean by this?

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
The contract is well written,

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,430
and the concerned party is right here.

99
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,750
Isn't it inappropriate

100
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,080
to disrupt us like this?

101
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,620
Second Brother, tell them

102
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,470
if I'm right to stop this.

103
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,250
Why don't you talk?

104
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,880
Let me ask you again,

105
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,750
why didn't you ask me first
before selling the land?

106
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,620
You always push the price down so low
when buying land,

107
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,000
so Xuerui had to find someone else
to sell it.

108
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,520
There is nothing wrong with that,

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,010
right?

110
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,750
Besides, he needs money right now.

111
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,080
This is Ning family business.
Why are you getting involved?

112
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,470
I need to discuss this
with my Second Brother first.

113
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,610
Second Brother.

114
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,700
Wasn't this land acquired by
our grandfather?

115
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,050
Before grandfather died,

116
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,000
when we split the family and the land,

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
what did he say?

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,560
If you won't say it,

119
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,120
I'll say it for you.

120
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,930
Grandfather said,

121
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,070
if we want to prosper,

122
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
once land comes into the Ning family,

123
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,480
it must never be owned by another family.

124
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,840
Once Ning family land changes ownership,

125
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,590
the fortune and spiritual essence

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,760
built up over generations

127
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,200
will be ruined by someone's hands.

128
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,730
Everyone present here

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,180
and those outside,

130
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,190
listen carefully!

131
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,950
In this Ox Temple,

132
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,600
the Ning family's land,

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,050
can't take another surname!

134
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,960
You may all leave now.

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,980
Everyone, go home.

136
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,950
Well, if that's the case,

137
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,220
Uncle Xuerui,

138
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,830
you and your son

139
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,170
should just pray for some good luck.

140
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,130
Instead of selling land here,

141
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,720
you'd better go to your ancestral hall
and burn some incense for your ancestors.

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,409
Madam of the Fei family.

143
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:55,980
Qing.

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,930
Let's go back.

145
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,360
You...

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
Brother!

147
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,850
If I don't sell the land,

148
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,440
how can I save my son?

149
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,330
Come, Xueshi.

150
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,520
Draw up the contract for us brothers.

151
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,380
I'll take Second Brother's land.

152
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,390
Also at 18 per mu?

153
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,970
How could that be possible?

154
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,460
Then 30 per mu?

155
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,830
I'm watching over this land
for the Ning family for my grandfather.

156
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,250
By rights,
I shouldn't give you any money.

157
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,600
Considering you need money urgently,

158
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,659
I'll put up with it.

159
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,750
I'll take it at 10 per mu.

160
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,059
This...

161
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,980
How can I write the contract?

162
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,810
Just write it as I said.

163
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,220
Second Brother,

164
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,610
say something.

165
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,420
My Cousin,

166
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,230
just go ahead.

167
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,910
Okay.

168
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,580
10 per mu?

169
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,250
Then I can buy 40 of it.

170
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,000
No,4 mu.

171
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,130
4 mu.

172
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,720
Well then,

173
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,100
I'll buy 4 mu too.

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,720
Sell 4 mu to me?

175
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,410
You want to buy land too?

176
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,690
Do you deserve it?

177
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,450
Are you surnamed Ning?

178
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,210
If your surname is Ning,

179
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,290
I might consider selling you one mu.

180
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,790
Second Uncle.

181
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,270
Second Uncle,
Susu and I'll buy your land.

182
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm not a Ning.

183
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,800
Xiuxiu is a Ning.

184
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,980
Xiuxiu is a Ning, so she can buy it!

185
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,270
Second Uncle.

186
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
I know

187
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,030
you've always respected
family guidance.

188
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,120
I also know

189
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,190
you always see taking losses as blessings.

190
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,920
You always believe
everyone has a good heart.

191
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,030
But some people,

192
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,970
they'll do anything

193
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,270
for a piece of land.

194
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,030
I just overheard.

195
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,180
Isn't this land

196
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
only supposed to be sold to
the Ning family?

197
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,180
Then Susu and I will buy it.

198
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,520
We'll pay right now,

199
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,370
and you can use the money
to settle things instantly.

200
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:26,890
Father.

201
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,070
Give me the money,

202
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,530
I'll help you buy the land.

203
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,750
That's great!

204
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,180
I'll wait for your news.

205
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,630
I'll draw up a contract for you.

206
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,410
Second Uncle, I have money.

207
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,410
I'll buy your land at 18 per mu.

208
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,790
I want to buy 30 mu from you.

209
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,170
My Sister-in-law said
the seller in the contract

210
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,050
should be in the name of Ning Susu.

211
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,340
What are you doing?

212
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,890
These two are daughters
who married out of the Ning family,

213
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,020
so they don't count!

214
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,810
It counts if it's me buying, right?

215
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,480
Brother?

216
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,260
Father.

217
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,800
Am I, Ning Kejin, not part of
the Ning family?

218
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,730
It counts if it's me buying, right?

219
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,750
How could you be like this?

220
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,490
My two sisters just wanted to help
Second Uncle

221
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,030
raise money to save Kebi,

222
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,710
how could you say such things?

223
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,010
Xiu.

224
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,990
Tomorrow we'll go to town to get
the red deed.

225
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,240
You three little brats,

226
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,570
are you trying to upset your father?

227
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,270
When you were stealing Mrs. Fei's land,

228
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,390
why did you forget I was your daughter?

229
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,100
You're the one
who married me into the Fei family.

230
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,520
If you really take
my Sister-in-law's land,

231
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,790
how am I supposed to
live with the Fei family?

232
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm pregnant now,

233
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,980
you're this child's grandfather,

234
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,100
and I'm a Fei family's daughter-in-law!

235
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,160
Fellow villagers,

236
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,780
don't you all want to buy land?

237
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,680
After I, Ning Kejin,
have made my purchase,

238
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,630
just come to me

239
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,050
and I'll sell it to you right here.

240
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,440
Great!

241
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,240
I want 2 mu of land.

242
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
I'll buy 2 mu.

243
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,200
Raising children really brings nothing
but trouble.

244
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,670
It's truly karma.

245
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,520
Sister-in-law,

246
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,760
you should have seen

247
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,230
that my father became so livid,

248
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,040
and he finally stormed off all huffed up.

249
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm just worried about you.

250
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
You ran all the way here,

251
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,470
which might hurt yourself.

252
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,150
You're in a delicate condition now.

253
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,720
You can't risk anything.

254
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,180
I'm fine, Sister-in-law.

255
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,560
To be honest with you,

256
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,850
standing up for you
made me feel better too,

257
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,000
like I was relieving my own frustrations.

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,150
I farted several times on the way back,

259
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,680
and I don't feel
as uncomfortable as before.

260
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,520
My belly isn't even tough anymore.

261
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,780
You need to be careful.

262
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,430
Don't you pat it too hard to lose it.

263
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,860
Are you tired?

264
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,360
Do you want to lie down for a while?

265
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,660
I'd like some tea first.

266
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,180
Sure.

267
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,470
I've made chicken soup for you.

268
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,370
Have a few bowls tonight.

269
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,910
You're the Fei family's hero now.

270
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,340
Sister-in-law,
I'll pass on the chicken soup,

271
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,810
I've been feeling so inconvenient
moving around lately,

272
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,520
and even breathing is difficult.

273
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,920
I think I've really gained weight.

274
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,720
I won't eat anything before bed.

275
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,200
No way.

276
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,920
You still need to eat properly.

277
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,050
Even if you don't eat,
the baby still needs nourishment.

278
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,500
If you don't want chicken soup,

279
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
I got some brown sugar
from Humpback Guo today,

280
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,250
I'll make you some eggs boiled in
brown sugar water tonight.

281
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,050
Just have some before you sleep?

282
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,660
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

283
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,130
Sister-in-law,

284
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,560
do you think
my Father will go home and cry?

285
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,520
That land wasn't even his to begin with.

286
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,980
He hasn't lost anything,
what's there to cry about?

287
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
What I mean is,

288
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,720
my brother, Xiuxiu and I
all stood against him,

289
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,360
he's really lost face this time.

290
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,630
Your father's pride

291
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,560
has always been tied to that land.

292
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,510
If you ask me,

293
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,100
what you siblings did today was right.

294
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,670
Even if God comes to judge this case,

295
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,870
you could justify it.

296
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,630
Sister-in-law,
you're being so good to me now.

297
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,490
Well, not only are you expecting,

298
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,940
but you've also made such a contribution
to the Fei family today,

299
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
being good to you is what I should do.

300
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,640
Father.

301
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,010
Is that piece of land

302
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,350
the one at the west end of the village?

303
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,530
How much per mu? How many mu?

304
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,730
Father, don't worry,

305
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,090
Second Uncle's own money
plus the money from selling the land

306
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,490
is enough to settle the matter.

307
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,890
Yours has been returned.

308
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,170
Returned?

309
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,190
What do you mean?

310
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,240
It's been returned?

311
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,630
Then the land? Where's the land deed?

312
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,120
Father,

313
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,580
we should leave them some land
to make a living.

314
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,360
Dajiao and I both think
our family has enough for a livelihood,

315
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,620
and we don't lack land,

316
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,120
so I didn't take it.

317
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,280
You decided it for me?

318
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,520
Silly girl, has your head

319
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,410
been butted by a cow or something?

320
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
I gave you money to buy land!

321
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,080
But you returned it completely untouched!

322
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,340
To put it bluntly,
your Second Uncle's land

323
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,940
can be sold to anyone anyway!

324
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
Are you trying to piss me off?

325
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,510
What's wrong?

326
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,510
What's wrong? I asked her to buy land,

327
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,620
but she not only didn't buy any,

328
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,310
she brought the money back to me!

329
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:57,790
You!

330
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,190
I'm going to talk to him!

331
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,430
-Father.
-Father, you...

332
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,190
Don't go,

333
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,470
there's no land left.

334
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,360
They've sold

335
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,510
what they wanted to sell,

336
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,170
and they're keeping the rest.

337
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,000
You wastrels!

338
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,000
Father,

339
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,670
Second Uncle isn't selling land
for a living.

340
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,950
So he's reluctant to sell this land.

341
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,890
Although the villagers say
they're helping,

342
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,390
no matter which piece of land is bought,

343
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,890
it's like taking a piece of
Second Uncle's heart.

344
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,120
We both think we shouldn't

345
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,720
act against our conscience.

346
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,410
Both of them are right.

347
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,270
If you bought this land,

348
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,390
wouldn't it be like farming Tietou's land,

349
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,870
making you feel uneasy?

350
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,920
Sister-in-law,

351
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,840
whose heart are you trying to take?

352
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,640
Yours!

353
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,540
Stop interrupting, go back to your work.

354
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,630
You two go home and rest.

355
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,960
Why take mine?

356
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,930
Oh heavens,

357
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,680
oh Earth,

358
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,080
the land is gone!

359
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,150
The land is gone again!

360
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,670
My heart has been taken!

361
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,240
I'm really regretting it now.

362
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,000
Our father wants that land too badly.

363
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,790
I understand my father.

364
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,230
Our family has 18 mu of land.

365
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,960
Father dreams of rounding it up to 20 mu.

366
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,510
I've been thinking about this too.

367
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,050
I'll look around to see

368
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,230
where I can clear about 2 mu of land,

369
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,510
make it 20 mu and fulfill father's dream.

370
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,510
I've got plenty of strength anyway.

371
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,680
Your arm hasn't fully healed yet.

372
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,100
Wait until your arm is recovered.

373
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,910
It's fine.

374
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,790
Get to bed early tonight.

375
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,360
We'll need to plant peanuts
for Auntie Tietou tomorrow.

376
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,280
Sleep early.

377
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,610
Sister-in-law.

378
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,670
Have some water and take a break.

379
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,230
Dajiao, Xiuxiu.

380
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,970
Stop working.
Have some water and rest a bit.

381
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm not thirsty.

382
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,320
I'll drink after I finish this row.

383
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,120
Xiu.

384
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,750
Come here, take a break.

385
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,160
Go ahead.

386
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,980
Go rest a bit.

387
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,910
Have some water.

388
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,920
Go on. What's wrong?  Hurry up.

389
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,390
These 13 mu of land are really good.

390
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,349
Dajiao's Father said

391
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,780
he plowed it deeply three times,

392
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,930
and turned over all the barren soil,

393
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,880
so we're sure to harvest good crops.

394
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,510
Yes.

395
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,680
These few mu of peanuts

396
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,940
will produce more than ten liters of oil,

397
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,470
which is really good.

398
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,130
After the autumn harvest,
and once we pay the rent,

399
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,180
I reckon we'll still have some surplus.

400
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,910
Things are finally looking up.

401
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,160
Later on,

402
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,230
you can help Tietou marry Yinzi,

403
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,140
who is so capable,

404
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,770
everyone praises her.

405
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,140
You'll just be enjoying the good life.

406
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Me? I wouldn't dare to think

407
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,910
I could be as fortunate as your parents.

408
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,680
My fate isn't that good.

409
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,420
Sister-in-law.

410
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,920
I heard your husband wasn't feeling well.

411
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,950
How is he these days? Any better?

412
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,280
He doesn't have a good mood.

413
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,840
Yesterday, they came back empty-handed
from buying the land.

414
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,040
He feels frustrated.

415
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,780
Have some more.

416
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,580
No more for me.

417
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,170
Here comes his Second Uncle.

418
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,640
Speak of the devil, look who's here.

419
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Second Uncle.

420
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,610
You helped us plow this land deeply.

421
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,070
Thank you for your hard work.

422
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,460
After the autumn harvest,

423
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,250
I'll grind the wheat and make dumplings,

424
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,220
and have Tietou bring them to you.

425
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,440
Eating your dumplings?

426
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,410
Who knows when that'll happen?

427
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,600
I might have already

428
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,410
starved to death by then!

429
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,050
Then when my Tietou comes back,

430
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,320
I'll let him buy some sweet potato liquor
to drink with you.

431
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,920
Well, skip the drink.

432
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,000
I appreciate the gesture,

433
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,730
but you need to fix that gap later.

434
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,590
It looks terrible with those jagged edges.

435
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,940
I will fix it! I will!

436
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,050
My Father

437
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,710
has such a kind heart.

438
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,620
He is kind indeed,

439
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,640
but that mouth of his ruins everything.

440
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,690
Dajiao.

441
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,880
Terrible news!

442
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,060
What's wrong, Zhuzi?

443
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,060
You asked me to get Tietou's messenger,
and he's back.

444
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,680
He says the rich Pan family,
where Tietou is labouring for,

445
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,920
was attacked by the bandits.

446
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,240
They captured several farmhands,

447
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,920
and they still haven't found them yet.

448
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,720
There's more.

449
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,980
What is it? Tell me!

450
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,960
Also,

451
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,070
the bandits

452
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,130
took the laborers hostage

453
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,310
to extort some money.

454
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,510
But it turned out that

455
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,110
those laborers didn't cooperate
and tried to escape.

456
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,750
So

457
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,600
the bandits chopped them.

458
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,630
Auntie!

459
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,570
Tietou's Mother!

460
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,550
What happened?

461
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,510
Get some water!

462
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,880
Come here.

463
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,470
Tietou's Mother.

464
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,030
This land...Land...

465
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,110
I just plowed for nothing.

466
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,860
What are you doing?

467
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,960
Here, drink some water.

468
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,810
Here,

469
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,680
take a sip, drink some water.

470
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,570
Wake up.

471
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,960
Zhuzi,

472
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,840
find some young men quickly
and search everywhere.

473
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,420
I'll carry Auntie back home
and then join you.

474
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:55,950
Alright!

475
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,260
Tietou!

476
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,490
Tietou!

477
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,960
Tietou!

478
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,530
Sister-in-law!

479
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,830
My Tietou!

480
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,680
Kuangzi!

481
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,450
Father's not home, right?

482
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,610
I didn't help him with
my Second Uncle's matter.

483
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,170
I guess he's still angry.
So I hid for two days.

484
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,600
I just came back to get my gun,
then I'll leave right away.

485
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
Don't tell Father I was back.

486
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,210
I'm leaving.

487
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,630
Father, you're home?

488
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,310
Kuangzi.

489
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,900
How can you let Father do chores?

490
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,960
Quick, take that broom away from him.

491
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,070
Let me teach you for taking sides
against your own family!

492
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,000
No, no, Father!

493
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,640
What are you doing?

494
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,170
What are you doing, Father?

495
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,880
I don't know!

496
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,080
Father, what are you doing?

497
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,780
What's this about, Father?

498
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,580
You and your sister together...

499
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,500
Don't hit the wrong person!

500
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,270
Disrespecting your own father!

501
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,800
What are you doing, Father?

502
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Hey, why are you still angry?

503
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,490
Who's to blame for this?

504
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,470
You didn't care about
Second Uncle's matter,

505
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,750
why are you going for the jugular?

506
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,980
Now you think you're in the right?

507
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,700
You made me lose 30 mu of good land!

508
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,580
You're hitting the wrong person!

509
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,560
Father, stop hitting me!

510
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,610
I have a gun here!

511
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,610
I'm warning you, bullets don't have eyes.

512
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,130
What?

513
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,290
You want to shoot your own father?

514
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,210
Come on!

515
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Shoot right here.

516
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,350
How could I ever hurt you, Father?

517
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,130
Don't be so angry.

518
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,950
What's all this about?

519
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,500
You ungrateful brat.

520
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
I feel worn out.

521
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,070
Hello, Wendian.

522
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,580
I wonder how things are at home
since you went back.

523
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,790
After you left,

524
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,310
our organization
has undergone some changes.

525
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,110
I wanted to inform you promptly.

526
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,660
Your group

527
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,610
has been divided into two parts.

528
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,160
One part

529
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,470
continues to go into nearby villages

530
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,340
to understand and support

531
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,070
the establishment
of Farmers' Associations.

532
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,160
The other part

533
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,950
has begun preparing for the arrival
of the Southern Army.

534
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,830
Farmers' Associations have been launched

535
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,740
across the country with great momentum.

536
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,920
I wonder how things are in your hometown.

537
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,750
I hope you can unite

538
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,150
the farmers in your area.

539
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,830
Help them know the nature and purpose
of Farmers Associations.

540
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,790
So for this era of great transformation,

541
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,390
you can contribute
your ability and strength.

542
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,070
Have you checked
all the neighboring villages?

543
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,070
I've checked everywhere, but nothing.

544
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,420
Alright, go home and get some rest.

545
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,900
Okay.

546
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,710
Zhuzi.

547
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,580
Dajiao.

548
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,630
I went to Pan Xiaogui's house.

549
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,800
His family was scared out of their wits.

550
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,240
They wouldn't even open the door.

551
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,780
They claimed to know nothing
about anything I asked.

552
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,460
I also went to Xiazhuang and

553
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,370
several nearby burial grounds as well.

554
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,770
I haven't heard anything about
bandits attacking anyone.

555
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,830
Actually, it's also a good thing that

556
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,440
we can't find Tietou.

557
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,270
You've been working on this all day,

558
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,530
go home and get some rest.

559
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,920
I'll go check the markets of laborers,

560
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
both near and far,

561
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,800
to look for him.

562
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,940
Alright then.

563
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,030
Be careful.

564
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,250
Did you really see
our village's Tietou yesterday?

565
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,010
I've been looking for him for days.

566
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,350
That must be him. Earlier,

567
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,680
I brought him back from laborer's market.

568
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,240
Go in and see for yourself. Come.

569
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,620
Check what Mr. Bai wrote
on the blackboard.

570
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,400
Come on, make way.

571
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,680
What does this mean?

572
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,400
Don't rush,

573
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,530
let me explain it to everyone slowly.

574
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,400
If you have any questions later,
you can come up and ask me.

575
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
I have a question.

576
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,280
Go ahead.

577
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
What will the Farmers' Association

578
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,470
bring for us?

579
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,750
Right, what can the Farmers' Association
bring for us?

580
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,920
You were just telling us about
permanent tenancy.

581
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,690
How does this permanent tenancy. work?

582
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,580
That's a good question,

583
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,340
a very good question indeed.

584
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,400
Take me for example.

585
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,600
I rent land from the Madam,

586
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
the widow of the Fei family.

587
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,680
Farming this small land,

588
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,610
I've been living in fear for years.

589
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,030
I'm afraid that one day,

590
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,430
they'll find an excuse
to take it away from me.

591
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,750
But I never expected.

592
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,200
She didn't even discuss it with me.

593
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,030
She just took it back without warning,

594
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,310
leaving my Mother and me
with nothing to eat.

595
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,310
But what can we do?

596
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,310
Yes, exactly.

597
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,840
This Farmers' Association

598
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,870
is here to handle exactly
this kind of problem.

599
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,590
One of our Farmers' Association's duties

600
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,720
is to fight for permanent tenancy rights.

601
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,330
That means once I farm Madam's land,

602
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,440
I should be able to farm it forever,

603
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,450
I can't let them take it away from me
whenever they want,

604
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,310
or give it to whoever they please.

605
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,720
That sounds good!

606
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,550
I want to join!

607
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,470
I want to join too!

608
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,630
I also want to join the Farmers' Association.

609
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:45,990
Good.

610
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,320
Good.

611
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Count me in too.

612
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,800
I want to join as well.

613
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I want to join too.

614
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,700
Count me in too.

615
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,160
How do we sign up for
this Farmers' Association you mentioned?

616
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,270
Go ask Mr. Bai about it. Go.

617
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,740
Tietou!

618
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,730
Don't rush. One at a time.

619
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,540
Put that down.

620
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,220
You've been so hard to find.

621
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,560
What? Why are you looking for me?

622
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,360
I heard that

623
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,790
Pan Xiaogui's house
was raided by the bandits,

624
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,650
and even laborers were captured.

625
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,790
Your Mother and I have been worried sick.

626
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,790
Tell me,

627
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,440
did you run into the bandits?

628
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,000
Also,

629
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,970
how did you end up
in this Farmers' Association?

630
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,640
That day,

631
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,640
the bandits surrounded
Pan Xiaogui's house.

632
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,570
Luckily, I was quick-witted

633
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,240
and escaped by jumping over the wall.

634
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,070
Your Uncle Si was luckier than me.

635
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,270
He wasn't even there.

636
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,970
They said he went to help with
someone's wedding or funeral.

637
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,370
I thought I couldn't go back empty-handed.

638
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,930
So I went to the laborers' market.

639
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,970
And that's where I met Mr. Bai.

640
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,030
Come on, bro.

641
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,150
Take a look.

642
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,230
Come here, brother. Take a look

643
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,890
at our Farmers' Association.

644
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,400
Does your Farmers' Association

645
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,490
handle cases
where landlords take back land randomly?

646
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,380
Brother,

647
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,240
that's an excellent question.

648
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,910
Our Farmers' Association

649
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,470
not only handles cases of landlords
arbitrarily taking back land,

650
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,070
but also

651
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,400
deals with demanding
reductions in rent and interest,

652
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,270
and permanent tenancy rights.

653
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,000
Mr. Bai said that for this Farmers' Association,

654
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,350
if you want to learn more,

655
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,590
you'll need to join the study group first.

656
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,510
As soon as I heard that,

657
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,510
I came right over.

658
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,520
Alright,

659
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,020
you can go back now.

660
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,490
Go tell my Mother I'm fine,

661
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,240
and don't let her worry all day.

662
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,350
Don't be in such a hurry to leave.

663
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,910
You should go home quickly.

664
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,030
Meeting you will put your mother's mind
at ease.

665
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,110
She's fainted from crying several times.

666
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,510
That's just ridiculous,

667
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,210
believing whatever people say?

668
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,870
You should still go back home.

669
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,350
Your Sister-in-law

670
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,800
has got your land back for you.

671
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,460
My father has canceled the land lease contract.

672
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,790
Mrs. Fei said

673
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,020
your family can rent it for another year.

674
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,680
For those peanut seeds we bought,

675
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,120
we've already planted most of them.

676
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Hurry back and plant the rest,

677
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,470
so your Mother can have
some peace of mind.

678
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,620
Let me tell you something.

679
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,310
You didn't need to go through
all this trouble.

680
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,030
Even if you hadn't done anything,

681
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,530
I could have got back
those 13 mu of land in Sesame Gully

682
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,790
from Widow Fei myself.

683
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,400
Do you know why I joined
this Farmers' Association?

684
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
This association can help me
get my land back

685
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,510
and secure permanent tenancy rights.

686
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,750
Once I have permanent tenancy,

687
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,960
that old widow can't take it back
even if she wants to.

688
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,490
Alright,

689
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,110
go back home and wait.

690
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,000
From now on,

691
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,380
follow me and work hard.

692
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,160
I promise

693
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,060
I won't let you lose anything.

694
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,500
Tietou.

695
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,370
Alright, I've got things to do,

696
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,630
this is never-ending!

697
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,620
So troublesome.

698
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,140
Go home now!

699
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,240
You weren't there to see Tietou like that.

700
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,760
He acted like some big official

701
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,920
when he talked to everyone
about the Farmers' Association.

702
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,180
I couldn't help laughing at his big head.

703
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,400
What did Tietou talk about?

704
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,720
He said the same things as Mr. Du.

705
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,520
He said this Farmers' Association

706
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,650
is meant to

707
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,390
protect us peasants from

708
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,550
being taken advantage of.

709
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,680
They ask for permanent tenancy rights.

710
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,940
That's all it's about.

711
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
These days,

712
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,180
visit the tenant families more often

713
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,370
to check whose family
needs seeds or farming tools,

714
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,770
and take care of them all.

715
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,480
When have you ever not looked after them?

716
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,430
Sister-in-law.

717
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,640
You...

718
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,160
Where are you going?

719
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,560
It's windy today,
the earth energy is stirring,

720
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,720
so it's perfect for flying kites.

721
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,200
What kite flying?

722
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,210
You're pregnant,

723
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,790
and flying kites means
running, jumping,

724
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,960
and waving your arms about,

725
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,400
you might harm the baby.

726
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,950
You really want to fly kites?

727
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,130
Then I'll ask Wendian
to fly it for you to watch, how's that?

728
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,190
Qing.

729
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,360
Madam.

730
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,500
Where is the Young Master?

731
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,460
The Young Master isn't here.

732
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,790
These past few days,
he's been leaving before dawn

733
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,950
and only returning in the evening.

734
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,780
Evening?

735
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,110
About the Farmers' Association,

736
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,440
I've heard about it too.

737
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,240
So that's why
you've been running around these days.

738
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
You visit Farmers' Associations
in different villages?

739
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,060
Yes.

740
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,790
You're not even part of
the Farmers' Association,

741
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,850
so what do you want to talk to me about?

742
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,240
Mother, I'm home.

743
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,290
You never lock the door at night,

744
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,950
how many times have I told you?

745
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,550
Mother, I keep telling you
to lock the door at night,

746
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,750
why won't you listen?

747
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,330
You damn boy,

748
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,590
so you still remember to come home,

749
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,650
you still remember you have a mother?

750
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,670
Alright, Mother,

751
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,960
I'm back now, aren't I?

752
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,760
Mother, I'm starving,

753
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,350
is there anything to eat?

754
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,090
Make me something good to eat.

755
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,740
Make me something good to eat, come!

756
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,100
Alright, stop crying.

757
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,850
I'm starving.

758
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,280
The Farmers' Association
hasn't even arrived yet,

759
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,180
but our own family is already in turmoil.

760
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,530
Who would believe that?

761
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,070
Why should I
offer permanent tenancy first?

762
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,200
My tenants have no complaints about me.

763
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,240
I've been visiting each household
these days.

764
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,880
Whoever needs farming tools,
and whoever needs seeds,

765
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,510
I take care of them every year.

766
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,750
Where would they find
a landlord as good as me?

767
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,920
Yes, Sister-in-law,

768
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,310
you've done quite well.

769
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,040
But that's not the point.

770
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,400
What I'm doing now

771
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,030
is helping all the hardworking people
understand that

772
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,630
injustice has existed for
thousands of years.

773
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,110
We must resist
exploitation and oppression,

774
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,970
and overthrow the mountains
weighing on everyone.

775
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,400
Who are the mountains?

776
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,110
I'm not.

777
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,770
I'm your Sister-in-law.

778
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
As you said,

779
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,160
this is what our ancestors left us,

780
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,610
it's been like this
for thousands of years.

781
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,310
If we're talking about unfairness,

782
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,200
I'm not the one who made it unfair,

783
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,380
so why should I be the first to change?

784
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,960
I need to do this now,

785
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,050
and you're my Sister-in-law,
you should support me.

786
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,160
Good that you know I'm your Sister-in-law,

787
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,110
so listen to me.

788
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,310
Spend more time with Susu
when you're free,

789
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,470
stop running around outside all the time.

790
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,200
When you understand
what it means to be a father,

791
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,720
then you can come back
and teach your Sister-in-law

792
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,180
how to manage a household.

793
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,350
Sister-in-law.

794
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,240
Besides,

795
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,510
in Ox Temple Village,

796
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,160
I'm not the only one with tenants,

797
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,820
why do you keep focusing on me?

798
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,640
That doesn't make sense either.

799
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,550
Why can't I make you understand?

800
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,470
Also

801
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,920
your Brother Dajiao
and Sister-in-law Xiuxiu

802
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,120
have done a great job.

803
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,000
They've been keeping an eye on Mrs. Fei

804
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,000
and helped us get our land back.

805
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,850
They even secretly kept it
from your uncle Feng Er

806
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,960
and bought fruit seeds for us.

807
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,310
They said they want to support us
this year

808
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,630
to help us turn our lives around.

809
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,470
Son.

810
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,750
This year, you need to put
all your strength

811
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,400
into working our land

812
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,580
and stop working as a laborer.

813
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:51,720
Mother.

814
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,650
Let me tell you.

815
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,680
This land,

816
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,150
I won't just farm it for a year

817
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,620
but I'll keep farming it forever.

818
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,420
That widow can't take it from us.

819
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,150
We'll talk
when I don't want to farm it anymore.

820
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,190
Did you sleep in the graveyard last night?

821
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,650
What possessed you?

822
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,190
Mother, you don't understand.

823
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,920
From now on,
you'll have a good life with your son.

824
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,240
Xiu.

825
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,770
Where have you been so early this morning?

826
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,790
I went to the fields.

827
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,960
I ran into Tietou.

828
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,570
I told him to plant the rest of the land,

829
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,900
but he said there's no rush,

830
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,300
and he has some big plans.

831
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,220
Tietou must be going crazy.

832
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,790
We went through so much trouble

833
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,790
to get that land back for him,

834
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,060
why isn't he in a hurry to plant it?

835
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,540
Dajiao, don't mess around with him.

836
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,740
I won't mess with him.

837
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,260
It's spring planting season,
I need to plant.

838
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,460
Dajiao, there wasn't

839
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,520
enough wheat straw ash
in the field yesterday.

840
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,520
Burn more today

841
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,790
and spread it all.

842
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:53,970
Have some.

843
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,180
What's wrong with you?

844
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,090
Nothing.

845
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,440
Father,

846
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,790
I'll bring you lunch later.

847
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,360
I'm full.

848
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,300
You are full?

849
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,120
Just leave it here, I'll clean up.

850
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,010
You don't need to do this.

851
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,210
Xiu,

852
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,880
if you're not feeling well, just lie down.

853
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,330
Why has Xiu been so absent-minded
these days?

854
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,170
I wonder if she's pregnant.

855
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,490
Don't overthink it, that's not possible.

856
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,020
How am I overthinking?
You don't understand.

857
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,500
When I was pregnant with you,
I wasn't happy at all.

858
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,480
Just like her now,

859
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,280
suffering from minor ailments.

860
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,000
Do you remember?

861
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,590
I had morning sickness for three months
when I was pregnant with Dajiao.

862
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,020
How would I remember that clearly?

863
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,070
I'm not a...

864
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,240
not an old woman.

865
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,170
Father.

866
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,110
I'm not going to the fields with you today

867
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,370
to spread the wood ash.

868
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,180
Where are you going?

869
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,300
I'm going to see Tietou for some issues.

870
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,690
This guy isn't

871
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,139
working for Tietou's family, is he?

872
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:23,820
Yinzi.

873
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,330
I've missed you so much.

874
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,520
Yinzi, let me tell you.

875
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,750
You're going to live the good life
with me from now on.

876
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,350
What?

877
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,429
Did you find a gold nugget?

878
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,159
Not exactly.

879
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,760
I've joined the Farmers' Association.

880
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,480
The head of the association
has given me authority

881
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,429
to establish a Farmers' Association
in our village.

882
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,360
I'm the leader,

883
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,320
the director of the Farmers' Association.

884
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,320
Yinzi, let me tell you,

885
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,090
I've learned so much while I was away.

886
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,219
Times are changing.

887
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,690
Stop picking those up. Come here,

888
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,210
Get up.

889
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,340
I want to talk to you properly.

890
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,820
Come,

891
00:34:59,210 --> 00:34:59,870
have a seat.

892
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,470
Sit.

893
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,460
Come on,

894
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:04,820
sit down.

895
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,410
Let me tell you,

896
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,030
from now on, the affairs of our village

897
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,960
won't be managed by soldiers,

898
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,590
magistrates,
or township officials anymore.

899
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,360
It will be managed by
the Farmers' Association.

900
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,280
And in the future,
when the association grows stronger,

901
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,800
it will be

902
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,730
us poor peasants who rule the land.

903
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,570
Now that I, Feng Tietou,
have become the leader,

904
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,830
I must lead by example.

905
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,590
I'll first get permanent tenancy
for those 13 mu of land in Sesame Gully,

906
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,710
and then in autumn...

907
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,190
No.

908
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,270
Summer.

909
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,750
In summer, I'll marry you.

910
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,120
Yinzi.

911
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,060
I want to be like Dajiao

912
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,280
and hire an eight-man sedan chair for you

913
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,400
and musicians too.

914
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,470
I want you to marry me in grand style

915
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,070
so the whole village can see.

916
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,670
Will the Farmers' Association
give you money?

917
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,850
Will they give you seeds
and help you farm?

918
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,880
Why are you only thinking about
immediate benefits?

919
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,840
Now that I'm the leader,

920
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,770
don't you think all that will come?

921
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,300
If you still don't even have money
for seeds,

922
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,520
stop dreaming.

923
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,760
Why don't you believe me?

924
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
I'm not dreaming.

925
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,840
Let me tell you about
this Farmers' Association.

926
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,400
It's not...

927
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,330
Brother Tietou.

928
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,100
My Mother's illness is getting worse.

929
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,730
She's gasping all night long,

930
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,590
and her eyes are swollen to slits.

931
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,370
Brother Tietou,

932
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,840
do you have any ideas?

933
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,260
Well, don't worry.

934
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
Just wait a little longer,
wait until I get the permanent tenancy

935
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,800
and gain harvest...

936
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,210
I doubt whether my mother could survive
until spring planting,

937
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,200
let alone wait for you to have
permanent tenancy and harvest.

938
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,220
We've been short of grains these days.

939
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,420
We've dug up all the wild greens on hill,

940
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
and even boiled tree bark to eat.

941
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,050
My little siblings cry from hunger
all day.

942
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,510
Father is busy farming

943
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,710
and can't go looking for laboring jobs.

944
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,990
Don't, don't cry.

945
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,290
Sometimes, I really hate that I'm a woman.

946
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,460
Well, you'll be amazing.

947
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,460
If you were a man,

948
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
I'd still be liking you.

949
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,150
Aren't you amazing?

950
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,150
Don't cry.

951
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,560
It's okay.

952
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,450
All right.

953
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,480
Don't cry.

954
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,660
Don't cry.

955
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,830
I don't know how much longer
I can hold on.

956
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,200
Yinzi.

957
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,610
Trust me,

958
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,260
things will get better soon.

959
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,590
It will get better soon,

960
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,630
trust me.

961
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,570
I'm going home.

962
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,250
Yinzi, you...

963
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,570
This matter...

964
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,750
how could it bother you to come in person?

965
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,570
I should handle this myself.

966
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,590
I should never send the young here.

967
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,890
Susu's pregnancy is a blessing
for the Fei family,

968
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,840
and for the Ning family too!

969
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,840
I'm just overjoyed.

970
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,860
It's wonderful.
She used to refuse marriage,

971
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,020
but now she's pregnant,
everything's perfect.

972
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,420
Yes, perfect indeed.

973
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,080
Perfect.

974
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,550
I'll send someone soon

975
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,520
to buy some soft millet from Caopo,

976
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,490
and autumn dates from Xiazhuang.

977
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,860
Take these over

978
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,700
to help Susu regain her strength.

979
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,480
We already have all these at home.

980
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,110
How could a Fei family's daughter-in-law

981
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,710
be left wanting?

982
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,660
I've even laid out the best for her.

983
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,160
Uncle Ning,

984
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,590
I also came to ask you about something.

985
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,070
There's been talking about
some Farmers' Association

986
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,570
and permanent tenancy rights?

987
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,700
You're the richest in Ox Temple Village.

988
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,600
If these peasants

989
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,110
really start causing trouble
over this association,

990
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,110
they'll surely confront you first.

991
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,810
You must have figured out

992
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,400
a solution, right?

993
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,110
No, no, no.

994
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,120
Please don't.

995
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
What I have isn't anything special.

996
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,070
In our county,

997
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,150
what I own isn't worth mentioning.

998
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,120
If there really were
a Farmers' Association,

999
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,650
they wouldn't make a fuss about
my small land.

1000
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,550
Besides,

1001
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,360
though I have more land than you,

1002
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,570
I don't have many tenant farmers.

1003
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,830
For my land,

1004
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,210
I farm most of it myself

1005
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,740
or hire laborers to farm it.

1006
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,990
Fewer tenants

1007
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,900
means fewer problems,

1008
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,700
right?

1009
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,430
Unlike yours,

1010
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,050
with no man around,

1011
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,930
though you have less land,

1012
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,190
you have more tenants,

1013
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
so more troubles.

1014
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,030
But about

1015
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,320
reduction in rents and interests,

1016
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,650
and permanent tenancy,

1017
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,610
we should also

1018
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,970
think about it carefully beforehand.

1019
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,470
I do have many tenants.

1020
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,140
But I never stabbed behind their backs.

1021
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,560
Whatever the matter is,

1022
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,440
I always put it on the table,

1023
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,880
and deal with it openly.

1024
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,360
I believe

1025
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,280
I've been quite attentive to
these tenants.

1026
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,110
They should show me
some respect in return.

1027
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:07,930
After all,

1028
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,840
I haven't made enemies with anyone.

1029
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,490
Don't you think they should

1030
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,210
be more lenient with me than others?

1031
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,890
I don't have enemies either.

1032
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,030
I'll leave now.

1033
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,360
Father.

1034
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,590
Mrs. Fei is here.

1035
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,400
Later,

1036
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,420
I'll have Kuangzi

1037
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
bring over some millet and jujubes.

1038
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,670
No need.

1039
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,170
I've said it before,

1040
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,920
a woman who marries into the Fei family

1041
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,580
is never short of such things.

1042
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,540
Please don't see me out.

1043
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,290
Take care, Mrs. Fei.

1044
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,030
What's wrong?

1045
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,300
She doesn't look well.

1046
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,440
She came to sound me out,
but I shut her down.

1047
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,840
Sound you out about what?

1048
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,120
About the Farmers' Association?

1049
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,030
That's right.

1050
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,680
Father, that's exactly why I'm here.

1051
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,580
The nearby villages have already
started causing trouble.

1052
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,960
But don't worry, Father.

1053
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,890
I'm here for you.

1054
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,620
No one will dare to bother you.

1055
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,730
Don't get caught up in this nonsense.

1056
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,630
Let me wait and see how things'll develop.

1057
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,510
If things get worse,
we'll consult with your Uncle Pan.

1058
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,840
Uncle Pan has already been transferred to
the provincial capital.

1059
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,040
He's too far away to help us now, Father.

1060
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,360
Why the rush?

1061
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,770
We'll cross that bridge

1062
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,070
when we come to it.

1063
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,760
Our village doesn't even have
a Farmers' Association yet, right?

1064
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,190
Here.

1065
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,130
Take it.

1066
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,430
Here.

1067
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,900
Listen, I'm telling you all.

1068
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm thinking of you first
when good things come my way.

1069
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,960
We grew up together, playing in the mud.

1070
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,590
If I make it big,

1071
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,190
I'll bring you all up with me.

1072
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,710
I'm going to do great things,

1073
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,770
and we'll do them together
like brothers, understand?

1074
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,800
Tietou!

1075
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,530
What are you doing?

1076
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:01,900
Coming!

1077
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,620
Perfect timing!

1078
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,660
It's better that you came
than me having to find you.

1079
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,030
Come,

1080
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,720
look.

1081
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,010
These are our Farmers' Association badges.

1082
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,360
Once these badges are distributed,

1083
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,260
our Farmers' Association

1084
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,120
will be officially established.

1085
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,440
Since Dajiao has come on his own,

1086
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,300
he'll be my assistant from now on.

1087
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,790
Baisui, Zhiquan,

1088
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,940
you two will be team leaders.

1089
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,450
Sure.

1090
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,460
Niu Wu, Qian Sheng,

1091
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,060
you two

1092
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,770
will also be team leaders.

1093
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,230
So we're team leaders too.

1094
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,140
What do you want us to do?

1095
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,470
We'll follow your lead.

1096
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,440
What to do?

1097
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,830
First, we'll deal with that old widow
who loves taking back land.

1098
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,490
She's really screwed me over.

1099
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,920
After we deal with her,
we'll talk about the rest.

1100
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,400
Good.

1101
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,690
How do we handle it?

1102
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,690
Why do you ask so many questions?

1103
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,970
Are you the leader or am I?

1104
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,030
Do I need to report everything to you?

1105
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,530
That would be ridiculous.

1106
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,950
I know what to do.

1107
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:55,960
See this?

1108
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,310
Everything is in here.

1109
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,440
What's in there?

1110
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,230
Just stuff,

1111
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,840
right?

1112
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,450
Alright.

1113
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,070
Right?
