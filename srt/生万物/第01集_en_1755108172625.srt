The place under my feet

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,070
is Turtle Hill.

not only has my bones and blood,

8
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,150
but also this heavenly stone.

9
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,880
My husband told me

10
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,030
this ox figure is
a rare stone from heaven.

11
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,920
It sits here silently,

12
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,590
guarding

But I

still often think of

the solar term that day

She's like a city girl.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,630
The Fei family's ancestors
must've done great deeds

45

to let Fei Wendian marry such a good wife.

Mother, everyone says I look like you
when you were young.

51
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,310
Do I look even more like you now?

52
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,360
Who said that?

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,060
You're much prettier than me.

54

the Fei family will be here
to pick you up in their sedan.

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,110
By the way, Lianye,

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,310
have you prepared
the soup balls to be eaten

60
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,520
before going on the sedan?

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,400
It's still early. I'll do it later.

62
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
Go now.

63
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,910
Okay.

64
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,800
Mother, let me taste it for Xiuxiu.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,470
Enough.

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,930
You gravitate toward food.

It's not your wedding.

Here.

This is ten silver coins.

73
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,730
It's my personal savings,
not from your father.

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,430
Although the Fei family is a rich family,

75
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,360
it's better to have your own money.

76
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,070
Your father didn't prepare any for you,

77
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,480
but I can't let you down.

-No.
-Be good.

82
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,390
I have nowhere to spend it.

83
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,920
Alright.

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,270
Xiuxiu, just take it,

85
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,510
or else Father'll ask for it back.

86
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,190
Be good.

87
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,310
Yes.

88
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't let your father know.

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,190
Otherwise, he'll quarrel with me again.

90
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,160
Thank you, Mother.

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Let me test
the locks of these boxes for you.

Mother, I greased

93
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,720
all the keys again.

94
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,270
I've tested them. They all work.

95
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,480
I still have to test them.

96
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,410
I'll feel relieved after testing.

97
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
This dowry lock brings good luck

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,390

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,530
that Mrs. Fei

108
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,800
Take it.

after walking through our door,

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,750
you'll no longer be

114
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,710

a sister-in-law is like a mother.

Madam,

145
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,430
I went to the inn in the county.

146
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,750
But the people there said

147
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,240
Young Master left before dawn.

148
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,190
I asked them where he went.

149
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,590
They didn't know either.

150
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,990
Where else can he go?

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,080
He probably got impatient and walked back.

152
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,240
Did you see him on your way back?

153
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,160
No.

154
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,850

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,670
No, don't.

188
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,000
If you can’t settle it,
pay with your land.

189
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Master Ning, Master Ning!

190
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,320
Master Ning, please be generous.

191
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,450
Don’t mind me. I mean well.

192
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,550
Cut the crap.

193
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,820
If you don't settle the debt today,

194
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,150
don't blame me
for not leaving you a way out.

195
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,270
No, no, no.

196
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,970
Master Ning.

197
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,290
You know

198
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,050
I'm so poor that I only have
the clothes on my back.

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,630
I had to pawn a hoe

200
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,960
to afford

201
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,750
half a box of wedding pastries.

202
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,840
But the shop doesn't sell half-boxes!

203
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,270
They sold me some crumbs.

204
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,750
How could I give them to you?

205
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,790
I just thought...

206
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,670
I'll kill you!

207
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,190
When your father was alive,

208
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,200
your family

209
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,150
didn't fare too badly.

210
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,840
Look at you now.

211
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,520
You can't even compare
with your brother Feng Er.

212
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,750
And you're trying all these tricks.

213
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,910
For the sake of my dead father,

214
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,430
please forgive me.

215
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,890
Please spare me.

216
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,840
With interest, 15 silver dollars in total.

217
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,100
Go back and prepare it.

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,750
Fifteen silver dollars?

219
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,600
Who is shouting here?

220
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,790
It's the wedding day.

221
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,330
Honey,

222
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,720
the groom's family will be here soon.

223
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,300
Don't let others see this.
It's embarrassing.

224
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,010
Don't worry about this.

225
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,870
How dare he lie to me on the wedding day?

226
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,470
You know it's the wedding day?

227
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,480
You should accumulate merits
for your daughter.

228
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,200
Get up.

229
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,200
Kneel.

230
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,240
Kneel!

231
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,820
Kuangzi, see the guest out.

232
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,780
Kuangzi, everyone who comes is a guests.

233
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,960
Make some tea.

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,870
Bring the wedding pastries

235
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,960
to host everyone.

236
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,150
Okay, Madam.

237
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,180
Get up.

238
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,410
Madam, my whole family

239
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,270
will never forget your kindness.

240
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,180
Go. Go.

241
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,120
Grandpa Ox,

242
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,900
thank you for blessing
Ox Temple Village.

243
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,630
Let me sweep the snow for you,

244
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,150
so that

245
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,350
you're more relaxed.

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,400
Great snow!

247
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,960
This year's wheat

248
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,720
sleeps in the snow.

249
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,510
Next year, I'll sleep with a bun.

250
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,270
Threading and flour for your face.

251
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,390
I'll eat your wedding pastries this year

252
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,550
and your red eggs next year.

253
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,000
Threading and flour for your face.

254
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,030
I can't hide it from you.

255
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,480
I feel

256
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,270
so sad inside.

257
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,360
I've liked Xiuxiu since childhood.

258
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,030
But she's marrying Fei Wendian now.

259
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,030
Go, go, go!

260
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,600
What's wrong?

261
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,100
Go away.

262
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,910
I was wondering who's fighting
for poop with my dog.

263
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,390
It’s Master Ning!

264
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,240
Why don't you wait for it to freeze?

265
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,360
Don't you think it stinks?

266
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,890
Dung is created from grain.

267
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,510
Grain births dung.

268
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,830
You think it's dirty,

269
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,130
but I think you poor people
don't understand at all.

270
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,550
When you harvest more grain,

271
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,120
you’ll know how good this dung is.

272
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,930
Mr. Ning,

273
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,390
isn’t today your daughter’s wedding day?

274
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,320
Why did you come out to pick up dung?

275
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,600
You know today is
my daughter's wedding day.

276
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,580
But some people

277
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,570
still pretend to be ignorant

278
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,080
and pretend not to see.

279
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,670
They don't even give me wedding pastries.

280
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,850
I feel so humiliated.

281
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,870
I came out today

282
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,390
to make those forgetful people

283
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,290
remember

284
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,870
that I, Ning Xuexiang,

285
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,440
don't marry off my daughter every day.

286
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,870
You have so many sharecroppers.

287
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,050
Can you eat it all?

288
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,310
That's my business.

289
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,280
If you don't gift me,

290
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,980
you'll be in trouble.

291
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,960
You'll be in trouble!

292
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,630
I've never seen

293
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,410
a moneybag with 700 mu of land
be so petty.

294
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,810
He even came out to beg for pastries.

295
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,070
Does he really need it?

296
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,150
Won't he feel

297
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,980
ashamed?

298
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,360
He doesn't care about that.

299
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,510
He carries a dung basket
just stepping out of his door.

300
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,240
He wishes he can crawl up an ox's butt.

301
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,900
For him, shame isn't as useful

302
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
as a pile of turd.

303
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,720
I'm in trouble too.

304
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,150
I pawned the hoe

305
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,840
to buy him some wedding pastries.

306
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,720
Pawned the hoe?

307
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,290
Are you not going to farm in spring?

308
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,120
I'll try to redeem it then.

309
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,780
What else?

310
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,410
Stingy.

311
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,120
Our fault for renting his land.

312
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,870
This time,

313
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,230
the village's two wealthy families
are getting married.

314
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,550
If we don't go congratulate them,

315
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,550
I don't think it'll be okay.

316
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,840
No way.

317
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,150
Just farm our own land well.

318
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,510
Besides,

319
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,700
we're not sharecroppers.

320
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,130
We don't have to be concerned about them.

321
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,920
It's not like you can go empty-handed.

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,370
You'd have to buy two bags
of wedding pastries.

323
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,530
That costs money.

324
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,150
Why should we spend money?

325
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,440
What's the basis?

326
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,360
Not a cent

327
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,600
of my money can be spent.

328
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Remember,

329
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,840
my money

330
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,370
can only be used to buy land.

331
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,210
I'll listen to you.

332
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,850
Let's just not interact with anyone.

333
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,360
When Dajiao gets married,

334
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,290
don't get mad if people don't come.

335
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,840
Gets married?

336
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,440
Who knows

337
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,270
if our daughter-in-law

338
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,720
is even born yet?

339
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,320
No one

340
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,960
catches our son's eye.

341
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,710
What?

342
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,670
He wants to marry a fairy?

343
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,670
Making your master go to your door
to ask for gifts.

344
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,950
I bet you can't stand the embarassment.

345
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,040
You going to the Ning or Fei Residence?

346
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
Where are they going?

347
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,670
You don't look familiar.

348
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,390
I'm from Gourd Glen.

349
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,560
My husband's name is Zhang Guanli.

350
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,510
This is my daughter.

351
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,000
My boss

352
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,670
owes money

353
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,390
to Master Ning

354
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,920
and it hasn’t been paid yet.

355
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,020
Today,

356
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,380
I heard it's your daughter's wedding day.

357
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,270
My boss told me

358
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,390
to get a wagon

359
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,870
to deliver gifts.

360
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,320
These are wedding pastries

361
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,920
I bought for you from the city
from Huaxinzhai.

362
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,630
It's delicious.

363
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,600
Thank you.

364
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,720
I've heard my husband mention

365
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,320
Zhang Guanli's name before.

366
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
I forgot.

367
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,720
You went through trouble
on this snowy day.

368
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,870
Mrs. Li, make tea for the guests.

369
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,150
Okay.

370
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,030
No, no.

371
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,200
No need.

372
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,600
I’m not thirsty.

373
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,550
Madam.

374
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,110
I...

375
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,750
I heard that

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,920
Miss Xiuxiu

377
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,640
looks like you

378
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,400
when you were young.

379
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,830
She looks like a fairy.

380
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,920
We've never seen her.

381
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,880
When she heard that I'm coming here,

382
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,230
my ignorant daughter

383
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,970
insisted on seeing the fairy.

384
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,030
Do you

385
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,890
think

386
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,560
you can

387
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,240
let me see her first?

388
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,270
Madam.

389
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,960
Alright.

390
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,270
Mrs. Li, take them there.

391
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,160
Yes, Madam.

392
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,960
Ladies, follow me.

393
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,070
Come.

394
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,920
Look.

395
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,380
Xiuxiu, my bangs

396
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,140
are the neatest and prettiest
when you cut them.

397
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,020
Our little crybaby is going to cry again.

398
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,940
You won't look good if you cry.

399
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Miss Xiuxiu,

400
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,960
female guests are here.

401
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,460
They want to see the bride.

402
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,640
Madam said they can see.

403
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,000
My sister is not a mirror.

404
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
You can't see her
just because you wanna.

405
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,590
It's fine, let them in.

406
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,400
Come in.

407
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,310
Xiuxiu,

408
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,930
put the covering on.

409
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,920
Mother has agreed. No need.

410
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,070
You must. Don't show them your face.

411
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,200
Hello, ladies.

412
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,590
If you want to see the bride,
I have to ask first

413
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,920
where you came from.

414
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,720
Chicken Ridge.

415
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,880
What are you doing here?

416
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,680
For this.

417
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,190
Xiuxiu!

418
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:58,930
Let's go.

419
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,590
Don't move.

420
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,680
Kidnapping!

421
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,070
Help! The bride has been kidnapped!

422
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
Kidnapping!

423
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,990
The bandits kidnapped her!

424
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,960
Xiuxiu has been kidnapped!

425
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,740
Over there!

426
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,480
That way!

427
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,310
Don't go!

428
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,740
Give my daughter back!

429
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,920
Madam!

430
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,240
Mother!

431
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,030
Madam!

432
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,790
Go!

433
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,640
Madam!

434
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,620
Mother, where is my sister?

435
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,000
Mother.

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hurry and go!

437
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,450
Get help!

438
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,350
Help! Help!

439
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,030
Hurry!

440
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,830
You're a girl.

441
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,790
What's the use of you chasing?

442
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,750
Kuangzi, go!

443
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,270
Get Kejin back and chase them!

444
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,920
Okay.

445
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,160
Kejin isn't here.

446
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
He didn't come back last night!

447
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,210
Mr. Er.

448
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,960
What's wrong?

449
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,500
Xiuxiu was kidnapped by the bandits!

450
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,820
Nephew, help me chase them!

451
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Go after them! Take a shortcut!

452
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,600
Stop!

453
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,550
Stop!

454
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,270
Hey, buddy.

455
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
Which hill are you from?

456
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Put down the bride.

457
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,070
Let's talk.

458
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,110
Listen.

459
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,640
My boss

460
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,890
is Big Nose Du.

461
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,610
I'm from Chicken Ridge!

462
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,550
Your bride

463
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,400
is the quick ransom

464
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,730
that I kidnapped today.

465
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,650
We won't torture

466
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,750
or kill her.

467
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,830
I just want real money.

468
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,290
Five thousand silver dollars!

469
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,290
Before midnight,

470
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,080
deliver it to Chicken Ridge

471
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,850
and I can release her any time.

472
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,400
Buddy!

473
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,480
That's too much money.

474
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,510
How about this?

475
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,310
Return the bride first.

476
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,480
Her in-laws

477
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,310
will be here soon.

478
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,190
I'm the head of the village.

479
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,070
My son...

480
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,750
My only son

481
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,790
will go with you

482
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,240
in exchange for the bride.

483
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,440
Father!

484
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,920
Your son?

485
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,240
Is your son a bride?

486
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,200
You playing me?

487
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,240
I'm telling you,

488
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,210
that girl is in the mountains now.

489
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,510
If I don't get the ransom by midnight,

490
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,720
I'm gonna

491
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
eat her up!

492
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,440
Buddy!

493
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,120
Let's go.

494
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,830
Let's go, Father.

495
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,680
Go!

496
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,790
That must be Master.

497
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,810
What are you looking at?

498
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,280
Are you laughing at me?

499
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,310
Master, you're back.

500
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,680
Master.

501
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,400
What's up?

502
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,030
Well…

503
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,110
Master, I'll be frank.

504
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,340
Miss Xiuxiu was kidnapped by bandits.

505
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,380
Xiuxiu!

506
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,000
Master is back!

507
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,000
Xiuxiu!

508
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,070
Xiuxiu!

509
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,270
Xiuxiu!

510
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,770
Miser Ning

511
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,920
always has his eyes on
this land and that land.

512
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,510
How about it? Karma hit him!

513
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,270
Yeah.

514
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,400
Honey,

515
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,840
you're finally back.

516
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,200
What should we do?

517
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,480
Do something!

518
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,110
Brother.

519
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,240
Honey.

520
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,110
Xiuxiu!

521
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,270
Honey!

522
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,030
Why are you running?

523
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,750
Brother.

524
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,810
Mother, slow down.

525
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,880
Listen to me, honey!

526
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,350
Big Nose Du.

527
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,810
My Xiuxiu!

528
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,550
Honey,

529
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,270
prepare her ransom money!

530
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,110
Girls

531
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,960
can't spend the night in a bandits' lair.

532
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,310
No matter how innocent she is,

533
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,310
it'll be hard to explain afterward.

534
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,200
How much?

535
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,210
Five thousand.

536
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,450
Five...

537
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,620
Five thousand?

538
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,270
Where can I get that money?

539
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,680
Hurry.

540
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,750
Coming.

541
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,120
What is it?

542
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,340
Close the door.

543
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,570
Why close the door
in the middle of the day?

544
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,890
What are you doing with the money?

545
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,080
What do you think?

546
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,660
There is only one thing

547
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,270
that deserves my money.

548
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,070
To buy land?

549
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,790
Who's selling land?

550
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,400
That Xiuxiu

551
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,720
was kidnapped by bandits.

552
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,110
I have to buy land from Miser Ning.

553
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,750
Madam.

554
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
You called for me?

555
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,880
How many guests are here?

556
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,880
Two tables.

557
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,750
There should be more than 20 people.

558
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,400
Mrs. Fei!

559
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,490
Wendian hasn't come back yet?

560
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,770
It's almost the auspicious time.

561
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,190
I think you two should

562
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,560
go out to pick up the bride
at the auspicious time.

563
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,510
Take it easy

564
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,480
on the way back.

565
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,010
Make some time for Wendian.

566
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,630
We'll be relieved

567
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,910
once the bride is here.

568
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,440
Sure.

569
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
I'll get ready

570
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,790
to pick her up.

571
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,310
Pick her up.

572
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,960
Let's go.

573
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,680
Madam Fei!

574
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,110
Something happened!

575
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,310
Something happened.

576
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,240
What happened?

577
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,960
What happened, Gui Yao?

578
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,940
Something happened to Wendian?

579
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,860
Ning Xiuxiu,

580
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,680
the Ning family's daughter.

581
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,130
Are they here to pick up the bride?

582
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,860
Doesn't look like it.

583
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,010
I bet they got the message

584
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,280
and they're here to get answers.

585
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,240
Master,

586
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,500
the in-laws...

587
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
The in-laws are here.

588
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,240
The elders are all here.

589
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,470
Greetings.

590
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,950
I was preparing to pick up the bride

591
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,150
when I heard the news.

592
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,070
Mrs. Fei,

593
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,360
our family

594
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,610
is sorry to you.

595
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,320
Auntie, let's not talk about this.

596
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm here to help.

597
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,200
How is it now?

598
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,470
You have a solution?

599
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,200
Uncle Ning.

600
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,260
Sister-in-law, have a seat.

601
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,000
Thank you.

602
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,270
Auntie, here.

603
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,790
Auntie.

604
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,510
It happened in a hurry,

605
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,030
but we can't panic.

606
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,680
The bandits

607
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,590
chose to kidnap Xiuxiu today.

608
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,320
It must've been planned.

609
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
They obviously just want money.

610
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,460
Let's collect money then.

611
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,830
I have some cash.

612
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,270
Borrow some more

613
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,570
and you can definitely reach 500 dollars.

614
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,070
The most important thing now

615
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,130
is to pay the ransom

616
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,090
and save Xiuxiu.

617
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,660
I have more than
100 silver dollars at home.

618
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,270
Collecting here and there will work.

619
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,750
If it's not enough,

620
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,830
ask Chairman Chu of Qingqi Society

621
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,070
and borrow 3,000 more.

622
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,200
Borrow...

623
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,790
You think we don't have to pay them back?

624
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,680
Besides,

625
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,400
what if I borrowed his money

626
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,590
and

627
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,410
he wanted to add some interest

628
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,070
and asked me to pay it back immediately?

629
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,830
Or if he added other terms,

630
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,760
what should I do?

631
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,400
They outnumber us and have real guns.

632
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,460
This money is

633
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,750
a knife on my neck.

634
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,240
But the bandits

635
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,310
chose this time to kidnap her.

636
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,510
Everyone knows

637
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,350
that if a bride

638
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,110
spends the night in a bandits' lair,

639
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,880
then...

640
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,760
I understand.

641
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,790
Honey,

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
after midnight,

643
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,640
her in-laws won't accept her anymore.

644
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,350
My Xiuxiu has waited for three years.

645
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,030
Stop talking about midnight!

646
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,510
Didn't Xuerui say

647
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,510
Big Nose Du won't kill

648
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,590
or torture her?

649
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,550
Our daughter will be fine.

650
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,680
Uncle,

651
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,240
it's not the time to sit and wait.

652
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,110
Whether Xiuxiu can

653
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,840
marry into the Fei family or not

654
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,140
is all up to you.

655
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,160
Of course I know.

656
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,590
She is my daughter.

657
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,350
If

658
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,350
we can't get enough money,

659
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Xuexiang, go up the mountain alone

660
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,920
and pay the money we have.

661
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
For the rest,

662
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,070
mortgage your land deed.

663
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,000
In the future,

664
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,590
we can exchange the money
for the land deed.

665
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,670
Fourth Uncle is right.

666
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,750
We can also

667
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,270
bring some grain to the mountain

668
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,240
and ask Big Nose Du for peace.

669
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,840
The grain and land deed

670
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,290
shows our sincerity.

671
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,510
I have grain, too. Take them all.

672
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,930
Grain is

673
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,660
planted and harvested every year.

674
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,120
We can save it again later.

675
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,350
The most important thing now

676
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,920
is Xiuxiu's innocence.

677
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,920
The bandits want money.

678
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,810
If I mortgage the land deed

679
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,110
and give food,

680
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,720
what if they don't want it and kidnap me?

681
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,510
Then you'll have to pay
5,000 dollars twice,

682
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,510
three times.

683
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,140
I've suggested solutions.

684
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,910
I'm old and fatigued.

685
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,240
I’m leaving.

686
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,240
Fourth Uncle.

687
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,310
Grandpa.

688
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,750
[Bandits' Lair]

689
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,720
The bride

690
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,300
is quite pretty.

691
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,050
I want to see your boss.

692
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:56,930
What?

693
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,160
You girl

694
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,400
are quite bold.

695
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,920
You want to see Boss?

696
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,070
What is it? Tell me.

697
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,680
Can you let me go first?

698
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,790
I will

699
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,710
give you the money later.

700
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,550
Are you kidding me?

701
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,270
Don't be afraid.

702
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,430
If I let you go,

703
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,550
who will pay me?

704
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,590
I can give you an IOU

705
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,480
or sign a pledge.

706
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,750
Your IOU

707
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,200
is useless!

708
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,160
If your father

709
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,960
doesn't pay me today,

710
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,750
you'll be the bride of everyone here.

711
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,480
Jiu,

712
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,720
keep an eye on her!

713
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:49,960
Sure thing!

714
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,550
Everyone,

715
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,150
don't take advantage of her!

716
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,270
Bro,

717
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,200
this successful kidnapping

718
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,750
is all thanks to

719
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,810
Miss Ma and Miao Chi.

720
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,190
Thank you, Second Boss.

721
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,590
Thank you, Boss.

722
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,030
I don’t think you'll get

723
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,670
the ransom money.

724
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,480
Father, Mother!

725
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,920
Kejin is back.

726
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,880
I'm back!

727
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Kejin!

728
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,350
You bastard!

729
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,030
Why are you running around

730
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,790
instead of guarding the home?

731
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,030
Father.

732
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,750
Did Big Nose Du do it?

733
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,510
I'll go to the Qingqi Society
to find Chairman Chu

734
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,830
and ask him to bring

735
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,680
all his men

736
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,810
and kill the bandit!

737
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,640
Kejin,

738
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,080
don't get yourself killed.

739
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,680
Be careful, Kejin.

740
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,670
Xuexiang,

741
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,720
even if you don't like it,
I have to tell you the truth.

742
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,180
This probably won't work.

743
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,510
This isn't guarding the village.
It's attacking their lair.

744
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,310
Chairman Chu won't do anything.

745
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,850
Second Uncle is right.

746
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,030
Chairman Chu and Big Nose Du

747
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,640
have always stayed away from each other.

748
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,500
They won't break the rules for us.

749
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,480
This method won't work.

750
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,160
Honey,

751
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,000
sell the house, land, grain.

752
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,650
I won't stop you from selling anything.

753
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,840
I just want you to save Xiuxiu.

754
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,690
You useless

755
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,520
old wretch!

756
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,550
All you do is complain.

757
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,090
Why are you scolding my mother?

758
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,350
She's not wrong to care for her daughter!

759
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,140
My Xiuxiu...

760
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Alright, Mother.

761
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,640
Auntie, since Uncle thinks

762
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,310
Kejin's idea is feasible,

763
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,480
then

764
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,200
don't worry.

765
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,750
Bandits don't cause trouble

766
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,310
every day.

767
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,790
If you can overcome this

768
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,830
without spending a fortune,

769
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,070
then

770
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,830
it must be good karma
from the Ning family's ancestors.

771
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,590
Just

772
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,630
thank them later.

773
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,030
I'll leave now.

774
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,410
Take care.

775
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
It's just that

776
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,400
the days are short now.

777
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,720
It will be dark

778
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,230
in a bit.

779
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,260
I'll wait for your news at home.

780
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,410
Take care.

781
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:50,830
Master.

782
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,640
What are you doing?

783
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,310
I'm looking for Master.

784
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,790
Master is busy. Get out!

785
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,000
Mrs. Fei!

786
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,310
Mrs. Fei!

787
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,020
Is there a solution?

788
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,140
I'm going home to wait for the news.

789
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,530
Why wait at home?

790
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,010
What are you doing here?

791
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,930
Mr. Ning.

792
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,920
Take a look.

793
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,650
I don't mean anything else.

794
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,510
Take it

795
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,310
to save your daughter.

796
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,030
Well, Mr. Ning,

797
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,590
have you

798
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,790
sold

799
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,880
that land

800
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,830
by the well in the west

801
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,010
of the village?

802
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,740
If not,

803
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,840
can you sell it to me?

804
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,850
See, the land

805
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,930
has spring droughts

806
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,600
and summer floods, right?

807
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,000
It's not worth much.

808
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,840
Well...

809
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,920
Anyway, take this.

810
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,050
Use it for the emergency.

811
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,150
Have you gone mad about wanting land?

812
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,400
Buy it if you want. This is too scary.

813
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,760
Go and ask. Even three-year-old kids know

814
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,320
the 15 mu of land in the west
is lakebed mud.

815
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,260
There's a harvest no matter what.

816
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,640
Now you say there are spring droughts
and summer floods,

817
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,440
and you want me to give you a few mu?

818
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,960
You can't even afford

819
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,000
a corner of that land!

820
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,440
I think you broke rascals

821
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,550
are just here to

822
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,280
take advantage of me.

823
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,550
Why don't you ask around

824
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,000
who I, Ning Xuexiang, am?

825
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,800
Get him out!

826
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,320
Hey.

827
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,810
I told you.

828
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,840
Don't ask for trouble.

829
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,940
You all go on!

830
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,800
Go on.

831
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,440
Go on.

832
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,840
Disperse.

833
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,590
Mr. Er, what's wrong?

834
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,480
Why are your eyes red?

835
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,550
Mr. Er,

836
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,110
you were trying to take advantage

837
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,170
of something but failed, didn't you?

838
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,320
He wants to save his daughter
without selling his land.

839
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,190
Impossible!

840
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,740
Er, you can’t let him
beat you for nothing.

841
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,880
Madam.

842
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,000
Madam.

843
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,800
Why is the yard so quiet?

844
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,400
Everyone heard

845
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,510
that Xiuxiu was kidnapped by bandits,

846
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,840
so they all nosily went to Ning Residence.

847
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,030
Is Wendian back?

848
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,550
No.

849
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,280
Good.

850
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,100
He can come back later.

851
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,030
When Wendian is back,

852
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,440
keep your mouth shut.

853
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,510
Don't let him know about Xiuxiu.

854
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,400
Got it.

855
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,810
Sister-in-law!

856
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,490
-Young Master is back.
-Sister-in-law.

857
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,320
Give it to me.

858
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,650
Thank you, Steward Liu.

859
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,040
Sister-in-law!

860
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,430
What took you so long?

861
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,030
I wanted to take a shortcut,

862
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,960
but the snow was too heavy
and I couldn't make it.

863
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,030
So I had to go back.

864
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,280
Well, haste makes no progress.

865
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,070
This new hairstyle

866
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,760
and the school's Western suit

867
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
looks so nice.

868
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,000
Sister-in-law,
can I wear this for the wedding?

869
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,110
No way.

870
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,710
The groom should wear the groom's clothes.

871
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,320
I've prepared them for you.

872
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,110
You only get married once in life.

873
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,110
Don't slack off.

874
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,670
Okay, I'll listen to you.

875
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,920
It's so festive.

876
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,630
Sister-in-law, did you manage all this?

877
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,890
Steward Liu and others did it.

878
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,160
Let's go inside.

879
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,150
What happened?

880
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,510
This Miser Ning

881
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,930
would rather lose his daughter
than his land.

882
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,280
He drove me out

883
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,760
and even hit my eye

884
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,030
with that money bag.

885
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,760
Let me see.

886
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,510
Go away.

887
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,170
If you went out to buy land now,

888
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,070
it's thanks to our ancestors' good karma

889
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,030
that you didn't get beaten up.

890
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,070
Tell me.

891
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,490
If something like this happened to us,

892
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,670
we'd definitely work
to rescue our daughter first.

893
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,030
I'd planned

894
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,880
to quickly buy the land.

895
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,110
I didn’t expect Miser Ning

896
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,880
wouldn't even mention it.

897
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,230
They have cash.

898
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,630
Nonsense.

899
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,510
He has 5,000 silver dollars at home

900
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,370
waiting for bandits to snatch up?

901
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,340
Then why didn't he
sell the land to raise money?

902
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,470
Anyway, it'll be good for his daughter

903
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,710
to stay with the bandits.

904
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,040
What are you talking about?

905
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,400
Something big happened.

906
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,230
The bride Xiuxiu

907
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,670
got kidnapped

908
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,630
by Chicken Ridge's bandits.

909
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,650
What are you doing?

910
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,840
He's going to watch the show.

911
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,640
Mole Cricket's here.

912
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,710
With Mole Cricket here,

913
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,760
the land deed will be done right.

914
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,000
Let’s see if Ning Xuexiang

915
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,330
will sell the land to redeem his daughter.

916
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,590
Xueshi is here.

917
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,880
I came as soon as I heard the news.

918
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,840
Xuexiang, sell the land now!

919
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,630
Many people in the village
came to me.

920
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,150
They had me come ask.

921
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,760
If you want to do it,

922
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,190
I'll find a buyer for you.

923
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:01,920
Look.

924
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,150
I've even brought over

925
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,710
the documents for writing a land deed.

926
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,440
Xiuxiu really got kidnapped by bandits?

927
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,360
Of course.

928
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,360
Xiuxiu is really done for now.

929
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,880
You bastard!

930
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,070
Are you still a Ning?

931
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,550
How could you do such an evil thing?

932
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,150
Hey,

933
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,110
what do you mean?

934
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,630
You won't sell the land?

935
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,840
You have money?

936
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,650
It's none of your business.

937
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,590
Get out!

938
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,240
You're unreasonable!

939
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,590
Wolves!

940
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,670
You are just a bunch of greedy wolves!

941
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,670
Listen, that's not the land.

942
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,230
It's my blood! My flesh!

943
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,110
My life!

944
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,990
You all want a bite at any chance.

945
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,230
A bunch of you!

946
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,000
Dream on!

947
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,680
How can you save her
without selling the land?

948
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,510
He's still not selling the land
to save her.

949
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,670
After tonight,

950
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
his daughter will be ruined.

951
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,710
Yeah, seriously.

952
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,840
What a pity.

953
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,670
Seriously.

954
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,140
Disperse.

955
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,760
Here.

956
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,950
Put this on.

957
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,160
It looks good.

958
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,070
If it doesn't fit,

959
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,510
we have to tailor it quickly.

960
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,760
The city folks

961
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,830
like to wear

962
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,510
suits and wedding dresses now.

963
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,320
They really look nice.

964
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,580
After you get married,

965
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,440
you can have
whatever modern style you want.

966
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,400
Not today.

967
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,360
The ancestors are watching.

968
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,080
We have to follow the rules.

969
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Let me see.

970
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,240
Looks great.

971
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,150
Master. Master!

972
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,550
I heard that Eldest Young Master

973
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,320
got kicked out by Chairman Chu

974
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,220
and is going up the mountain
to save Xiuxiu himself.

975
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,660
He took his men

976
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,920
on a shortcut

977
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,600
and are already going west.

978
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,800
Oh no.

979
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,030
This fool!

980
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,110
He's really on a suicide mission.

981
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,780
Father, think of a way!

982
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,780
So what if you lose your daughter?

983
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,090
You can't lose Kejin too!

984
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,800
Lianye, what are you talking about?

985
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,200
You foul-mouthed woman.

986
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,530
How have we lost Xiuxiu?

987
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,730
Mother, I'm worried.

988
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,840
I want Father to think of a solution.

989
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,920
Honey,

990
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,450
if you don't sell the land,

991
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
I'll go to the bandits' lair.

992
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,920
I'll save my daughter.

993
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,310
If I can't save her,

994
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,150
my daughter and I will die together.

995
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,150
Mother! Mother!

996
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,360
Don't be angry, Mother.

997
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,110
Mother, don't be angry.

998
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,020
What are you doing?

999
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,290
Don't be unreasonable.

1000
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,400
She's my daughter too.

1001
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,860
I'm just as worried as you.

1002
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,920
All right.

1003
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,320
I'll go back to my room

1004
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,780
to get the land deed's box.

1005
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,220
I'll sell the land and raise money.

1006
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,600
You two must be tired.

1007
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,760
Go back now.

1008
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,950
I'm going back to my room
to get the land deed's box.

1009
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,750
Xuexiang,

1010
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,630
call me if you need anything.

1011
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,690
Sister-in-law, I'm leaving.

1012
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,320
You coward.

1013
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,650
Why don't you go in?

1014
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,190
I'm not in a hurry.

1015
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,230
I'm worried for the girl.

1016
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,320
It’s getting dark.

1017
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,230
Is Miser Ning really not going to
ransom her?

1018
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,540
She's his daughter.

1019
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,480
He's gotta ransom her no matter what.

1020
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,610
Besides, Miser Ning has 700 mu of land.

1021
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,440
Da Zong,

1022
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,070
I have a favor to ask.

1023
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,320
If no one comes

1024
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,150
and Second Boss finishes up,

1025
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,190
you gotta let me have my go.

1026
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,230
You go tell Second Boss.

1027
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,730
We’ll all go easy on you.

1028
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,230
How dare I?
