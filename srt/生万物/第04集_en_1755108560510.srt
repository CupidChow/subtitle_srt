[This Thriving Land]

00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,920
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,150
What is there to do?

4
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,590
Go.

5
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,050
Pack some of her favorite clothes

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,090
and items she usually uses.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,229
Pack them all up for her.

8
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,789
Got it!

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,840
Honey,

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,970
prepare a dowry for Xiuxiu.

11
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,840
If you don't want to spend a penny,

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,500
I'll give Xiuxiu all the dowry

13
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,080
I got from my mother.

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
Fine.

15
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,450
Don't fret. I'll give her something.

16
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,410
I will, okay?

17
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,290
She can have five mu of land

18
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,060
near the well
on the west side of the village.

19
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,720
Not enough.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,050
Ten mu, alright?

21
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,770
Not enough!

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,100
Xiuxiu has been put through a lot.

23
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,240
She deserves 15 mu of fertile land!

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,079
Niwei!

25
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Niwei, come here!

26
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,540
What's the matter?

27
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,829
Deliver a message

28
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,100
to your uncle.

29
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,370
Tell him the bride will arrive soon.

30
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,040
Get a move on, now!

31
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,570
Got it.

32
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,960
See, this is meant to be, isn't it?

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Thank God Feng Er
borrowed a carriage today.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,920
Xiuxiu!

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,960
Xiuxiu!

36
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,710
Mrs. Ning.

37
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,370
Xiuxiu,

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,430
your father

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,850
has agreed to gift you
15 mu of fertile land

40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,260
near the well as your dowry.

41
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,110
I won't try to stop you
if you do want to get married.

42
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,760
Today,

43
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,680
I'll make three vows.

44
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,860
I, Ning Xiuxiu,

45
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,690
from the moment
I step out of the Ning Residence,

46
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,720
will never step back in again.

47
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,590
Second,

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,630
I, Ning Xiu Xiu,
will not eat a single rice grain

49
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,410
of the Ning family or take anything away.

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,310
Third,

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,350
I, Ning Xiu Xiu,

52
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,550
no longer have a father.

53
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,150
Xiuxiu!

54
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,220
Xiuxiu, Mother!

55
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,910
Xiuxiu!

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,750
Xiuxiu!

57
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,560
Careful.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,630
Xiuxiu, I'm back.

59
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,680
Where are you going?

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Susu, Susu.

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,400
Where is my sister going?

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,590
She is getting married.

63
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,000
T-To whom?

64
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,630
She's marrying Feng Dajiao.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,750
Mother,

66
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,330
isn't Xiuxiu supposed to marry Wendian?

67
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,790
Why is she marrying Feng Dajiao now?
Xiuxiu!

68
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,840
What is this about, Mother?

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,960
Alright.

70
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,910
Take it.

71
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,590
Don't worry.

72
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,840
What is going on?

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,960
Xiuxiu.

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,820
Xiuxiu!

75
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,220
Set out now!

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,310
Xiuxiu!

77
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,820
What exactly happened, Mother?

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
Xiuxiu!

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,190
Mother...

80
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,160
What is this... Mother!

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,120
Mother, what's wrong?

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,720
Mother!

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,360
Mother, why is your head bleeding?

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,000
Why is this happening?

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,450
Why would such a misfortune

86
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,110
befall your poor sister?

87
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,980
Even if my blood drains out,

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,770
your sister won't come back.

89
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,770
My daughter Xiuxiu...

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,409
What a poor child...

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,950
Xiuxiu,

92
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,840
your maiden family
prepared this bag for you.

93
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,690
Xiuxiu?

94
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,040
Xiuxiu!

95
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,480
Xiuxiu!

96
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,070
Xiuxiu!

97
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,670
Where are you going, Xiuxiu?

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,160
Mr. Fei,

99
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,600
get out of the way.

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,870
Xiuxiu will be Feng Dajiao's bride.

101
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,120
This is her wedding sedan.

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,310
Wedding sedan?

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,290
Stop! Stop it now!

104
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,750
Mr. Fei,

105
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,480
true heroes never intercept
wedding sedans.

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,600
true heroes never intercept
wedding sedans.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You're breaking a big taboo.

108
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,560
Xiuxiu,

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,340
why are you marrying Feng Dajiao?

110
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,120
Mr. Fei,

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
don't be ridiculous.

112
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,340
You're already married to Susu.

113
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,280
What? You want to marry her sister too?

114
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
That would be an outrage.

115
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,870
Keep going. Go!

116
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,630
Head to the Feng Residence!

117
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,430
No. Don't go! Don't!

118
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,430
Stop it now!

119
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,800
Xiuxiu, tell me,

120
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,850
who made you marry Feng Dajiao?

121
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,310
Mr. Fei...

122
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,510
Xiuxiu!

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,390
Say something.

124
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,430
Tell him

125
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,390
you chose to marry Feng Dajiao
and got on the carriage

126
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,600
of your own accord!

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Nonsense!

128
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,160
Xiuxiu would never
volunteer to marry Feng Dajiao!

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,630
Xiuxiu,

130
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,270
tell me

131
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,070
-who forced you to marry Feng Dajiao.
-Mr. Fei...

132
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,830
Xiuxiu!

133
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,130
We're strangers from now on.

134
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,940
Please let me go.

135
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,670
Go!

136
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,800
Father.

137
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,600
Father,

138
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,190
why is Xiuxiu marrying Feng Dajiao?

139
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,190
I'm asking you.

140
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,270
Why is Xiuxiu marrying Feng Dajiao?

141
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,270
Did you force her?

142
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,920
I married into the Fei family
as you requested.

143
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,180
Did you go save Xiuxiu?

144
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,510
You were lying to me, weren't you?

145
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,070
You replaced Xiuxiu with me
because you feared

146
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,630
that Mrs. Fei would ask you to return

147
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,380
the betrothal gifts and that stupid land!

148
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,390
Do you even see us as your own daughters?

149
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,830
You didn't save Xiuxiu
from the bandits' lair.

150
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,770
Then you just gave me away
without hesitation!

151
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,370
We're valued
even less than dogs in your heart!

152
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,419
Uncle!

153
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,600
Uncle!

154
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,850
How did it go?

155
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,870
The matchmaker...

156
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,270
She has a message for you.

157
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,130
The bride is on her way here.

158
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,630
Good.

159
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,030
I'll cook noodles for you later.

160
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,330
O-Okay.

161
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,350
You proposed a marriage
on Dajiao's behalf?

162
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,530
Anything wrong with it?

163
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,200
How could you do that?

164
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,000
Did I do anything wrong?

165
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Look,

166
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,960
haven't I already told you about it?

167
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,090
What's the point of such nonsense now?

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,410
Xiuxiu will be our daughter-in-law soon.

169
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,270
How is Dajiao supposed to live with this?

170
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,180
What will people think of us?

171
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,880
Enough with the nagging.

172
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
Let's welcome the bride.

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,560
What?

174
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,880
Xiuxiu decided to marry Feng Dajiao,

175
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,530
got on the matchmaker's carriage

176
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,330
and just left?

177
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
Has the Young Master

178
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,280
learned the news yet?

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,270
The Young Master

180
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,720
ran into Miss Xiuxiu on the way.

181
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,980
Miss Xiuxiu said something harsh to him.

182
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,390
He was quite upset.

183
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,360
Then,

184
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,200
he headed to the riverside.

185
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,990
I thought he was going to...

186
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
But he is fine now.

187
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,330
He is crying by the river.

188
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,430
I thought I should come back
and inform you of that.

189
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,070
Madam,

190
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
what should we do now?

191
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,190
Where is Susu?

192
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,530
She's still in the Ning Residence.

193
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,840
Mother,

194
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,790
you can't let Xiuxiu marry Feng Dajiao.

195
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,910
Or she'll suffer.

196
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,050
Please ask my brother to bring her home.

197
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,110
Your brother went out

198
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,510
with anger this morning.

199
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,510
I don't know where he has gone,

200
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,910
or when he will be back.

201
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,530
My dearest daughter,

202
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,410
I've outlived my usefulness.

203
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm really useless.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Mother!

205
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,600
Mother, why are you slapping yourself?

206
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,150
Mother!

207
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,510
Why do you have to make a big fuss?

208
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,870
Do you want me dead or what?

209
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,210
You didn't rescue my sister.

210
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,330
I hate you!

211
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,430
Stop yelling.

212
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,020
Go back to the Fei Residence now.

213
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,650
I'm back. I'll stay here.

214
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,340
I won't go back to the Fei Residence.

215
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
I'm determined to be with my mother!

216
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,960
You must leave now!

217
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,750
Go back to the Fei Residence!

218
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,440
No way!

219
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,320
What are you doing?

220
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,030
What are you doing?

221
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm not going.

222
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,750
Mother!

223
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,440
Susu!

224
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,390
-Mother!
-Put on your shoes.

225
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,670
I'm not going...

226
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,150
Mother!

227
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,780
Mother,

228
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,540
don't go. Just stay.

229
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,320
Get some rest.

230
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,400
Father, Father!

231
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,080
Father, I beg you!

232
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,890
You've married into the Fei family.

233
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,960
If you are to die,

234
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,320
you'll have to die in the Fei Residence!

235
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,150
Father, I don't want to leave.

236
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,320
Father, I beg you to let me stay!

237
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,530
Father!

238
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,840
Father... Father...

239
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,430
You promised to relieve me
when Xiuxiu came back.

240
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,510
You lied to me!

241
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,420
I'm not going back to the Fei Residence,
Dad!

242
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,330
I'm abandoned

243
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,910
like a piece of trash now.

244
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,950
Mother... Mother...

245
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,090
Susu!

246
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,900
Silly girl, why are you crying here?

247
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,950
Sister-in-law, my father lied to me.

248
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,490
He didn't go save my sister at all.

249
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,200
I asked for an explanation,

250
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,910
but he just chased me away.

251
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,740
I'm a poor wretch.

252
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,200
Alright, stop crying.

253
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,500
Or your face will get chapped.

254
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,510
Come home with me.

255
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,050
Tell me everything.

256
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,800
I'll help you. Come on.

257
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,580
Is it true?

258
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,050
Why would I lie to you?

259
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,110
Let's go.

260
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,800
It's freezing cold.

261
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,750
Mrs. Feng!

262
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,390
Congratulations!

263
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,840
My goodness.

264
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,670
White dough?

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
My secret stash.

266
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,720
You came right in time.

267
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,990
I don't know what to do now.

268
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,630
I'm completely lost.

269
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,120
I always have your back.

270
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,250
I came as soon as I heard about the news.

271
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,000
We've been neighbors for over 20 years.

272
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,790
We're close friends, aren't we?

273
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,550
Forgo the pleasantries, alright?

274
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,120
Tell me,

275
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,750
how did things develop like this?

276
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,500
It's actually a good thing.

277
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,920
Xiuxiu is

278
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,430
different from her father Ning Xuexiang.

279
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,950
I heard that she had given enormous help

280
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,100
to those who rented her family's land.

281
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,240
Get those pessimistic thoughts
out of your head.

282
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,500
What should I tell Dajiao when he's back?

283
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,080
Maybe he will like Xiuxiu,

284
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,480
don't you think?

285
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,440
I hope so.

286
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,630
Has Tietou brought Dajiao back?

287
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,970
Not yet.

288
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,710
Our son's not home.
Shall we still welcome the bride?

289
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,150
Yes. What do you mean?

290
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,450
Hurry up.

291
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,790
Heat the stove and cook noodles.

292
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,480
Feng Er, Sister-in-law!

293
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,710
We're here to congratulate you!

294
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,960
Your son's getting married today, huh?

295
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,840
What a blessing. Right?

296
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,250
Sister-in-law,

297
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,120
why didn't you tell me
about the bride's arrival?

298
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,750
Yeah.

299
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,410
I got the news just now.

300
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Now is not too late to learn about it.

301
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,940
The bride will be here soon.

302
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,200
Er,

303
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,390
Miser Ning gave the bride
a substantial dowry,

304
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,360
including a lot of grains and land, right?

305
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,720
I-I'm not sure yet.

306
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,630
Er.

307
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,240
Er!

308
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,550
Who are

309
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,800
your next of kin?

310
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,000
In my opinion,

311
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,810
they must be your brothers.

312
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,720
When your life becomes better off,

313
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,190
don't forget your little brother.

314
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,720
We're raising two children

315
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
who are eager to be fed.

316
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,670
They are your nephews.

317
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,600
You're right.

318
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,180
What is there to worry?
Er won't forget about me.

319
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,320
-He won't.
-That's right.

320
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,720
Er won't forget about us.

321
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,280
My own...

322
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,320
Wait.

323
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,270
What did we say
when we split the household?

324
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,700
That we should only take care of

325
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,180
our own family?

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Er...

327
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,080
W-Why not just wipe it out of your mind?

328
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,360
Uncle! The bride...

329
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,800
The bride has arrived!

330
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,110
The bride has arrived.

331
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,440
We'll be right with her!

332
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,870
The bride is here!

333
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,120
Hurry up!

334
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,600
The bride is here!

335
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,330
Where is she?

336
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:06,870
Where?

337
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,600
Where is she?

338
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,480
There she is!

339
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,600
Pull up!

340
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,960
Here comes the bride!

341
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,440
Come on.

342
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
Where is Dajiao?

343
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,080
Why not tell him to come
and meet the bride?

344
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,750
Let's show the bride in first.

345
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,270
Sounds nice.

346
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,550
Give it to me.

347
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,630
Take the bag.

348
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
Xiuxiu!

349
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,630
We've arrived!

350
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,960
Let's go inside.

351
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,060
Watch your steps.

352
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,240
Here comes the bride!

353
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,200
Cheer up.

354
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,550
Careful,

355
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,150
New Bride.

356
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,790
This way.

357
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,840
Very good.

358
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,980
Make way. Make way!

359
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,010
Stay back!

360
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,070
You must be hungry, Susu.

361
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,750
I'll cook something nice for you
when we get home.

362
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,150
Your sister-in-law told me

363
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,680
you like steamed pork on lotus leaves,
right?

364
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,030
Will you make that for me?

365
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,790
I can only have steamed pork
on lotus leaves

366
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,390
on my birthday at home.

367
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,550
From now on, in the Fei family,

368
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,240
your favorite dishes will be presented
on the table every day.

369
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,600
Just tell me what you want to eat.

370
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,730
I'll do the cooking.

371
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,720
Do I even get to decide that?

372
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,670
Sure.

373
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,010
Sister-in-law,

374
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,030
I can't eat the Fei family's food.

375
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,030
As my mother said,

376
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,610
free food comes with strings attached.

377
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,510
If I accept any food from the Fei family,

378
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,910
I won't be able to go home.

379
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,270
Also,

380
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,910
my marriage with Wendian
must be cancelled soon.

381
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,710
Or my name will never be cleared.

382
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,320
I'm also hoping

383
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,340
to solve the problem as soon as possible.

384
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,170
Don't worry.

385
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,260
Everything will be fine.

386
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,500
Auntie's cooking is amazing.

387
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,730
What's the worth of her dowry?

388
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,440
Don't get me started.
Her mother brought it up with her father.

389
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,320
They must've given her 100 mu of land,
right?

390
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,070
I'm not finished yet.

391
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,070
Let's say it's less than 100 mu.

392
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,880
Then it should at least be 50, right?

393
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,360
At first, though reluctant,

394
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,240
Master Ning offered her 15 mu.

395
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,910
F-fifteen mu?

396
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,160
O-Only 15 mu?

397
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,960
Let me finish.

398
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,920
Is that 15 mu of land

399
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,480
in the west of the village?

400
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,680
That's right.

401
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,270
He meant 15 mu of land

402
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,470
near the well in the west of the village.

403
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,790
If that's the case...

404
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,590
Okay. Fine.

405
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,590
I'm fine with it.

406
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,690
I'll ask him for something else.

407
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,940
But your daughter-in-law declined.

408
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,590
She firmly refused it.

409
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,560
She declined?

410
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,480
What a silly girl!

411
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,800
It's like her head was hit by a bull.

412
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,890
That 15 mu of land is the best
in the entire village!

413
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,790
She refused it. What could I do?

414
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,070
Rejecting even a rice grain
of the Ning family,

415
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,480
she just hopped onto the carriage
and came here.

416
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,400
So she didn't bring land
or anything to us.

417
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,830
What an awful daughter-in-law!

418
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,590
What's the use of her now?

419
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,240
You don't want her now?
But she's already here.

420
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,880
C-Can we send her back?

421
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,230
This has cost you zero betrothal gift,
right?

422
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,740
You got a daughter-in-law
without spending a penny.

423
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,790
A real bargain, isn't it?

424
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,830
I'll take my leave!

425
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,750
My job was to bring the bride here,

426
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,880
not to send her back.

427
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
If you have any plans,

428
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,030
act as you see fit!

429
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,430
After hearing about Dajiao
from the matchmaker,

430
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,750
I decided to marry him.

431
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,270
But when I entered
the desolate Feng Residence,

432
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,550
which I was completely unfamiliar with,

433
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,930
I actually fell into panic.

434
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,750
That day, after waiting a long time,

435
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,960
I still didn't see Dajiao.

436
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,000
I began to feel
more and more disoriented.

437
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,820
Leaving the Ning family
that deeply disappointed me

438
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,180
was a correct decision.

439
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,680
But this place

440
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,830
is not my home after all.

441
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
In such a short time,

442
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,880
I've become the loneliest person
in the world.

443
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,550
I could feel the cold

444
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,720
all around me.

445
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,750
Have you found him?

446
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,160
No.

447
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Maybe the wolves caught him?

448
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,650
What are you talking about?

449
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,990
With Dajiao's strength,

450
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,520
he's the one catching wolves,

451
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,180
no way wolves could catch him.

452
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,750
Don't overthink it.

453
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,410
Didn't Tietou go look for him again?

454
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,710
If you ask me,

455
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,430
you should be worried about

456
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,510
the one inside.

457
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,400
The bride's been

458
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,640
waiting there for so long,
and still no sign of the groom.

459
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,110
That's just not right.

460
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,120
Why don't you go in
and chat with her for a bit?

461
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,240
Go.

462
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,480
You're better with words than I am.
You go!

463
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm not going.

464
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,810
Sister-in-law,

465
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,360
are you out of your mind?

466
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,790
How can the groom's father

467
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,920
go in and chat with the bride?

468
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,210
I'll go with you.

469
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,950
Let's go. Come on.

470
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,100
Let's go.

471
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,350
She didn't bring a dowry.

472
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,580
I'm not sure if she'll stay or not,

473
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,860
let alone sit and chat.

474
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,280
Don't move.

475
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,960
Stay put.

476
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,770
As the old saying goes,

477
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,430
"Good fortune comes when you sit."

478
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,640
The longer the bride sits,
the luckier she is.

479
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,300
Your mother-in-law is a good person.

480
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,510
From now on,

481
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,440
you'll be living together.

482
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,440
Miss Xiuxiu.

483
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,230
Why are you being so formal with her?

484
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,230
She's your daughter-in-law,
so you should call her by name.

485
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,190
Her name?

486
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,270
Xiuxiu.

487
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,510
Xiuxiu.

488
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,400
Are... are you tired?

489
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,140
Do you want some water?

490
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,360
Yes.

491
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,380
Oh my, I forgot it!

492
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,880
I forgot to boil water.

493
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,830
Right, by the way,

494
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,990
the matchmaker came to propose,

495
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,280
but unexpectedly,
she brought the bride over.

496
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,630
Your mother-in-law
panicked when she heard it.

497
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,160
I helped her

498
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,310
tidy up

499
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,620
this place earlier.

500
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,480
Have some water.

501
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,810
You can't just hand it to her like that.

502
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,230
At least pour it in a bowl.

503
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,040
Look how happy you are.

504
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,980
Here, drink.

505
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
The water is too cold, right?

506
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,410
It's raw water.

507
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,960
There's hot noodle soup in the kitchen.

508
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,400
Do you want some? I'll get it for you.

509
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,930
Yeah, right, noodle soup is good.

510
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,100
Xiuxiu,

511
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,660
you're so fair-skinned and delicate.

512
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,960
When you sit here,

513
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,220
you make the Fengs' shabby house brighter.

514
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,910
Is Dajiao back?

515
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,990
He'll be back soon.

516
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,880
Don't worry.

517
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,860
When did he leave?

518
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,820
Yesterday.

519
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,890
Where are you going?

520
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,960
I'm gong to find Dajiao.

521
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,550
Don't worry.

522
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,860
Niwei and Tietou went loooking for him.

523
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,680
Did they go to Chicken Ridge?

524
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,570
Why?

525
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,480
Isn't that where the bandits...

526
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,720
Here, it's still hot.

527
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,500
Drink it.

528
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,470
Is there anything to eat?

529
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,510
I'm hungry.

530
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,510
Yes, yes.

531
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,380
I'll cook noodles for you.

532
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,090
I'll go make it now, here, give it to me.

533
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,100
Poor girl,

534
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,510
she must've suffered a lot.

535
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,400
Did she say anything?

536
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,350
Yes.

537
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,570
What did she say?

538
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,300
She said she's hungry.

539
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,170
I'll cook noodles for her.

540
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,890
How dare she ask for food?

541
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,270
She hasn't done a thing yet,
and we're already feeding her?

542
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,680
She doesn't look like
a rich family's daughter.

543
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,200
Stop talking nonsense.

544
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,520
She looks like she's starving.

545
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,560
She can't even walk steadily.

546
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,880
Fine.

547
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,670
Let her eat.

548
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,200
Once she eats our food,

549
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,310
she's part of our family.

550
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,720
And since she's family,

551
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,030
she better pay back the land she owes us.

552
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,210
Let her stuff herself!

553
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,580
Oh my goodness.

554
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,560
Eat up. It'll warm you up.

555
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,800
We'll talk

556
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,130
after we finish the meal.

557
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,460
Here, drink some liquor

558
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,600
to get rid of the cold.

559
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,470
If I hadn't drunk last night,

560
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,600
I could've gone to the Ning Residence,

561
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,330
and asked about the situation.

562
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,830
If I...

563
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,820
if I had known earlier the Ning family
wouldn't pay to get her back,

564
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,620
even if I went broke,

565
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,070
I'd still have to save Xiuxiu back.

566
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,750
Xiuxiu must be desperate

567
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,350
to marry that Feng Dajiao.

568
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,310
That must be the case.

569
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,310
It's all my fault.

570
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,550
It's my fault too.

571
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
I shouldn't have trusted my father.

572
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,270
My sister must hate us both!

573
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
No one's to blame.

574
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,220
It's just her fate.

575
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,680
Help yourself.

576
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh my.

577
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,330
Xiuxiu really has an appetite.

578
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,440
She must've been hungry for days.

579
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,200
Do you want some more?

580
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,480
It's good to be full.

581
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,700
It's good to be full.

582
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,280
Where are you going?

583
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,140
I'm going to find Dajiao.

584
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,570
Don't go. Listen.

585
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,110
You're a girl.
Where could you find him?

586
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,880
Tietou and Niwei went to find him.

587
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,720
They said once they have news,
they'll come back.

588
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,610
Exactly.

589
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,160
A bride doesn't go find the groom.

590
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,970
You're just talking nonsense.

591
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,470
You're just a skinny girl.

592
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,340
How could you even find him?

593
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,240
I'll get straight to the point.

594
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,250
Don't get sick in your first week here.

595
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,640
If anything happens to you,

596
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,930
and you get sick,

597
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,720
I can't afford your treatment.

598
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,390
I'm not a rich man.

599
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,910
If you ask me for money,

600
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,200
we'll be the ones getting sick first.

601
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,530
Honey, watch your tone.

602
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,620
That old guy's words are rough, but true.

603
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,900
Let's go inside and rest.

604
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,140
Hurry, get inside.

605
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,360
Dajiao will come back
when you wake up.

606
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,790
-It's cold outside. Don't catch a cold.
-Have a rest inside.

607
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,480
Come on, let's get inside.

608
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,610
Right, come in and have a rest. Come on.

609
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,310
Xiuxiu,

610
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,550
sit there and rest.

611
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,890
Get on the bed-stove, warm up a bit.
Take off your shoes.

612
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,760
Try it.

613
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,990
That bed-stove is warm from head to toe.

614
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,360
Dajiao built the fire pit himself.

615
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,600
He also gathered the firewood

616
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,410
from the mountains.

617
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,710
To be honest,

618
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,290
my son Dajiao is a diligent kid.

619
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
He's good at everything.

620
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,480
At home or in the fields,

621
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,880
there's nothing he can't handle.

622
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,640
Uncle Feng!

623
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,350
Uncle Feng!

624
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,140
I got it.

625
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,190
I got it.

626
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,120
Silly Tiao's father

627
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,100
ran into Dajiao this morning

628
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,000
while setting rabbit traps.

629
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,300
Dajiao was taking someone into town.

630
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,430
Why?

631
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,680
I don't know.

632
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,460
I'm leaving.

633
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,240
That's a good news.

634
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,410
I'm also tired.

635
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,570
I'm going back.

636
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,840
Hold on, wait a moment.

637
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,840
Take these pancakes home.

638
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,700
Take them for the kids.

639
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,200
Go on, take them.

640
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,580
Thanks for your help!

641
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,620
Xiuxiu would never
volunteer to marry Feng Dajiao!

642
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,100
Xiuxiu,

643
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,800
tell me.

644
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,520
Who on earth made you marry Feng Dajiao?

645
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,350
Xiuxiu!

646
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,160
Xiu...

647
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,940
It's my fault.

648
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,750
It's all my fault.

649
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,470
Xiuxiu?

650
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,140
Is she asleep?

651
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,120
She's asleep.
She fell asleep right away.

652
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,380
Snap, just like that, she just dozed off.

653
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,610
She must be exhausted.

654
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,340
This girl is so pretty.

655
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,590
So what?

656
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,750
She's got terrible luck.

657
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,940
You tell me,

658
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,190
how did she get violated by bandits?

659
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,840
Enough, she's married in now.

660
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,190
If others don't judge her,

661
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,790
why should you nag about her?

662
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,830
You run this house,

663
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,510
making big or small decisions.

664
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,370
And our son's marriage is a huge deal,

665
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,200
yet you took her in without asking him.

666
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,720
When he comes back,
let's see what you'll say.

667
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,110
Step by step.

668
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,450
Not a single step

669
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,970
went as I expected.

670
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,870
How many times have I told you?

671
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,750
"Bargains come with trouble."

672
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,030
Look at you now.

673
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,510
If Dajiao comes back

674
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
and says

675
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,050
he doesn't want her,

676
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,640
then... what will you do?

677
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,140
Send her back?

678
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,560
That way, you'll lose all your reputation.

679
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,410
What are you talking about?

680
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,810
Reputation can't feed you.

681
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,350
I'm thinking,

682
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,620
in a couple of days,

683
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,480
our son

684
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,240
can take her to visit her family.

685
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,750
Maybe they'll give us

686
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,840
that land.

687
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,510
If our son is persuasive enough,

688
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,060
by that time,

689
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,750
it could be more than 15 mu of land.

690
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,550
Let's not talk about nonsense now.

691
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,820
I've heard enough.

692
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,520
This matter

693
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,450
is for Dajiao to decide.

694
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,990
Uncle, Aunt.

695
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
I brought Dajiao home.

696
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,630
It's so cold out there.

697
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,230
Why are you sitting outside?

698
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,770
Where have you been?

699
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,830
What's wrong, Mother?

700
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,030
Why didn't you stay in the room?

701
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,640
You scared your father and me.

702
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,640
I'm an adult, what's there to worry about?

703
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,440
Hold on... what's with
all the decorations here?

704
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,560
W-what's going on?

705
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,510
Is there anything to celebrate?

706
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,480
Since you asked,

707
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,680
I'd say something big happened at home.

708
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,480
Your father got you a...

709
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,790
It's a good news, a good thing.

710
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,780
Go take a look, hurry up.

711
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,440
What good news could there be?

712
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,960
Good news?

713
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,050
What happened?

714
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,670
What's going on?

715
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,000
What happened, Dajiao?

716
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,670
Why is Xiuxiu lying on my bed-stove?

717
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,020
My son.

718
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,440
That's...

719
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,070
what it is.

720
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
Now I just need your honest answer.

721
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,070
Will you take her as your wife

722
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,280
or not?

723
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,360
Wii you

724
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,860
let her stay or not?

725
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,590
Yeah.

726
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,560
If you don't like her, I'll talk to her

727
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,800
when she wakes up.

728
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,770
Then we'll send her back.

729
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,880
Her own father didn't want her.

730
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,040
The Fei family didn't want her either.

731
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,470
I'll keep her.

732
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,690
No matter what, I'll keep her.

733
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,710
Son,

734
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,420
why do you want her to stay?

735
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,970
Because I like her.

736
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,840
You...

737
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,480
you probably don't know, right?

738
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,030
She was violated by bandits.

739
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,630
Mother,

740
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,620
it's not her fault.

741
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,610
Don't mention it again.

742
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,030
Every time I hear it,

743
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,680
it just makes my heart ache.

744
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,860
Do you really like her?

745
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,440
I have nothing more to say.

746
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,710
My son,

747
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,010
when she married in,

748
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,170
the matchmaker said

749
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,510
her father

750
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,670
would give 15 mu of land as her dowry,

751
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,960
but she refused.

752
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,860
If you want to keep her,

753
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,740
fine.

754
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
But at least,

755
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,760
no matter what,

756
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,960
we have to get back the 15 mu of land.

757
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,920
Otherwise,

758
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,720
this marriage is a loss.

759
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,430
Father,

760
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
she's already been through so much.

761
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Don’t you even

762
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,060
have any heart left?

763
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,070
Dajiao.

764
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,220
Why are you still here?

765
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,780
I need to talk to you.

766
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,710
What is it?

767
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,260
Think carefully.

768
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,300
What are you trying to say?

769
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,630
Xiuxiu...

770
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,710
was violated by bandits.

771
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,710
So what?

772
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,670
What's wrong?

773
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,130
Why are you so agitated?

774
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,580
Dajiao,

775
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,500
did you always have feelings for Xiuxiu?

776
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,110
Tietou,

777
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,370
I like Xiuxiu.

778
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,530
I've liked her since I was a kid.

779
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,330
Back then,

780
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,360
I couldn't reach her.

781
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,480
Now, no one wants her.

782
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,750
If she's willing to marry me,

783
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,650
I'll take it as a blessing

784
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,050
from God.

785
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
Dajiao, why are you
doing this to yourself?

786
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,630
You only see Xiuxiu's beauty,

787
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,960
you have no idea how much

788
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,290
suffering lying ahead.

789
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,840
Rich families

790
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,760
aren't like us.

791
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,550
Their views and thoughts

792
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,080
aren't the same as ours too.

793
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,510
It's hard to explain.

794
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,840
Anyway,

795
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,440
they look down on us.

796
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,040
They don't treat us as human.

797
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,630
I don't care.

798
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,810
Wendian.

799
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
Wendian.

800
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Wendian.

801
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:13,920
Wendian.

802
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,100
You're awake. Go make something
to eat, anything will do.

803
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,230
Anything will do?

804
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,490
It's her first meal.
We should cook something decent.

805
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,340
Decent food?

806
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,240
Did she give us her dowry?

807
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,790
So you're saying
if she didn't bring her dowry,

808
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,430
you wouldn't feed her

809
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,800
or treat her well?

810
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,300
How about this?

811
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,660
I'll borrow a fish later

812
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,840
and fry it up for her.

813
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,490
What are you thinking?

814
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,810
She's from a rich family,

815
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,510
you think that'll impress her?

816
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,110
Fine, I'll check the market later.

817
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,920
That's more like it.

818
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,230
Let her eat,

819
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,130
then we'll go get the land.

820
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,590
Xiuxiu,

821
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,340
where are you going?

822
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,550
Why are you holding a bundle?

823
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,670
My son...

824
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,800
doesn't want you to stay?

825
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,770
I just want to wash my face

826
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,420
and brush my teeth.

827
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Brush your teeth?

828
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,420
We don't have that habit here.

829
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,750
Didn't she bring the habit here?

830
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,020
You should go to the market now.

831
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,860
How do you brush your teeth?

832
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,940
I need some warm water.

833
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,720
Okay.

834
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,380
That's new. Brushing teeth?

835
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,110
Here's your warm water.

836
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,800
I...

837
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,880
I also...

838
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,760
need some salt.

839
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,510
You want to drink salty water?

840
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,590
I'll add the salt in here.

841
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,400
No, no.

842
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,190
I forgot to bring my tooth powder,

843
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,840
so I'll brush with salt.

844
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,440
I'll go get it.

845
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,510
Wait a moment.

846
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,670
You brush your teeth with salt?

847
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,790
How many times a day?

848
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,770
Twice a day, morning and night.

849
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,750
How much salt is that?

850
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,520
Just brush your teeth.

851
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,800
Don't mind him.

852
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,320
Come here.

853
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,590
What's wrong with her?

854
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,900
Where did the salt come from?

855
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,240
I traded eggs for it.

856
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,410
Where did the eggs come from?

857
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,780
The hens laid them.

858
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:32,790
Where did the hens come from?

859
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,990
We fed them with rice.

860
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,040
If she keeps using salt like that,

861
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,230
how can we even afford it?

862
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,320
She's just wasting our salt!

863
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,380
Stop complaining.

864
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,430
Splash it out.

865
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,550
It'll dry soon.

866
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,490
Just splash it.

867
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,210
Dajiao.

868
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,460
I only found out last night

869
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,220
that you hadn't come home.

870
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,880
I was worried...

871
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,020
you were taken by bandits.

872
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,680
Let's not talk about this now.

873
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,930
Why are you here?

874
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,740
Didn't you go see Fei Wendian?
