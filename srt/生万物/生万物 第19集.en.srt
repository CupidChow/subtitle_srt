[Episode 19]

3
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,080
Come with me!

4
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,530
Xiuxiu! You're finally back.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,060
-Mother.
-Susu is here.

6
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,940
Mother.
Any news about Dajiao?

7
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,940
Your second uncle has been released.

8
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,870
He said he last saw Dajiao
leaving with Humpback Guo.

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Humpback Guo?

10
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,350
Xiuxiu!

11
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,580
Xiuxiu!

12
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,800
Xiuxiu! Xiu!

13
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,190
-Xiuxiu.
-Xiu!

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,420
Xiu, what's wrong?

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,120
Xiu! Come on! Let's carry her inside!

16
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,520
Xiu!

17
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,850
-Xiuxiu!
-Xiu.

18
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,770
Is she alright?

19
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,010
She'll be fine.

20
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,920
It's just exhaustion from stress lately.

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,280
Congratulations, Auntie!

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,560
Your family is about to grow—

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,290
she's pregnant!

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,829
Really!

25
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,520
The Feng family will have an heir?

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,910
Oh, Dajiao… Where are you?

27
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,660
Why are you never home
when good news comes?

28
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,680
Take care on your way.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,710
Xiuxiu, you fainted earlier

30
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,590
and wouldn't wake up.

31
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,150
Auntie called the doctor.

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,010
Xiuxiu.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,190
It's a pregnancy!

34
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,680
You're really with child!

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,710
You can't move now! Don't move!

36
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,800
You're pregnant!

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
You—

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,650
how could you not know,
without your period on time?

39
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,500
Mother,

40
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,290
my period came on time,

41
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,560
but then stopped abruptly
after a very short flow. I thought...

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,240
Merciful heavens!

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,590
With that glow, it's probably a boy—

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
nine chances in ten!

45
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,910
Auntie, you're miraculous!

46
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,430
How can you tell it's a boy already?

47
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,079
Not me—it's our ancestors' wisdom!

48
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,210
You're pregnant, Xiu!

49
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,370
I'll go cook millet porridge.

50
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,530
Mother... Mother,

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,700
earlier

52
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,030
you said...

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,970
Dajiao left with Humpback Guo?

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,930
Is that true?

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,190
Your Second Uncle was released—
he's the one who said it.

56
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,250
When the press-gang came for Dajiao,

57
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,840
Humpback Guo claimed,

58
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,800
"He's my worker, deaf and dumb,"

59
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,280
and they let Dajiao go.

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,720
Then why hasn't Dajiao

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
sent word home?

62
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,110
I can't rest—I'll ask Second Uncle myself!

63
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,040
You stay in that bed!

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,470
Mother, I...

65
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,140
Isn't it enough that we've got a lead?

66
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,580
Your Second Uncle said he'd ask around!

67
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,520
Fine.

68
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,530
Don't you dare move.

69
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,510
Auntie, I'm hungry too.

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
There's plenty for you, child, plenty!

71
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,480
Xiuxiu, don't be afraid!

72
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,360
Dajiao will send word soon.

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,870
Xiuxiu,

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,520
what does being pregnant really feel like?

75
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,120
Silly girl!

76
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,080
Right now I'm just anxious—
so anxious I could die.

77
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,510
I don't even know how it feels.

78
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,440
It's okay. Easy.

79
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,820
This is my first time
being so far away from home.

80
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,800
Far?

81
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,950
We're not even halfway yet.

82
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,530
We're heading for
those great waters up ahead.

83
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,430
Just wait—

84
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,390
the farther we go,
the smoother it will feel.

85
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,630
Even the air

86
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,270
will turn damp and thick.

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,380
I've seen the Shu River flood before.

88
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,450
It was terrifying.

89
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,560
The Shu River's nothing
compared to the sea.

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,950
Think of it—thousands of rivers
like the Shu

91
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,150
all pouring into one.

92
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,390
Hey, have you ever heard about

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,060
my ancestor, Guo Gangliu?

94
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,800
He robbed the rich to feed the poor,
a legend across the land.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
But one thing—

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,180
his martial arts? Never passed down.

97
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,310
Why not?

98
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,190
He grew tired of the vendettas,

99
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,190
the bloodshed.

100
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,920
Refused to teach
my great-grandfather a single move.

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,190
Just raised him
as an honest salt porter.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
Even his famed steel blade

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,070
was buried with him.

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,460
But thanks to his reputation,

105
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,750
my great-grandfather,
grandfather, and father—

106
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,240
all salt porters—

107
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,920
never faced trouble on the road.

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,159
Died of old age,

109
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,270
every one.

110
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,950
To this day,

111
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,070
the wide world still whispers his name.

112
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,370
So listen, Dajiao:

113
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,830
no fear! Even bandits

114
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,070
would show me, Guo Guiyao, some respect.

115
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
Then why's everyone in the village

116
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,120
call you Humpback?

117
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,630
The name is Guo Guiyao.

118
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,980
Gui as in noble,

119
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,160
Yao as in bring glory to our ancestors.

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
No idea how it got twisted into that.

121
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,780
Well? What do you think?

122
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,040
Such a huge river!

123
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,870
Are you daft?

124
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,720
I've been telling you all this way!

125
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,450
It's the sea,

126
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,500
the great sea!

127
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,270
So vast...

128
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,720
How nice
if only this were farmland instead!

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,750
We could plant

130
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
endless crops!

131
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,870
This is the fisherman's land.

132
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,630
Better than soil—

133
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,780
it's teeming with fish, shrimp,

134
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,250
and the salt we seek!

135
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,270
Come, try it!

136
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,659
Come on here!

137
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,220
It's cool.

138
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,560
Try it.

139
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,640
Taste it! It's super sweet!

140
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,160
It's salty!

141
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,790
I'll meet with the local salt merchants.

142
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,130
You explore the town.

143
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,800
Tonight I'll take you to the Song House.

144
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,280
Prepare to be amazed!

145
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,630
How much for this washbasin?

146
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,760
Two silver dollars!

147
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,909
Ah, you've got

148
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,110
fine taste, brother!

149
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,360
It's fresh stock

150
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,040
from Shanxi.

151
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,870
You can still smell the lacquer!

152
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,280
See how it shines!

153
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,800
Could you hold it for me?

154
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,270
I'm short on cash today.

155
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,710
I'll leave a deposit

156
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,950
and return tomorrow.

157
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,110
Very well,
but the deposit's non-refundable!

158
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,630
Dajiao,

159
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,960
I'll show you

160
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,750
the finest opera singer in 10 miles!

161
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,300
♪ Don't you ever forget me ♪

162
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,500
♪ I hold you in my heart always ♪

163
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,360
Guo Guiyao, it's been so long!

164
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,120
And you've brought a new face!

165
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,080
Dajiao, this is Lulu.

166
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,810
He can't speak.

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Really?

168
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,900
Such a nice-looking guy...

169
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,030
deaf and mute?

170
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,970
What a pity.

171
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,150
Aye,

172
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,429
denied life's pleasures!

173
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,840
So,

174
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,720
any new songs?

175
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,970
Not that your ears deserve them!

176
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,720
Yes, we do!

177
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,510
We've got "The Embroidered Pouch."
Do you want it?

178
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:54,970
Sing it.

179
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,430
♪ In the maiden's chamber she embroiders ♪

180
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,480
Enjoy.

181
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,610
I'll take my leave.

182
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,630
You lied to me?

183
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
You really thought

184
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,220
I'd bring a deaf-mute? Well...

185
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,600
No one's ever heard my songs
without paying.

186
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,360
I never asked you to sing.

187
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,040
You listened—now pay.

188
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,400
Why not just go rob?

189
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,220
Dajiao!

190
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,310
I'm here listening.

191
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,130
How is it, Xiuxiu? Any news?

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,030
Second Uncle hasn't received

193
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,600
any word from Dajiao yet.

194
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,030
See? Just wait at home.

195
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,910
When there's news,

196
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,520
Second Uncle will definitely send Kebi
to tell us.

197
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Without definite news,

198
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,790
I can't rest easy.

199
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,890
Xiuxiu, where's your snack basket?
I can't find it.

200
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,750
I don't have one.

201
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,670
You don't even have
a snack basket anymore?

202
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,910
Are you hungry?

203
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,360
Wait here, I'll get you something.

204
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,240
Here, eat.

205
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,930
With your brother-in-law away,

206
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,360
there's extra at dinner.

207
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,560
You've been eating just this for dinner?

208
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Silly me,

209
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,430
wait a moment...

210
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,120
No wonder you're getting so thin.

211
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,630
Here, dip it in.

212
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Go on, eat!

213
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,420
That's right, eat!

214
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,270
I have sinned.

215
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,970
I've failed.
I've dishonored the Fei ancestors.

216
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,120
I can't let our family line

217
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,490
die with me.

218
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Is your back sore?

219
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,300
It's unbearable.

220
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,390
These morning sickness spells are fierce.

221
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,520
Let me get you water!

222
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,270
Xiuxiu!

223
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,990
Elder sister!

224
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,090
Xiuxiu!

225
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,030
A message—from Dajiao!

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,060
The messenger said

227
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,440
Dajiao joined Humpback Guo's salt caravan

228
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,780
to evade conscription.
He'll return in a bit

229
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,980
but says not to worry.

230
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,750
This way,

231
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,720
he avoided the press-gang too!

232
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,310
See? I told you Dajiao was resourceful!

233
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,370
I knew he'd be fine.

234
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,570
Thank you so much, Kebi!

235
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,230
No worries!

236
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,380
I'm off, Xiuxiu.

237
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,670
Uncle,

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,930
I'm heading out.

239
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,670
Go lie down.

240
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,280
After all that running around today—
just look at you.

241
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,570
I was thinking that...

242
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,660
Surely Heaven

243
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,870
wouldn't be so cruel.

244
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,010
First Xiuxiu finally conceives,

245
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,630
and now our Dajiao vanishes.

246
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,900
We can't lose one while gaining another...

247
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,020
Enough of your nonsense.

248
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,330
Go make Xiuxiu an egg

249
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,680
instead of standing around gossiping.

250
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,280
Egg?

251
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,550
You're suggesting an egg?

252
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,140
Haven't you seen

253
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,800
how pale she's been from vomiting?

254
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,630
Besides,

255
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,080
that baby needs nourishment.

256
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,030
Fine, fine—I'll boil an egg.

257
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,560
Just one.

258
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,340
A single egg is plenty.

259
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,970
Better hurry before he changes his mind...

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,910
Xiuxiu!

261
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,790
Xiuxiu.

262
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,510
Father.

263
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,070
Your father insisted on boiling this.

264
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,750
Said you've been too sick—

265
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,100
all that vomiting has left you
with nothing in your stomach.

266
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,640
It's... still hot.

267
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,810
I'll eat it in my room.

268
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,870
Thank you, Mother.

269
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,020
Thank you, Father!

270
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,030
Xiuxiu! What's that?

271
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,630
An egg? For me?

272
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,910
It's too hot—we'll eat inside.

273
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,860
We can eat it here too!

274
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,890
Inside. Now.

275
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,300
I—

276
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,430
that—

277
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,000
I—

278
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,300
you—that's not—

279
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,960
What're you doing?
Practicing mill-grinding?

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,720
Mill-grinding?

281
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,450
Egg! The egg!

282
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,200
You watched me give it to her!

283
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,200
My grandson's nutrition—

284
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,400
wasted on her sister!

285
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,100
She's probably having it right now!

286
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,030
I'll just boil another—

287
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,750
Stop!

288
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,850
Don't waste it!

289
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,280
Eggs don't grow on trees!

290
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,710
Too hot? Let me peel it for you.

291
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,540
It's fine, Xiuxiu.

292
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,090
I don't mind hot eggs.

293
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,690
Remember when we were kids?

294
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,080
You and Kejin would still be peeling yours

295
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,750
while I'd already

296
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,030
swallowed mine whole.

297
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
Mother always said I had a gourmet's luck—

298
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,080
that I was born to eat,

299
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,150
never missing a bite
when there's good food around.

300
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,670
If mom were still here,

301
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,320
she'd be so happy

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
about my pregnancy.

303
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,440
She'd be bustling
about making preparations by now.

304
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,060
So good!

305
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,550
Don't choke.

306
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,000
Want some?

307
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,270
For heaven's sake, it's just one egg!

308
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,240
Do you want the whole village
laughing at us?

309
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,080
Laugh at what?

310
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,720
She's just like

311
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,720
her pop-eyed father!

312
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,790
All they know about
is eating and drinking!

313
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,200
That nutrition was for my grandson!

314
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,960
My grandson didn't get any!

315
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:42,640
Enough!

316
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,870
What are your parents-in-law
arguing about?

317
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,960
Nothing important.

318
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,670
She's not pregnant.

319
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,490
The Fei family might not
want her back anymore!

320
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,210
Coming here every day—

321
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,630
how much can we take?

322
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,040
Like father, like daughter—

323
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,720
both good-for-nothing leeches!

324
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,560
They...

325
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,100
they said I was like...

326
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,190
Choking? It's nothing!

327
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,890
Xiuxiu!

328
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,360
Why didn't you tell me
this egg was meant for you?

329
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Yours, mine—what's the difference?
It's just an egg.

330
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,100
The old folks

331
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,260
have always been frugal—

332
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,530
don't take it to heart.

333
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,210
Here.

334
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,870
-Have some water.
-Oh my God. Like father, like daughter.

335
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,140
My grandson's egg!

336
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,320
His egg!

337
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,860
What happened to these walls?

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Xiuxiu,

339
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,610
are you home?

340
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,970
I've come for Susu.

341
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,480
Don't be afraid—

342
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,200
I'm here.

343
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,480
Susu,

344
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,670
which room are you in?

345
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,570
Where...

346
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,030
Xiuxiu...

347
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,310
I've come to apologize.

348
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,910
This is unexpected!

349
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,350
Mrs. Fei,

350
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,210
why would you apologize
the moment you arrive?

351
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,080
Ah, Mrs. Fei!

352
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,670
Come inside—

353
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,960
No need.

354
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,870
I'm just here for Susu.

355
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
We've troubled you these past days.

356
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,230
Mrs. Fei.

357
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,180
I'm afraid Susu

358
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,190
isn't returning with you today.

359
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,930
I still remember yesterday at your gate—

360
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,480
how you and Father

361
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
were arguing over

362
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,340
sending her away...

363
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,200
leaving my sister stranded
like discarded goods.

364
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Even if the pregnancy was false,

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,050
she acted out of childish ignorance—

366
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,330
not malice.

367
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,630
Besides,

368
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,400
she's a human being,

369
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,950
your family's daughter-in-law—

370
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,260
not some breeding tool!

371
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,080
Not to mention the fact
that she may yet bear children.

372
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,340
Even if she never does,

373
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,000
that's no reason

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
to cast her out like this.

375
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,270
Xiuxiu,

376
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,330
you're Susu's own sister.

377
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,030
With your mother gone,

378
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,440
I understand—

379
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,680
of course you'd want to stand up for her.

380
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,540
But listen:

381
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,270
I never drove Susu out.

382
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,119
She left the Fei Residence on her own.

383
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,550
I was ill—truly didn't know.

384
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,319
Since we're speaking frankly...

385
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,250
I don't mind telling you a bit more.

386
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,349
Your father

387
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,750
only used Susu to spite me

388
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,410
over the Farmers' Association feud.

389
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,760
Harsh as it sounds,

390
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,640
to him, a daughter's worth

391
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,960
isn't gold.

392
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,520
Sending her back?

393
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,880
Just dung flung

394
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,720
at my head.

395
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,680
For years,

396
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,810
I've held this household together

397
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,960
alone—

398
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,530
everyone's witnessed it.

399
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,850
If I tolerate this once,

400
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,650
it'll be twice, thrice...

401
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,200
I can't!

402
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,720
Yes, Susu

403
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,640
suffered unfairly.

404
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,590
In truth, I thank you.

405
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,590
Had you not taken her that day,

406
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,430
I'd have faced

407
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,650
greater disgrace.

408
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,270
Mrs. Fei,

409
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,610
the unfairness is the least of it.

410
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,990
I won't have my sister

411
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,310
crawl back to bow forever
at the Fei family,

412
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,970
swallowing every salted slur

413
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,720
tossed her way.

414
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,070
Xiuxiu.

415
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,490
You wound me saying that.

416
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,580
Regardless of how Susu
married into the Fei family,

417
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,640
let her search her heart and testify:

418
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,510
From the day she entered our family

419
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,200
have we not provided
every material comfort

420
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,270
and daily provision
of the highest standard?

421
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,830
Whether Wendian was home or not,

422
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,830
we never treated her poorly!

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,830
If we wanted her back

424
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
just to demean her,

425
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,510
would I bother coming personally?

426
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,480
Am I right?

427
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,640
Ahem, Xiuxiu,

428
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,070
mind your tongue.

429
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,070
Don't meddle

430
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,750
in other people's affairs.

431
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,790
Mrs. Fei,

432
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,920
you're welcome to take her if—

433
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,630
I took in my wronged sister.

434
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,970
If my sister refuses to return,

435
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,460
I'll support her till my last breath!

436
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,260
Till your last breath?

437
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,440
Xiuxiu.

438
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,320
Stop talking!

439
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,000
Sister-in-law.

440
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,720
Do you have

441
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,650
a silver dollar?

442
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,250
Of course!

443
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,120
Qing,

444
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:17,730
quick!

445
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,680
Is this enough?

446
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,370
Thank you.

447
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,200
Uncle Feng Er,

448
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
this repays your egg.

449
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Should buy a whole basket
for your precious grandson.

450
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,450
Xiuxiu,

451
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,480
don't worry.

452
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,740
I won't live swallowing insults!

453
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,460
Sister-in-law, I'll return with you.

454
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,980
Qing! Here!

455
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,010
Take this, quick!

456
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,590
Xiuxiu,

457
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,770
we'll be off now!

458
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,350
Let's go.

459
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,140
We're leaving!

460
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,520
Leaving? Good, good!

461
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,250
Our apologies for the trouble!

462
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
So... did they feed you well these days?

463
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,290
The food was fine. Just never enough.

464
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,510
Now that Mrs. Fei—
there's a formidable woman.

465
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,730
She swept in like a spring gale.

466
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,170
Did she outright say anything?
Not a word.

467
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,400
Yet everything was said,

468
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
and done.

469
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,540
Frankly? I'd have followed her home too.

470
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,460
Hurry up!

471
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,690
Move it!

472
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,810
What's the rush?

473
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,010
What do you mean by "what's the rush"?

474
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,630
The salt's baking in the sun!

475
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,980
Why get up so early?

476
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,640
From now on, no questions—

477
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
just follow.

478
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,880
Dajiao,

479
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,350
this is my local helper, Xiaohu.

480
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,420
The stunning Lulu from yesterday
is his sister

481
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,900
Xiaohu.

482
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,640
Dajiao.

483
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,620
Dajiao—

484
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Jiao as in feet.

485
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,970
Dajiao,

486
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,400
why feet?

487
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,430
I run fast.

488
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,510
Run fast?

489
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,440
How fast?

490
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
Even rabbits can't catch me.

491
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,170
Seriously?

492
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,350
Why would I lie?

493
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,610
Enough chatter—

494
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,790
this boat

495
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,330
leaves with the tide.

496
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,240
Onboard, now!

497
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,040
This one here,

498
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
quick, quick!

499
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,830
Follow! Move it!

500
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,920
Honestly,

501
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,610
you're a grown man.

502
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,530
Can't you handle a little chop?

503
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,660
We haven't even started work,

504
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,260
and you're already seasick!

505
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,480
Here,

506
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,200
Dajiao—

507
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,970
puke in this!

508
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,390
You'll feel better after.

509
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's sit

510
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,580
where it's breezy.

511
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,920
Toll time!

512
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
Get your coins ready!

513
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,750
What toll?

514
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,720
It's a passage fee.

515
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,230
Think of it as... a ticket for clean salt.

516
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,800
Clean salt?

517
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,760
You know nothing about it, do you?

518
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,090
Is this your first time?

519
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,590
Pay this,

520
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,720
and we reach the salt flats smooth.

521
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,170
Then, you'll grab clean salt
with no taxes, no levies.

522
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:09,810
Get it now?

523
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,800
Grab?

524
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,780
Dropping anchor—shore's close!

525
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,040
Move fast when we land,

526
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,430
grab all you can!

527
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,320
Landing now!

528
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,340
Get ready!

529
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:36,920
Go!

530
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,730
Move! Hurry!

531
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,340
Move! Hurry!

532
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,800
Dajiao.

533
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,550
Move it!

534
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,380
Better now?

535
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Work brisk

536
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
at the salt flats.

537
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,920
Move!

538
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,420
Standard drill:

539
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,070
enter front gate, exit back—

540
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,200
our contact waits.

541
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,160
You've one pipe-smoke's time.

542
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,270
If patrols catch us,

543
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,400
we're both dead.

544
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,750
Other rules?

545
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,620
You know them!

546
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,270
Listen up, newcomers!

547
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,240
Only loose salt—

548
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,270
no full bags.

549
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,640
Officials count those.

550
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,030
Fill your gear

551
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
and scram!

552
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:13,960
Follow me!

553
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,440
Dajiao, keep up.

554
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,040
Hurry up!

555
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,050
Quickly!

556
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,590
Move it!

557
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,600
Hurry!

558
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,240
Come on!

559
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,830
Go!

560
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,560
Let's go!

561
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,070
Dajiao,

562
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,230
help me with this sack—

563
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,160
You pack slow—

564
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm hauling this out!

565
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,680
Xiaohu?

566
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,350
Xiaohu?

567
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,070
What's wrong?

568
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,170
Dajiao, I've twisted my ankle!

569
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,000
I'll carry it.

570
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,040
Pass it to me.

571
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,830
Is it serious?

572
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,370
I'm okay. I'll be fine in a bit.

573
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,300
Keep up quickly!

574
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,790
Let's move!

575
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,790
Go! Go!

576
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,050
Dajiao,
are you managing alright with that?

577
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,790
Move it!

578
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,990
Get on! Get on!

579
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,640
Quickly!

580
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,640
Freeze!

581
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,200
I said freeze!

582
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,030
Don't run!

583
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,200
Xiaohu—it's Xiaohu!

584
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,230
That greedy fool!

585
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,180
Cast off! Now! Don't leave him!

586
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,340
Xiaohu!

587
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,480
Dump the salt!

588
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,440
Run!

589
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,740
Run! Hurry!

590
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,630
Xiaohu!

591
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,830
Where are you going?

592
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,590
To save Xiaohu!

593
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,400
You madman?

594
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,730
Don't sail! Wait—

595
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,720
I've got a plan!

596
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,510
Sail!

597
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,000
Xiaohu!

598
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,640
Sail now!

599
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Xiaohu!

600
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,490
What were you thinking?

601
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,440
Xiaohu was caught by the authority!

602
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Why didn't you—?

603
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,960
If it were me,

604
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,380
would you abandon me too?

605
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,800
I brought you out whole—

606
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,950
I'll bring you back whole.

607
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,800
Then why not Xiaohu?

608
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,440
Enough of Xiaohu!

609
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,180
You met him at dawn—

610
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,190
quit acting like blood brothers!

611
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,500
I see it now—

612
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,830
this whole time,

613
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,550
you've been spinning tales.

614
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,510
That ancestor of yours, Guo Gangliu?

615
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,510
Pure fiction, wasn't he?

616
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,600
Let me spell it out: Xiaohu's fine.

617
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,440
He's been in and out
of that Salt Patrol jail

618
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,550
several times.

619
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,300
He'll be out in a couple of days.

620
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,000
That's all part of the earnings.

621
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
He's very familiar with the guards!

622
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,080
Familiar?

623
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,590
Then why did they beat him so brutally?

624
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,660
You're so naive.
Don't they have to make it look real?

625
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,190
The Salt Patrol
flies the emperor's banner,

626
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,570
but they're bandits in uniform.

627
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,610
They run

628
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,880
this smuggling ring.

629
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,710
And Xiaohu's got his sister looking out.

630
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,980
So quit your worrying.

631
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,920
Guo Guiyao says no rescue needed—

632
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,790
Xiaohu will walk free in days.

633
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,690
But every time
I close my eyes, I see him...

634
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,120
and I still owe him two sacks of salt.

635
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,910
I must find a way to save him.

636
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,240
Guo's right, truth be told.

637
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,550
My brother just hit a streak of bad luck

638
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,010
getting caught this time.

639
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,720
Before, I'd always bail him out—

640
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,120
just slip the Salt Patrol

641
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
a few silver coins.

642
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,250
But when he gets out,

643
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,400
he scolds me for wasting money.

644
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,860
"Wait a few days," he says.

645
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,110
Yet you... you're no kin to us,

646
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,200
but here you are,
kindness thicker than blood.

647
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,110
You're truly our family's savior.

648
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,770
No, no—don't say such things.

649
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,890
Thank you.

650
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,350
My Dajiao.

651
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,550
where've you gone now?

652
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,030
So, how's my plan?

653
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,270
Once we breach the entrance
of Ox Temple Village,

654
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,440
Miser Ning's residence
will be ripe for plucking—

655
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,100
like taking candy from a baby!

656
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,880
Seven hundred acres of wealth—

657
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,160
silver, gold,

658
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,080
all yours for the taking!

659
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,420
She slipped through our fingers once...

660
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,960
that failure

661
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,830
gnaws at me still.

662
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,750
You sure this isn't

663
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,400
another wild tale?

664
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Everyone knows

665
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,700
the old fortress is

666
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,400
easy to defend but hard to attack.

667
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,070
Besides,

668
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,310
his son's team is armed

669
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,510
with hunting rifles.

670
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,760
That's why

671
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Da Zong and Lao Jiu

672
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
go in with me first.

673
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
The rest of you, wait in the backwoods.

674
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,030
We'll scout the route,

675
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,240
then signal you with wooden clappers.

676
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,900
Then, you sneak in after dark.

677
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,680
Once inside,

678
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,730
take down Miser Ning first.

679
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,330
With him as our pawn,

680
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,040
even his..

681
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,570
rifle-toting son

682
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,000
won't dare act.

683
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,070
After securing the place,

684
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,750
we demand a ransom

685
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,950
from his son.

686
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,690
Release when we see money.

687
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,070
We get paid twice—

688
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,800
sound good?

689
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,590
Lao Jiu, Da Zong—

690
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,760
you're with Feng Si

691
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,110
on recon.

692
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,350
-OK.
-Aye.

693
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,820
Open approach or stealth?

694
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,570
Open!

695
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,630
I'm going home—
no need to wait for nightfall.

696
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,480
Halt!

697
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,260
Who goes there?

698
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,950
It's me,

699
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,440
Feng Si.

700
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,610
Well, well—look who it is!

701
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,310
Sanjin...

702
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Master Feng Si!

703
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,170
Where's fortune smiling on you these days?

704
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,550
Fortune? Ha!

705
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,570
Just peddling needles
and thread with my nephews—

706
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,000
barely keeps the pot boiling.

707
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What else can I do?

708
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,310
Best take your nephew home.

709
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,930
That boy of yours is so hungry
he's snatching chickens left and right.

710
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,790
Don't you fret.

711
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,010
Now that I'm back,
the wife and kids won't go hungry!

712
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,540
Alright.

713
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,640
Come, lads—with me!

714
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,200
Go on, then!

715
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,920
Follow me!

716
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,510
Sister-in-law, swing with me awhile!

717
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,030
Steward Liu said

718
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,790
this rope holds two—

719
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,290
come!

720
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,320
You're grown now—

721
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,880
must you still play and snack
like a child?

722
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,590
Wendian's been gone for days.

723
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,640
Won't you write

724
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,590
to urge him home?

725
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,680
Must we revisit this?

726
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,900
When you brought me back, you promised—

727
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,810
no pressure, no demands.

728
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,270
Now you backtrack?

729
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,860
Like I told you,

730
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,960
I swallowed my pride
and begged him already!

731
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,570
Useless—he won't listen.

732
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,200
If I vex you so,

733
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,770
why fetch me home at all?

734
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,270
What nonsense!

735
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,540
Where are you—?

736
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,790
Out. To breathe.

737
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,570
You!

738
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,510
Every talk, you flee.

739
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,960
When will you mature?

740
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,930
I only want what's best!

741
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,280
Best for me?

742
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,270
I'm sick of it!

743
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,080
Nagging the moment I return!

744
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,880
At least come back to eat!

745
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,200
I won't!

746
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,400
My child...

747
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,240
your mother's studying.

748
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
This book?

749
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,160
Your father found it for me.

750
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,830
I hope

751
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,460
you'll grow intelligent,

752
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
love reading too,

753
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,830
and become as capable

754
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,640
and steadfast

755
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,270
as your Father.

756
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,260
When will he come home,

757
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,750
I wonder...

758
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,480
To whom are you speaking?

759
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,590
Are you missing Dajiao,

760
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,830
the child's father?

761
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,710
What brings you here?

762
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,250
Is your father-in-law around?

763
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,440
Just back from the fields.

764
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,220
I'd rather not see him.

765
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,170
Still stewing over that egg?

766
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,800
But I missed you!

767
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,510
Look,

768
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,790
I brought treats—

769
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,110
peanuts, longan, and dates.

770
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,880
Xiuxiu, you can't just stay in bed

771
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,510
while pregnant.

772
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,310
Walk with me—get some fresh air!

773
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,090
Let's go.

774
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,840
Get some energy from the earth!

775
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:54,720
Feng Si,

776
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,460
you have

777
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,730
a wife and two sons—

778
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,030
a decent life.

779
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,470
Why become an outlaw?

780
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,200
If I had such a home,

781
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,470
I'd never leave.

782
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,570
Decent?

783
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,270
My land was swindled away by mister Ning.

784
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,870
Should I feast on air and dirt?

785
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,830
Aye, why grovel

786
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,720
when banditry's freer?

787
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,640
Look—

788
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
from my house,

789
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,000
head west to the entrance of the fortress.

790
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,550
Enter there,

791
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,270
then turn east and charge straight

792
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,330
to the opera stage.

793
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Ning's Residence

794
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,590
is the grand gate

795
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,750
beside it.

796
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,750
Come—

797
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,110
I'll show you!

798
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,570
Xiuxiu.

799
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,440
Look at you—pining for Dajiao

800
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,880
has worn your face thin!

801
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,480
Has it?

802
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,560
I do miss him terribly...

803
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,160
Why doesn't anyone
ever pine for me like that?

804
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,220
Didn't Fei Wendian return recently?

805
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,210
Sometimes he's attentive—

806
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,640
speaks softly,

807
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,440
reads to me,

808
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,480
his gaze so intense

809
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,160
it makes me blush.

810
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,880
But when the book closes,

811
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,790
his eyes

812
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,440
go empty again.

813
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,070
After learning I wasn't pregnant,

814
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,880
it was like a weight lifted off him.

815
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,020
I don't know what to make of it.

816
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,710
Silly Susu.

817
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,070
Feng Si's back?

818
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,719
You've got company—

819
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,670
don't recognize these faces.

820
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,400
My nephews.

821
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,250
Come inside for a chat?

822
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,250
No, no. I'm in a hurry to see my boys.

823
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,540
What's wrong, Xiuxiu?

824
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,159
-We're leaving.
-See you.

825
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,719
Alright.

826
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,190
What's wrong, Xiuxiu?

827
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,480
Susu,

828
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,670
you're faster—

829
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,590
run and find Kejin! The militia!

830
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,850
Why? What do I tell him?

831
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,070
Tell Kejin,

832
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,850
Feng Si's back with bandits in tow.

833
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,909
I'd recognize those bandits
even if they were ashes!

834
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,409
Bandits?

835
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,639
Got it! I'm going now!

836
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,280
Don't be scared, Xiuxiu!

837
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm going!

838
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,400
Run!

839
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,190
Still no word from Dajiao?

840
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,570
It's been 13 days since he left.

841
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,480
Father!

842
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,760
Father!

843
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,960
Father!

844
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,800
Father!

845
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,250
What's wrong?

846
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,770
Father,

847
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,360
do you have a nephew?

848
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,480
Nephew?

849
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,070
Our family's just me and Feng Si—

850
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,170
what nephew?

851
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,190
A cousin maybe?

852
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,710
Impossible.

853
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,320
Our branch has none. Why?

854
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,300
I just saw Uncle Si

855
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,810
leading bandits into the village—

856
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,600
the same ones who kidnapped me!

857
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,510
I overheard Uncle Si
refer to them as nephews.

858
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,510
that bandit is his nephew.

859
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,870
Feng Si's running with bandits?

860
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,460
That thousand-cuts scum!

861
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,030
I'll drag him back myself!

862
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,280
Father, we don't know their purpose yet.

863
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,430
I've sent Susu to the militia and Kejin.

864
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,750
Stay here—

865
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,960
wait for news.

866
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,670
Old Man,

867
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,870
wait inside!

868
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,890
Feng Si dug his own grave.

869
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,070
Don't meddle—sit!

870
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,260
At your age,

871
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,800
you can't reform him.

872
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:20,940
Hurry up!

873
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,490
Move it!

874
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,950
Go!

875
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,360
Xiuxiu!

876
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,360
Xiuxiu!

877
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,710
Susu!

878
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,320
Slow down—catch your breath!

879
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,400
How's it going?

880
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,510
Kejin's men have sealed
both entrances of the fortress.

881
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,800
They're currently raiding Feng Si's house,
spliting into two groups.

882
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,440
Kejin said

883
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
once the bandits are captured,
his men will interrogate them—

884
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
then everything will become clear.

885
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,510
Old Man!

886
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,190
Xiuxiu. Your father—look!

887
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,030
Old Man!

888
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,710
Susu!

889
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,550
It's dangerous—stay back!

890
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,090
Old Man.

891
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,510
Wait!

892
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,640
Xiuxiu, Kejin asked you not to show up.

893
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,360
What's going on?

894
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,460
Xiuxiu!

895
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,010
That little brat!

896
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,400
Consorting with bandits—

897
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,680
I'll teach him a lesson for Father!

898
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,390
Old Man!

899
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,760
This path leads to the mountains.

900
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,820
You can go this way.

901
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,100
Old Man!

902
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:33,780
Feng Si!

903
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,990
Feng Er...

904
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,030
Feng Si!

905
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,150
The spitfire lass
seems to have recognized me.

906
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,150
It's okay.

907
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,840
They're all my family.

908
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,210
Feng Si!

909
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,900
I'll handle them.

910
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,500
Come here.

911
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,840
Feng Er!

912
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,150
Let me explain!

913
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,320
These are my

914
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,400
business partners.

915
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,590
We swore brotherhood—

916
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,090
they call me uncle,
so they're your nephews too!

917
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,970
Come, greet your Second Uncle!

918
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,030
Come!

919
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:02,850
Second Uncle.

920
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,710
Scram! Both of you—disappear!

921
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,150
And you—go home,

922
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,640
cut ties,

923
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,410
or I'll break your damn legs!

924
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,000
Feng Er...

925
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,510
Feng Si!

926
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,070
Old Man!

927
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,480
Feng Si!

928
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,190
-Come back!
-Old Man.

929
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,880
What is it?

930
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,230
We're exposed!

931
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:23,910
Oh no!

932
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,530
Drop it!

933
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,610
We have to control this mess quickly!

934
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,040
Get over here! Now!

935
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,990
Mother!

936
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,920
They are bandits!

937
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,200
Drop it! Quiet!

938
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,430
Or all of you die!

939
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,440
I'll go find Kejin.

940
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,150
Susu!

941
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,080
-Kejin!
-No, no.

942
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,750
His... his place is nearby.

943
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,510
We'll hide there first.

944
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,920
Move!

945
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,740
If you want my Sister-in-law to live,
get home now.

946
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,250
What's going on here?

947
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:46,930
Move!

948
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,480
What are you doing now?

949
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,480
Hurry up!

950
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,270
What's this about?

951
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,730
-Let go!
-Where is Feng Si?

952
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,960
I've no idea.

953
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,150
He hasn't come back.

954
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,360
Lie!

955
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,980
Boss, there's no one inside.

956
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,630
May I please learn your name, Sir?

957
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,040
Please tell me.
I'll send Feng Si to find you.

958
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,770
Save it!

959
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Take them all away.

960
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,630
What are you doing?

961
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,850
Move! Move!

962
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,010
What's going on here?

963
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,610
Step back!

964
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,980
Father!

965
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,580
Step back!

966
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,630
Drop the hoe!

967
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,880
Xiuxiu!

968
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,280
Father!

969
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,810
Drop the hoe, and go inside!

970
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,730
Mother!

971
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,560
Let my mother go.

972
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,360
Xiuxiu, stay back!

973
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,760
You're carrying a child!

974
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,480
Feng Er, drop it.

975
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,300
A wise man doesn't fight
when the odds are against him—

976
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,090
drop it!

977
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,980
Move! This way!

978
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,630
Hurry!

979
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,380
Xiuxiu!

980
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,130
Quick! Pull Xiuxiu over there!

981
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,850
Everyone Back off!

982
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,100
Take one more step

983
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,140
and I'll cut her!

984
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,070
Drop it now!

985
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,710
Feng Si.

986
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,670
What the hell are you doing?

987
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,670
Get out of the way.

988
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,510
Let's sound the alarm.

989
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,440
Alarm?

990
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,940
Who knows if they'll even hear it?

991
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,980
We'll be dead by then!

992
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,650
Uncle Si,

993
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,120
weren't you going home

994
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,250
to see your kids?

995
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,630
Yes, to see the child.

996
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,720
Release my Mother. See kids and leave.

997
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,310
That's right.

998
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,910
I just wanted to see my children.

999
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,340
Commander Ning—

1000
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,710
grant me this mercy.

1001
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,020
Let me see them, and I'll go.

1002
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,800
Open the entrance of the fortress.

1003
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,110
Once I'm outside the fortress,

1004
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,770
I'll let my sister-in-law go.

1005
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,520
Quick, save your Auntie!

1006
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,820
I believe Xiuxiu.

1007
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Release Auntie.

1008
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,710
I'll escort you out of the entrance.

1009
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,430
Look, I'm disarming!

1010
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,080
I'm putting it on the ground.

1011
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,400
Everything's down now.

1012
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,630
Deal. Replace her for Ning Kejin.
That works.

1013
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,300
Deal. Ning Kejin is a good deal.

1014
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
Switch now.

1015
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,520
I'm raising up my hands too.

1016
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,380
Replacing Ning Kejin makes a good deal.

1017
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,570
Switch now.

1018
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,020
Let her go.

1019
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,270
Action!

1020
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,480
Stay still.

1021
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,710
Bind them all.

1022
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,480
Yes.

1023
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,070
Everyone!

1024
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,610
Tie up the horses properly,

1025
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,090
and keep quiet.

1026
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,630
Let's wait for the wooden clapper,

1027
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,960
then send in the signal.

1028
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,750
-Yes!
-Yes!

1029
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,600
Hurry up!

1030
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,920
Over there!

1031
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,560
Get down!

1032
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,490
Hide yourself.

1033
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,040
To the back. Go!

1034
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,130
Kneel down!

1035
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,350
Spit it out, Feng Si.

1036
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Why'd you bring these two bandits
back to the village?

1037
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,330
They...

1038
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,120
They are not bandits.

1039
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,070
They're my distant relatives.

1040
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,200
Distant relatives?

1041
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,030
What kind of distant relatives
wander outside with knives

1042
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,670
instead of staying at home?

1043
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,760
Well,

1044
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,720
since they're already here...

1045
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,320
I thought

1046
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,620
I should show them around.

1047
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,220
You can't even lie properly!

1048
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,590
Drag them out! Serve them with the stick!

1049
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,630
Let me go!

1050
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,570
Our Second Boss is currently waiting
in the mountains.

1051
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,140
He'll come and kill you all.

1052
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:16,590
Let's go,

1053
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,790
Kill everyone! Slaughter the village!

1054
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,000
You evil, Feng Si!

1055
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,030
How dare you lead bandits back
to massacre our village?

1056
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,050
Come with me!

1057
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,990
Move it! Get up!

1058
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,310
Come here!

1059
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,300
All of you.

1060
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,840
The bandits have surrounded the village!

1061
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,020
Quick, tell my Second Uncle—

1062
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,350
have him warn everyone:

1063
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,380
The bandits are coming to slaughter us!

1064
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,260
Hide all valuables

1065
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,150
in every house!

1066
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,910
Old folks, kids, and women, take cover!

1067
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,040
All able-bodied men over 15,

1068
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,360
gather below the fortress!

1069
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,770
And patrol the fortress wall!

1070
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,370
Am I clear?

1071
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:05,940
Yes!

1072
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:06,660
Go now!
