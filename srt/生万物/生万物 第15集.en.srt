00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,940
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,830
Sister-in-law,

4
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,200
I still want to talk to you.

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
I don't have time.

6
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,350
Sister-in-law, where are you going?

7
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,950
I'm going to the Goddess Temple,

8
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,000
to fulfill my vow,

9
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,090
thanking Her
for granting the Fei family an heir.

10
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,510
And to pray for blessings for you, Susu,

11
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,760
and the baby in Susu's belly. Happy now?

12
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,160
Sister-in-law, must you go now?

13
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,520
Fulfilling a vow
doesn't need to be this urgent.

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,540
But I promised to do it today—

15
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,360
it has to be today.

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,320
Sister-in-law!

17
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,400
I heard everything from inside!

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,730
You're going to the Goddess Temple, right?

19
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,170
I love going there!

20
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,100
During the New Year temple fair,
Xiuxiu just took me there!

21
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,360
You're still carrying a child!

22
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,930
That mountain road is so bumpy—

23
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,910
what if you get jostled around
in the carriage?

24
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,310
You'll worry me to death!

25
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,840
Be good and rest at home, alright?

26
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,400
I'll bring you back treats.

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,190
Sister-in-law...

28
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,590
You—

29
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,700
stay home and take good care of Susu.

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,230
Let's go.

31
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,280
Susu,

32
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,960
you rest well inside, alright?

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,220
I'm going out for a bit.

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,590
Why won't they take me
to the Temple of the Goddess?

35
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,390
So unfair!

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,250
Everyone's out enjoying
this lovely weather...

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,850
Might as well suffocate me in here!

38
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,500
Let out the string!

39
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,590
Hurry up, hurry up!

40
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,400
It's flying!

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,430
Wait for me!

42
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,770
Stop grabbing it!

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
Wait—!

44
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,079
Spring's really in the air—

45
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,910
even the kids are flying kites now.

46
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,079
If I had a son,

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,300
I'd make him a soaring eagle kite!

48
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,360
Enough daydreaming.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,590
Back to work.

50
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,230
Zhuzi, Zhuzi's wife,

51
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,829
busy with work, I see.

52
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,030
I'd like to have a word with you.

53
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,360
Huh?

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Chat with us?

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,320
Yeah, just a little chat.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
But we're working—

57
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,990
you'll end up with mud all over your feet!

58
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,090
It doesn't matter.

59
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,110
I just… wanted to talk with you.

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,960
About something you'd care to hear.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,800
What topic would we care about?

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,840
Besides farming and filling our bellies,

63
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,900
what else is there?

64
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,150
he Farmers' Association—

65
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,150
what do you think about it?

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,320
And...

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,120
what about
the Northern Expedition Army's march?

68
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,740
They helped us
establish associations along the way,

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,120
fight for lower rents
and reduced interest rates,

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,940
and promote permanent tenancy rights.
Any thoughts on this?

71
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,650
Mr. Fei,

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,650
Sure, I've heard things

73
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,630
about those Farmers' Associations.

74
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,430
But look at us—

75
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,100
we're just renting a few poor acres

76
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,940
from Li Junyi.

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,320
After rent's paid,
we barely keep ourselves fed.

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,120
On top of that,

79
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,870
there's also Zhang Zongchang?

80
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,110
Tax after tax—

81
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,640
they've skinned us near to death.

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,980
What you're talking about...

83
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,760
doesn't mean much
to folks like us.

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,460
We only believe
what these eyes can see.

85
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,340
What we can't see? We don't trust.

86
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,890
Move it!

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
Zhuzi, that's where you're wrong!

88
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,760
Just because something's unseen,

89
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,650
doesn't mean it can't succeed.

90
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,740
Supporting the Farmers' Association
means fighting for our own welfare—

91
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,770
this is earth-shaking change

92
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,530
for all us farmers!

93
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,830
With reduced rents and interest cuts,

94
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,240
with permanent tenancy rights,

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,600
we'll have better lives.

96
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,040
This is where we find real hope
for the future. Don't you agree?

97
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
Mr. Fei.

98
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,190
All this talk of yours,

99
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,120
supposedly for the benefit

100
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,160
of us farmers—

101
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,030
Exactly.

102
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,910
Then I really don't get it.

103
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,790
You are a young master

104
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,350
from a landlord family.

105
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,270
That lower rents, lower interest,

106
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,270
even permanent tenancy…

107
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,720
wouldn't all that hurt you?

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,360
Now, if someone else said it,

109
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,040
maybe I'd listen.

110
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,640
But coming from you?
Just feels… off.

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,350
I'm not even your family's tenant,

112
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,350
but shouldn't you at least

113
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,230
ask your sister-in-law first?

114
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,080
If she and the other landlords

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,909
actually agreed to cut rents and taxes
for farmers—
So just… drop it.

116
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,880
even permanent land rights—

117
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,030
we'd be overjpyed!

118
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,909
You don't have to
go door-to-door preaching.

119
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,150
Let's... drop it here for now.

120
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,270
Alright, let's go.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,140
Come on.

122
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,710
Yes,

123
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,850
you're absolutely right.

124
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,240
I will keep persuading my sister-in-law.

125
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,000
But, Zhuzi's wife—

126
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,350
even if our status and place
are different,

127
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,710
please believe me:

128
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,640
my heart beats with yours.

129
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,550
I want to use what little power I have

130
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,790
to unite all of us farmers—

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,210
to stand together
and demand our rights from the landlords!

132
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,790
Alright, alright.

133
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,590
I believe you.

134
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,650
Now go on—keep persuading.

135
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,470
Go!

136
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,430
This is indeed a stubborn ox.

137
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,580
Here, all wrapped up for you.

138
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,880
You're consuming this salt slow—

139
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,350
better hurry before it clumps.

140
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,010
Come back when it's finished.

141
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,330
Humpback Guo!

142
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,470
What'd you throw at me?

143
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,470
Was that a dart?

144
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,390
I'm here for treats!

145
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,990
Get all your goodies out now!

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,520
You look rushed.

147
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,520
Tell me then, what do you want?

148
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,159
My stock's running low...

149
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,370
That foreign candy

150
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,620
that blackens teeth?

151
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,230
The...cho...chocolate?

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,140
Chocolate, dried persimmons,

153
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,110
steamed dates, and sesame candy...

154
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,010
Is this because of pregnancy cravings?

155
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,909
Most people just
crave sour or spicy foods,

156
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,110
but your cravings...

157
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,230
quite a mixed bag!

158
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,510
I'm not in the mood for your jokes.

159
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,780
Who dared upset our precious miss?

160
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,650
My sister-in-law!

161
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,550
She went to the Goddess Temple without me.

162
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,870
Locked me home alone on such a fine day!

163
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,800
I'll do whatever I please now!

164
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,420
See how well I know you?

165
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,520
I knew you were upset
the moment I saw you.

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,780
Good attitude though.

167
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,000
If others treat us poorly,

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
no reason we should too, eh?

169
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,910
Wait here—let me get you some treats.

170
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,030
Take your pick!

171
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,830
But about that foreign candy...

172
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,780
We're fresh out of chocolate.

173
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,350
That shipment's always gone in a flash.

174
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,080
No foreign candy?

175
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,150
Then why waste my time with all that talk?

176
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,909
Now, young Miss, don't be angry—

177
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,560
Look!

178
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,890
These nut kernels are just as fine,

179
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,990
see?

180
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,730
And there's more—
a whole second layer underneath!

181
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,909
Nothing new here—
we have all this at home.

182
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,230
What nonsense! How's this not new?

183
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,830
Not a single tough bit in the batch—

184
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,030
crispy as winter ice!

185
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,230
Wrap it all up.

186
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,320
Like all of it?

187
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,120
Every last bit.
Put it on my account—

188
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,050
just bill my sister-in-law later.

189
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,110
Wouldn't mind you
throwing more tantrums...

190
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
What was that?

191
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,830
"I said...

192
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,080
your frown wounds my poor heart!

193
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,010
Go home and wait for notice.

194
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,870
We'll meet at Tietou's place later,

195
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,650
for the oath-taking.

196
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,270
What's this Farmers' Association anyway?
And what's permanent tenancy?

197
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,870
That's a very good question.

198
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
This Farmers' Association?
It's our salvation!

199
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,790
It's here to help folks like us—

200
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,000
to stand with us farmers
and fight for our rights!

201
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,860
We'll band together

202
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,110
and demand permanent tenancy
from those landlords!

203
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,640
What's permanent tenancy?

204
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,730
Permanent tenancy means that

205
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,880
we get to farm it forever.

206
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,710
They can't just take it back
whenever they please,

207
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,710
or hand it out to
whoever they like!

208
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,790
Now tell me—
is that good or what?

209
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,560
Great!

210
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,350
What's drawn on this sign?

211
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,820
A...mud eel?

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Oh, that's no mud eel—

213
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,920
it's the emblem
of our Farmers' Association!

214
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,200
What you're seeing is our plow—
the very tool that tills our soil!

215
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,930
Of course...

216
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,920
the carving on this sign

217
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,250
might not be the finest craftsmanship...

218
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,050
Tietou.

219
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,550
I planned to

220
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,230
finish mobilizing the masses

221
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,400
before approaching you.

222
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,510
Because I knew—

223
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
with your influence,

224
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,180
you could rally everyone

225
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,320
and get this Farmers' Association started
in no time.

226
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,630
But I never expected

227
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,440
you've already begun the work!

228
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,680
Here—take this.

229
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,420
These are my field notes

230
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,500
from days of investigations.

231
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,170
I've already explained

232
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,930
the Association's purpose
to every farmer I met.

233
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
When you need help—

234
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,470
any help at all—
come find me.

235
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,350
Whether practical groundwork
or theoretical guidance,

236
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,870
I've got some experience to share.

237
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,030
Go on, take them.

238
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,200
Eyes off!

239
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,960
Mr. Fei.

240
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,750
What's this all about? I don't quite...

241
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,750
I want to help you.

242
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,200
You—help me?

243
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,090
Oh, sure, sure.

244
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,200
This Farmers' Association—

245
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
it's the association for us farmers.

246
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
What's it to you?

247
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,470
How could you help us?

248
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,600
Look at what you are.

249
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,280
A landlord's young master.

250
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,070
A privileged son.

251
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,920
How can the Farmers' Association
tolerate a landload?

252
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,680
Answer me that!

253
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
-Exactly.
-That's true.

254
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,010
So don't you go meddling in this!

255
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,080
Alright, listen up everyone!

256
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,040
You few there—

257
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
listen up now:

258
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,320
Join the meeting at my place,

259
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
and don't any of you forget it!

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,380
These are our own matters,

261
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,510
so keep that in mind.

262
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,800
Alright, break it up now, disperse!

263
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,230
Go about your business for now,
and wait for further notice!

264
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,360
Wait for the notice!

265
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,470
Okay.

266
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,750
Feng Tietou.

267
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,350
By order of Comrade Bai:

268
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,510
You are to attend the struggle session

269
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,800
against the despotic landlord Pan Xiaogui
in Xiazhuang Village this afternoon.

270
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,110
Bring your activist group

271
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,800
to observe and learn from the proceedings.

272
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
A full debriefing meeting

273
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
will be convened upon his return.

274
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,080
Great news!

275
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,380
That's great news!

276
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,060
Let's go now.

277
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,230
Dajiao.

278
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,230
Dajiao,

279
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,530
come on, keep up.

280
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,750
Mother.

281
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,040
I'm back from delivering Father's meal.

282
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,530
He said he won't need
single-horned this afternoon.

283
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,130
Come here.

284
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,890
Where's Dajiao?

285
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,590
He sent word

286
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,540
that he's attending the struggle session
against Pan Xiaogui in Xiazhuang Village.

287
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,600
He said not to worry

288
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,920
and promised to return before nightfall.

289
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,280
Pass it to me.

290
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,830
Mother,

291
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,990
I need to go out again.

292
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Susu—

293
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,680
Susu.

294
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,410
Sister-in-law.

295
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,340
Come here. Look!

296
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,200
See? I didn't lie to you, did I?

297
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,040
I bought you these sweets you wanted,
and hawthorn candies!

298
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

299
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,080
Where's Wendian?

300
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,830
He went out.

301
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,640
Sister-in-law.

302
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,540
Where have you been?

303
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
We agreed you'd look after Susu!

304
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,050
Don't you know what elders say?

305
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,660
When the baby hears

306
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,320
its father's voice often,

307
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,120
that little head grows sharper!

308
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,710
Sister-in-law, I'm going back to my room.

309
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,510
Get rest.

310
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,950
Sister-in-law,
I have something important to tell you.

311
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,540
I saw it, Sister-in-law.

312
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,770
The Farmers' Association
in our valiage is established,

313
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,590
with Tietou leading it.

314
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,320
And today,

315
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,590
Xiazhuang is holding a struggle session
against Pan Xiaogui.

316
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,040
Tietou's taking the lead?

317
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,830
Perfect.

318
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,470
I just got his land back

319
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,680
from Feng Er—

320
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,310
let him farm it another year.

321
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,790
He ought to be thanking me,

322
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,040
not causing trouble!

323
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,080
And...

324
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,200
that Pan Xiaogui?
Everybody knows what he is—

325
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,460
a straight-up tyrant!

326
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,920
To take revenge,

327
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,960
he dug up a tenant's ancestors' graves

328
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,230
and buried a donkey in their place.

329
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,290
Also, he set dogs on anyone
who stepped near his fields!

330
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,280
A struggle session against him?

331
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,630
That's mercy.

332
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,280
Truth is—

333
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,410
a monster like that belongs in chains.

334
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,350
Yes! You're absolutely right,
sister-in-law!

335
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,990
And let's add another charge

336
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,740
to Pan Xiaogui's crimes—

337
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,230
refusing to lower rents
and interest rates,

338
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,830
denying permanent tenancy!

339
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,250
That deserves double punishment!

340
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,520
Then what are you waiting for,
sister-in-law?

341
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,370
Round up the tenants—now!

342
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,630
Ask them straight:
Lower rents and interest…

343
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,890
or permanent tenancy?

344
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,120
Why should I do that?

345
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,400
Wait,

346
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,560
Wendian.

347
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,160
why are you doing this?W

348
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,710
Why keep pushing me to lead this?

349
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,570
Just because you've dabbled
in new learning,

350
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,550
now you're itching to overturn the world?

351
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,960
Should I go home and tell Father?

352
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,560
You think it's that easy?

353
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
If I'd known

354
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,510
your new learning

355
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,750
would target

356
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
your own sister-in-law,

357
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,400
I would never have let you study it!

358
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,530
That was satisfying—
watching Pan Xiaogui get what he deserved!

359
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,250
What's so funny?

360
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,830
Now you finally see
how we'll get things done back home, eh?

361
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,760
What do you mean?

362
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,080
How? Exactly like this—

363
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,810
starting with that old widow
of the Fei-Zuo clan!

364
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,860
This Pan Xiaogui—wicked to the bone!

365
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,690
Even grave-robbing wasn't beneath him,

366
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,920
tormenting those
tenant farmers mercilessly.

367
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,440
But Mrs. Fei...
surely she'd never stoop that low?

368
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,860
The speaker just revealed
how Pan Xiaogui swindled villagers

369
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,170
out of their homes.

370
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,320
While the homeless froze outside—

371
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,560
children dying of cold—

372
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,690
he feasted inside on the finest foods.

373
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,230
Exactly! He even helped Zhang Zongchang
garrison troops—

374
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,160
that scheme of collecting
four years' military grain tax in advance

375
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,490
was his brainchild too.

376
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
What a scourge!

377
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,710
Niu Wu is right,

378
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
but Mrs. Fei... she's no oppressor.

379
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,680
And you—

380
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,160
Didn't even askif she recognizes
the Farmers' Association,

381
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,390
if she accepts rent reduction,
interest cuts,

382
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,800
and permanent tenancy rights—

383
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,350
yet you're already set on punishing her?

384
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,560
Bullshit!

385
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,770
After all these years of my father and me
breaking our backs on that land—

386
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,110
she just took it back like that?

387
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,040
Starving me and my mother out?

388
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,530
I begged her so much,

389
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,040
but she wouldn't even
give us one more year.

390
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,960
How is she any better than Pan Xiaogui?

391
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,290
Isn't that an evil deed?

392
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,210
Enough.

393
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,900
All this useless hesitation!

394
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,360
If you keep second-guessing,

395
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,080
you'll never get anything done—
you'll never lead!

396
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,830
When we act, we act now.

397
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,890
Tonight, we will do it!

398
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,160
This is the Farmers' Association's
first big move—

399
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,830
we've gotta make it loud!

400
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,050
No half-assed, lukewarm crap.

401
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,810
If we're doing this,

402
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,380
we're bringing every farmhand
in this village.

403
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,800
All of them!
We fight for permanent tenancy—

404
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,960
so every man can eat his fill

405
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,020
and live decently!

406
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,000
Alright,

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,210
you four—

408
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,890
split into squads.

409
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,350
After dinner, let me know

410
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,090
how many men you've gathered.

411
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,710
Once we are done with this Mrs. Fei,

412
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,320
we'll take down the rest, one by one.

413
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,960
Tonight?

414
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,280
Why?

415
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,200
We have enough time—

416
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,460
it's barely past noon!

417
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,260
Once you report your numbers,

418
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,080
gather at my place.

419
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
Then we'll move out together.

420
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,350
Understand?

421
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,080
-Yes.
-We understand.

422
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,610
Brother!

423
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
What brother?

424
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,060
Who's your brother here?

425
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,490
In the Farmers' Association,
they use the title, Director.

426
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,750
From now on,
you call me Director, as well.

427
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,160
Okay, Director.

428
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,470
Yes, Director.

429
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,110
Director Tietou.

430
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,710
Director!

431
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,910
you need to call me Director too.

432
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,560
Try me, and I'll kick you.

433
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,080
All power to the Farmers' Association!

434
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,630
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

435
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,590
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

436
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,500
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

437
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,370
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

438
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,270
All power to the Farmers' Association!

439
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,070
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

440
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,870
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

441
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,970
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

442
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,100
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

443
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,800
All power to the Farmers' Association!

444
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,330
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

445
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,830
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

446
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,350
Lower rents! Higher Wage!
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

447
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,350
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

448
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,830
Today, we settle accounts
with Pan Xiaogui!

449
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,810
Once and for all!

450
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,510
Once and for all!

451
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,460
All power to the Farmers' Association!

452
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,070
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

453
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,800
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

454
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,920
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

455
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,830
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

456
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,590
Xiuxiu!

457
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,470
Lower rents! Interest Cut!

458
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,190
Xiuxiu!

459
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,609
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

460
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,200
Father!

461
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,710
Xiuxiu!

462
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,119
Father!

463
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,470
Let the people judge you!

464
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,960
Xiuxiu!

465
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,359
Let the people judge you!

466
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,200
Let the people judge you!

467
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,990
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

468
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,290
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

469
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:17,900
Father!

470
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,270
Let the people judge you!

471
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,030
Let the people judge you!

472
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,869
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

473
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,000
No more empty bellies—every man eats!

474
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,090
Sister-in-law.

475
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,770
Don't even step inside

476
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,120
if you're here to talk about
the Farmers' Association.

477
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,400
Just go back to school—

478
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,270
leave soon.

479
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,810
Sister-in-law,

480
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,720
you don't need to drive me away—

481
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,070
I won't force you to do anything.

482
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,030
But I know

483
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,640
what I must do now.

484
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,360
I'll stay...

485
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,230
and wait here with you.

486
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,140
What are we waiting for?

487
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,640
When the Farmers' Association
comes for you,

488
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,840
I'll go in your place!

489
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,000
You're the one

490
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,350
who raised me since I was little.

491
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,920
After all these years,
depending on each other,

492
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,050
I can't abandon you,

493
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,810
in such a situation.

494
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,360
Madam,

495
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,080
I need to speak with you.

496
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:35,920
Yep.

497
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,920
I heard Pan Xiaogui was denounced
by the Farmers' Association.

498
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,120
Now, Pan did some wicked things,

499
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,150
but you're nothing like him.

500
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,990
Thing is...

501
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,710
Spit it out!
Quit dancing around the point.

502
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,250
You might not know this yet.

503
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,490
Tietou and his lot

504
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,470
have riled up many tenants.

505
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,030
They're saying

506
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,790
if you don't agree
to lower rents, cut interest,

507
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,400
and grant permanent tenancy—

508
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,990
well, it won't matter
if you're a good landlord or not.

509
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,390
They'll make an example of you
all the same.

510
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,270
Who told you this?

511
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,090
Or were you sent to say it to me?

512
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
No, no.

513
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm just worried for you
and the young master—

514
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,400
for our whole Fei family.

515
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,400
Surely you understand—

516
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,200
those farmhands won't lift a finger
unless there's profit in it.

517
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,330
When they smell gain,
they pounce like starving wolves.

518
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,390
Think carefully about this.

519
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,270
You may go now.

520
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,380
Tietou's first target

521
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,920
is Mrs. Fei—that's plain as day.

522
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,160
This is about revenge!

523
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,280
He's never forgiven her
for taking back the land.

524
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,920
Now he's rallying

525
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,200
every farmhand in the village,

526
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,700
especially tenants of the Fei family,

527
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,580
demanding permanent tenancy,
rent reduction, and interest cut.

528
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,160
If this mob gets out of hand...

529
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,960
it'll be another

530
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,650
Pan Xiaogui struggle session,

531
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,820
and Mrs. Fei won't stand a chance!

532
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,490
Then what do we do?

533
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,440
Should I go warn the Fei family?

534
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,510
If Tietou sees you,
he'll hold grudge against you.

535
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,640
Mrs. Fei isn't a bad person,

536
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,650
I truly think we ought to help her.

537
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,930
I went to Xiazhuang Village
this afternoon.

538
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,260
You were there too?

539
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,990
Then... you saw it all?

540
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
By the time I got there,
the crowd had scattered—

541
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,280
but I know what went down.

542
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,730
Here's what I'm thinking:

543
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,120
we split up.

544
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,980
You go talk some sense into Tietou first.

545
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,110
That's impossible.

546
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,730
No use talking!
He won't listen to reason now!

547
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,630
If you try to persuade him like this...

548
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,310
-Over! Over! Over!
-Under! Under!

549
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,310
-Dajiao.
-Where's Kejin?

550
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,310
He's at the table.

551
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,010
Come on! Fill Boss's cup.

552
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,270
Boss!

553
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,510
Boss!

554
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,150
Kejin.

555
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,430
Dajiao, what a rare guest!

556
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,200
Come, sit down—
keep me company for a drink!

557
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm not drinking.

558
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,790
Would you please move your step here?

559
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,390
What's up?

560
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,360
Come here please.
I need to tell you something.

561
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,200
Now that you're here,

562
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,460
we'll talk right here!

563
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,930
The rest of you, scram.

564
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,840
Let's go in—go in and play!

565
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,750
-Go in.
-Come on.

566
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,280
Dajiao, have some peanuts.

567
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,140
Have some peanuts here.

568
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,250
You're such a rare gest.

569
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,270
What brings you here?

570
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,120
Kejin, you know about
the Farmers' Association, don't you?

571
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,430
I've heard some things...

572
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,050
What's going on?

573
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,250
Does Ning Xuexiang know about this too?

574
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,710
Xiuxiu didn't teach you any manners!

575
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,710
Ning Xuexiang?

576
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,550
Would it kill you to call him Father?

577
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,550
Now's not the right time for this!

578
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,910
Xiuxiu hasn't said anything,

579
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,110
but I know

580
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,710
she's sick with worry!

581
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,600
What's she worried about?

582
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,730
Xiuxiu's terrified

583
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,160
that the Farmers' Association

584
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,920
will target Father next—

585
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,660
forcing him to

586
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,030
reduce rents, cut interest,
and grant permanent tenancy.

587
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,120
She has no idea
if Father will agree on that.

588
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,520
Kejin,

589
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,790
at a time like this,

590
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,710
you must convince him not to resist.

591
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,680
Don't let him cling to those things!

592
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
This afternoon in Xiazhuang...

593
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,820
you know the Landlord Pan?

594
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,160
Pan Xiaogui, right?

595
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,310
He's richer than our father,

596
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,600
with more land.

597
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,650
What happened?

598
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,990
He refused
the Farmers' Association demands.

599
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,320
So they dragged him out.

600
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,620
Tenants lined up

601
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,030
to expose his crimes—

602
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,030
rotting vegetables, eggs

603
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,450
to the face.

604
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,550
He broke fast.

605
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,580
At last he agreed to everything.

606
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,750
He agreed to reduce rents,
cut interest rates,

607
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,210
and grant permanent tenancy
to the farmers.

608
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,550
Our village

609
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,950
won't see trouble.

610
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,560
No Pan Xiaogui here,

611
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,090
no Farmers' Association either.

612
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,680
Who'd dare make waves?

613
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,820
Everyone knows the stakes!

614
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,820
This whole thing?

615
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,900
Like picking coins
straight from a landlord's pocket!

616
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,860
Isn't it so?

617
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,060
Go tell Xiuxiu:

618
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,030
Rest easy.

619
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,070
I'm here—

620
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,670
Father won't lose a hair.

621
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,470
Kejin,

622
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,400
you really think

623
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,030
no one dares to try this?

624
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,360
Don't tell me you're behind this, Dajiao!

625
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,090
Pretend I never spoke!

626
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,990
Kejin, for Xiuxiu's sake—

627
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,050
talk some sense into Father. I'm out.

628
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,790
Go tell my sister—

629
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
I got the message.

630
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,710
Tietou!

631
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,470
Tietou!

632
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,790
I've got something important to tell you.

633
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,050
What is it? Spit it out.

634
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,360
This concerns your big plans.

635
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,090
Are you gonna hear me properly?

636
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,210
Fine. Talk.

637
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,230
I've been thinking about your big plan.

638
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,180
You can't just target
the Fei family first!

639
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,230
Why not?

640
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
You need to gain trust first.

641
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,710
Gain trust?

642
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,390
What exactly do you mean?

643
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,910
To achieve great things,

644
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,960
you must make

645
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,160
your followers

646
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,550
obey you willingly,

647
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,120
follow you wholeheartedly.

648
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,180
This is how you truly command
the people's allegiance.

649
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,460
Fair point.

650
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,680
Sure, my four childhood buddies and you—

651
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,560
you're all willing to follow me, right?

652
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,600
Fine.

653
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,270
But here's the problem:

654
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,990
If we target the Fei Family first,

655
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,160
everyone will say

656
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,510
Tietou's exploiting his position
for personal revenge.

657
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,160
They'll claim you're using
the Farmers' Association for own agenda.

658
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,880
Wait, what?

659
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,880
Think carefully:

660
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,880
If Mrs. Fei caves—

661
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
agreeing to rent reductions,
interest cuts,

662
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,030
and permanent tenancy—what then?

663
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,690
Once people connect the dots,

664
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,120
they'll realize you manipulated
the Farmers' Association

665
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,790
for vengeance.

666
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,840
And when word gets out?

667
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,920
Will your men still trust you?

668
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,070
Will they follow you willingly?

669
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,880
More importantly, if that spreads out,

670
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,990
will Mr. Bai—

671
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,120
who appointed you
as head of the Farmers' Association—

672
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,710
and the other officials

673
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,510
still have faith in you?

674
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,570
You're right.

675
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,610
That makes sense.

676
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,030
Look, I won't lie—

677
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,030
all I want is to crush that old widow.

678
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,880
But if you're saying

679
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,270
I need the people's trust first...

680
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,750
then I can't touch her yet.

681
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,650
Alright.

682
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,290
Let me think on this.

683
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,030
My advice?

684
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,260
Gather all the village landlords

685
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,710
for a meeting.

686
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,830
First, ask who's willing to

687
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,180
voluntarily reduce rent, cut interest,

688
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,510
and grant permanent tenancy—

689
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,510
start with diplomacy before force.

690
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,640
And Xiuxiu has got a big surprise

691
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
for your Farmers' Association!

692
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,610
What's that?

693
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,230
She swore me to secrecy…

694
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,690
you'll find out tomorrow.

695
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,230
Cut the suspense—what's this big surprise

696
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,790
that has to wait till dawn?

697
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,020
Wait overnight then.

698
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,130
Let the anticipation kill you.

699
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,120
Okay.

700
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,450
Fine!

701
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,330
To win the crowd,

702
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,980
I'll spare the old widow—for now.

703
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,580
But your father-in-law, Ning Xuexiang?
He's first on the block!

704
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,400
Xiuxiu!

705
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,120
Go! Move it!

706
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,680
-Xiuxiu.
-Father.

707
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,360
Go! hurry up.

708
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,030
Xiu—Xiuxiu.

709
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,070
Move it! Accept your punishment! Hurry up.

710
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,640
Father.

711
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,960
Xiu.

712
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,160
Sister-in-law.

713
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
it's late—

714
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,420
where are you heading?

715
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,810
Sister-in-law,

716
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,600
what's that in your hand?

717
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,450
I'm on my way to deliver a message
to Ning Xuexiang.

718
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,680
See?

719
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,890
Did you see that?

720
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,200
This... this is their landlord's familuy!

721
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,880
Look at your wife!

722
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,780
No yelling!

723
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,740
Go to him now?
What are you talking about?

724
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,490
Don't you already know what I'm gonna say?

725
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,360
What?

726
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,550
Dajiao!

727
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,250
You knew about this too—

728
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,000
knew what the letter said.

729
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,760
After all my trust in you!

730
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,680
I barely finished telling you at home,

731
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,780
and by the time you came back from supper,

732
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,070
you'd already blabbed to your wife?

733
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,710
You—unbelievable!

734
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,270
Have you forgotten who you are?

735
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,550
You're a farmhand!

736
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,160
Not one of their damn landlords!

737
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,640
Tietou—

738
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
if you really wanna know,

739
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
see for yourself.

740
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,030
-I can't read.
-Brother.

741
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,030
What brother?

742
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,290
It's Director Tietou.

743
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
-What?
-Director.

744
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,230
Let me

745
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,200
report our assembled numbers

746
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,070
to you.

747
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,840
Your business can wait.

748
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,430
Read this letter to me—now.

749
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:34,990
Quickly!

750
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,170
Baisui.

751
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,470
As if I can read.

752
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,490
You read it!

753
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,120
You must've heard by now.

754
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,890
Kn—Know what?

755
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,320
I can't read the next word.
That's all I recognize.

756
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,530
None of you can read!

757
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,290
I, I can read...

758
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,840
I can even write my own name!

759
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,120
I'll read it for you.

760
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,330
You read it.

761
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,770
Quickly! Read it!

762
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
What I wrote is:

763
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,960
You must know about
the Farmers' Association by now.

764
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,020
You must have known

765
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,990
that this Farmers' Association helps

766
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,680
farmhands demand

767
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,990
permanent tenancy,

768
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,920
rent cuts, and lower interest.

769
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,810
I won't lecture you;

770
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,930
you understand the stakes.

771
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,840
The time has come for landlords to act.

772
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,150
When you refused to sell land to free me,

773
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,670
you only broke my heart.

774
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,180
But if you resist

775
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
the Farmers' Association's terms now,

776
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,210
you'll become the enemy

777
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,790
of every tenant, every laborer—

778
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,550
tenant farmers.

779
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,530
just like Pan Xiaogui.

780
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,760
That's a role

781
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,700
I beg you not to play.

782
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,850
It's finished.

783
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,070
No lies?

784
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,250
If you don't believe me,

785
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,410
find someone who can read
and have them repeat it to you.

786
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,010
I'm going to Fourth Grandpa.

787
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,200
I dare you to lie to me.

788
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,230
Even if you didn't deliver
the letter to Ning Xuexiang,

789
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,640
your advice means nothing.

790
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,100
We don't need your advice.

791
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,680
The Farmers' Association's business

792
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
is ours to decide—

793
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,420
no outsiders get a say.

794
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,330
Fine! Someone—

795
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,960
keep watch.

796
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,600
Don't let her leave this house.

797
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,160
Tietou,

798
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,680
you're crossing a line.

799
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,550
Don't flaunt petty authority
like it's imperial decree!

800
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,750
Why guard her?

801
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,310
After all your sister-in-law did—

802
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,310
even embroidering banners for you?

803
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,440
Ungrateful wretch.

804
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,320
Flag? What flag?

805
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,760
I want to embroider a flag
for your Farmers' Association.

806
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,360
I know

807
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,200
you started this Farmers' Association

808
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,070
to speak up for the farmhands,

809
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,200
to stand by them,

810
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,160
to give them a better life.

811
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,510
I admire you for that,

812
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,140
and I've been thinking…

813
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,510
how can I help?

814
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,120
So I'd like to stitch a flag
for your Farmers' Association—

815
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,720
something you can raise high

816
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,500
when you rally

817
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,530
for the farmhands,

818
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,480
when you stand up for their rights.

819
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,160
Great!

820
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,560
Very good!

821
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,370
You can keep embroidering your flag,

822
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,790
but my work won't stop.

823
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,710
Especially now—

824
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,200
this is when we can't afford
a single misstep.

825
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,730
Alright,

826
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,920
Then I'll trouble you

827
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,440
to go inside and embroider the banner.

828
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,270
You'd better go keep watch.

829
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,740
Until we've fully assembled,

830
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,780
don't let her out.

831
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,660
Roger that!

832
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,070
Who gave you the right
to watch my daughter-in-law?

833
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,150
One night without oversight,

834
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,870
and you thinks you're the law?

835
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,120
If he dares to

836
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,030
lay a finger on Xiuxiu—

837
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,790
I'll break his legs myself!

838
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,400
Save it.

839
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,890
What do you two old folks know?

840
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,600
Get inside. Keep watch for me.

841
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:45,960
To my place. Come on—let's talk business.

842
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,760
Dajiao. You don't get involved.

843
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,290
You just wait!

844
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,030
Easy.

845
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,660
Father,

846
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,590
I still need to get involved.

847
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,340
I'll explain to you later.

848
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Director Tietou,

849
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,360
our squad's assembled—

850
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,660
near Wu San's place in Xiawa.

851
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,110
We have 13 men in total.

852
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,840
My squad's not ready;

853
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,590
a few backed out last minute.

854
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,790
There are only 7 now.

855
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,020
What happened?

856
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,780
Some say they're tired from a day's work—

857
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,870
some haven't even eaten yet,

858
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,510
others finished dinnerr
and turned in early

859
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,970
to save strength for tomorrow's fieldwork.

860
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,290
And those hired hands?

861
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,410
They wouldn't dare be late at all.

862
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,030
After all I've done for them,

863
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,510
all they care about

864
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,840
is eating and sleeping?

865
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
If we succeed,

866
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,970
their lives will improve—

867
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,470
can't they grasp that?

868
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,840
Still acting like hired hands?

869
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,170
Go! Round them up again!

870
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,010
There were 60 to 70
took our tokens this morning—

871
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,750
anyone who took one
is a Farmers' Association member now!

872
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,750
They have to join!

873
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,880
Make it clear:

874
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,360
I, Feng Tietou, am here

875
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,510
to back them!

876
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,270
Every grievance, every humiliation
from the landlords,

877
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,510
we'll make it right—

878
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,740
if they stand with us!

879
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,400
Act like a real captain!

880
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,680
Alright, I'll give it another try.

881
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,690
Zhiquan. How many people do you have?

882
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,530
I have the same as Baisui's group.

883
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,920
I have only 8 people.

884
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,410
I only have 4 here.

885
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,290
I only handed out 6 tokens all morning.

886
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,030
How many people do you have again?

887
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,830
I have 13 here.

888
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,890
What can a handful of people
even accomplish?

889
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,640
Look at how we took down Pan Xiaogui—
that crowd, that energy!

890
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,640
That made an impact! That got heard!

891
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,680
Hold on, Director,

892
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,000
aren't we going to the Fei Residence?

893
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,550
Only her,

894
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,510
the Ning family's second daughter,

895
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,770
and Fei Wendian there—

896
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,570
we're just giving them a scare!

897
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,970
We're more than enough.

898
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,360
No.

899
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,510
Forget the old widow—

900
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,980
we're going after Ning Xuexiang!

901
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,040
Going after whom?

902
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,550
Ning Xuexiang.

903
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,120
Do you all think

904
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,640
I became head of the Farmers' Association

905
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,700
just for myself?

906
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,030
That none of you truly respect me?

907
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,840
No!

908
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,740
No?

909
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,850
We're taking down Ning Xuexiang.

910
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,710
Now, none of you disrespect me, do you?

911
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,270
We won't.

912
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,030
At first light,

913
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,830
we march—no matter how many show up.

914
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,350
Baisui,

915
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,110
take a few men

916
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,639
and block the village gate.

917
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,510
No one warns Ning Kejin.

918
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:18,880
Okay.

919
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,960
Once we've dealt with
the richest landlord in this village,

920
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,070
the rest will fall like dominos.

921
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,800
I'll join you

922
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,239
to gather people.

923
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,400
I refuse to believe this is how it ends!
Move, move!

924
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,989
What's the rush?

925
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,719
Xiuxiu can't finish embroidering

926
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,389
that banner overnight.

927
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,840
Are you just giving up on your squad now?

928
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,090
If she finishes it, we'll use it.

929
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,949
If not, we march without waiting.

930
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,989
Let fate decide.

931
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,590
Move out!

932
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,190
Xiu.

933
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,760
Mother,

934
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,450
why aren't you asleep yet?

935
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,150
With all this chaos,

936
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,190
how can your father and I sleep?

937
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,690
I made you some millet porridge.

938
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,790
Thank you, Mother.

939
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,790
Warm yourself up.

940
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,360
Have some more. It's millet porriage.

941
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,560
I'll drink it in a bit.

942
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,280
Xiu,

943
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,740
This embroidery of yours—

944
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,760
fine work!

945
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,270
Xiu, you're so talented!

946
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,150
Tietou's doing this for us farmhands—
for our own good.

947
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,280
That...

948
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,390
Farmers' Association thing,

949
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,590
I can't stomach

950
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,880
how Tietou's acting

951
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,670
all high and mighty—

952
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,380
like a toad
pretending to ride a palanquin!

953
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,920
You're here embroidering his flag,

954
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,750
yet he posts guards to watch you!

955
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,160
Xiuxiu... it's not easy for you.

956
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,730
You're stuck between
the landlords' kin on one side,

957
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,070
and us farmhands on the other.

958
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,030
How do you navigate this?

959
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,910
Tell me!

960
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,150
Mother.

961
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,490
You're the one who gets me.

962
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,470
Didn't Tietou himself say—

963
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,880
might not even use the flag?

964
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,960
Yet you're rushing yourself to stitch it?

965
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,850
Right now, I don't want to overthink it.

966
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,980
I just want to embroider this banner—

967
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,070
to do my part
for the Farmers' Association.

968
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,190
If I finish it, good.

969
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,510
If not…

970
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,720
well, I've put effort.

971
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,440
Director.

972
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,470
How's the gathering going?

973
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,470
Everyone is here.

974
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,340
Baisui Fei's squad, 27 people.

975
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,190
Reporting to Chief Tietou:

976
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,280
Niu Wu's squad, 28 people.

977
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,090
Okay... 28 people.

978
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,540
Gu Zhiquan's squad, 16 people,

979
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,200
Fei Qiansheng's squad has 20.

980
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,150
Great!

981
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,000
Alright.

982
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,510
We move out

983
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,780
at first light.

984
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,720
Okay.
Good.

985
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,920
San.

986
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:01,880
San!

987
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
We're moving out!

988
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,070
No more guards!

989
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,630
No more watching?

990
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,360
Yes, hurry up and go!

991
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,690
Okay.

992
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,160
No more watching now?

993
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,050
Where are you going?

994
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,940
I'm feeling a bit worried.

995
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,880
Look at how Tietou's posturing—

996
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,240
he's coming for Ning Xuexiang!

997
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,890
Miser Ning!

998
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,670
I'm getting worried about him.

999
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,160
I'd better go check.

1000
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,840
After all, we're in-laws.

1001
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,040
We should help out if there's anything.

1002
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,960
Mother.

1003
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,150
It's done.

1004
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,110
Let me see.

1005
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,750
It's nice!

1006
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,900
Excellent!

1007
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,290
Sister-in-law.

1008
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,760
I, Feng Tietou, speak for

1009
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,690
the Farmers' Association brothers
when I thank you!

1010
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,290
Listen well, brothers of the Association—

1011
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,580
The time has come

1012
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,470
for us poor farmhands to stand tall!

1013
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,640
When we face the landlords,

1014
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,220
demand permanent tenancy!

1015
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,250
Whoever shouts loudest

1016
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,040
gets to negotiate first!

1017
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,090
He'll secure his rights first!

1018
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,570
With the Farmers' Association
backing you,

1019
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,550
have no fear!

1020
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,840
Today,

1021
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,320
we'll head to the Ning Residence first.

1022
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,150
Move out!

1023
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,720
Move out!

1024
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,760
I'll go along and see what happens.

1025
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,780
You go home first,

1026
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,130
and I'll let you know
if anything happens.

1027
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,740
Dazi, what are you watching there?

1028
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,700
Come on, join us!

1029
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,540
Join the Farmers' Association!
You'll never go hungry!

1030
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,070
-You'll never go hungry!
-You'll never go hungry!

1031
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,700
-Give me a badge!
-Give me a badge!

1032
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,120
Here!

1033
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,590
Join the Farmers' Association!

1034
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,740
You'll never go hungry!

1035
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
You'll never go hungry!

1036
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,320
Join the Farmers' Association!
You'll never go hungry!

1037
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,760
You'll never go hungry!

1038
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,830
Returning from the county town,

1039
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,630
my heart kept swinging

1040
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,320
between hope and dread.
Hope,

1041
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,630
Hope, because Mr. Du spoke of

1042
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,430
how the Farmers' Association
backs us farmhands—

1043
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,720
our future finally brightens.

1044
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,400
But dread...

1045
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,360
will Ning Xuexiang
ever voluntarily cut rents,

1046
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,960
slash interest,
and grant permanent tenancy?

1047
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,770
My mind's in turmoil.

1048
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,760
This is unbearable!

1049
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,960
Tietou has really
established the peasant association,

1050
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,020
though this group
looks a bit shabby.

1051
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,760
You've been all over the place.

1052
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,730
What do you think?

1053
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,960
Can this succeed?

1054
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,920
I don't quite know about other places,

1055
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,390
but if our village wants to succeed,

1056
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,180
Tietou needs to give each one

1057
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,800
a pair of pants
that can cover their backsides.

1058
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
You bet.

1059
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,200
Pants!

1060
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,990
Humpback Guo.

1061
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,630
Even though
you don't know how to farm,

1062
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,190
our farmers' association
doesn't look down on you..

1063
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,520
Come in, I'll give you a membership badge.

1064
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,590
Thanks, brother.

1065
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,920
But I'll pass.

1066
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,260
I don't farm, but I have pants to wear.

1067
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,020
And my leather shoes fit just fine.

1068
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,520
You're shortsighted.

1069
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,760
Let that old donkey of yours

1070
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,960
keep trudging on!

1071
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,840
Next time you beg to join us,
I'll slam the door in your face!

1072
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,760
Anyone else?

1073
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,300
It's not too late.

1074
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,920
I'll make you a membership badge.

1075
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,240
Join the Farmers' Association!

1076
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,280
You'll never go hungry!

1077
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,510
Join the Farmers' Association!
You'll never go hungry!

1078
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,320
Tietou!

1079
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,650
Zhuzi wants to join too.

1080
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:54,990
Go on!

1081
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,050
When did I say that?

1082
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,070
Go, go!

1083
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,400
Come and get your badge.

1084
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,330
Make him a badge.

1085
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,370
Let's go!

1086
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,380
Count me in!

1087
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,030
Everyone!

1088
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,840
Yes!

1089
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,630
Start drilling!

1090
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,210
Shall we just forget about it?

1091
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,820
They're gone.

1092
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,460
Are you a coward?

1093
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,330
All of you are cowards.

1094
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,400
Brothers, get your weapons!

1095
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,240
Yes, sir!

1096
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Brothers!

1097
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
We're here!

1098
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,890
Since our Ox Temple militia

1099
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,400
was formed,

1100
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,530
it's won countless merits.

1101
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
We protect homes

1102
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,130
from bandits,

1103
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,190
hunt thieves,

1104
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,470
and guard this land's peace!

1105
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,720
To troublemakers—

1106
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:24,840
what do we do?

1107
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,090
Beat them till none return!

1108
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,020
To those who bully the weak
or defy authority—what do we do?

1109
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,080
Beat them till they scream for mercy!

1110
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,520
Brothers, fear not—

1111
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,860
your moment to stand tall has come!

1112
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,900
Hold your ground!

1113
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,630
Tietou. Do you want to practice together?

1114
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,600
I'm looking for Ning Xuexiang!

1115
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,840
Tell him to come out.

1116
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,840
Tietou, we'll talk later.

1117
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,190
Brothers!

1118
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:58,990
Yes!

1119
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,540
Let's start training!

1120
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,390
Yes, sir!

1121
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,230
Tietou, this is going to be brutal.

1122
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,230
I'm leaving now.
