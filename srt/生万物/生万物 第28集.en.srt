00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,950
Although these sage seedlings are
late to harvest and plant,

4
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,150
Chang Chun says they are

5
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,080
of good quality.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,009
You can harvest them now if you want to.

7
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,330
If you want to keep them,

8
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,680
we can cover them in winter

9
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,479
and wait until

10
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,200
they turn green again
next spring to harvest.

11
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,370
I just want to tell your father

12
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
that growing sage

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,740
doesn't bring any jinxes.

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,880
I also want to tell those
who plan to grow sage with you

15
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,850
that this crop is easy to cultivate

16
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,020
and harvest, just as you said.

17
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,079
No more "thanks," okay?

18
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,000
P-Put me down. Hey...

19
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,360
Don't step on the seedlings!

With Dajiao's help,

22
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,600
the sage seedlings were growing
better and better.

23
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,870
I've also led the fellow villagers
to grow them together.

24
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,400
During those chaotic times,

25
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,590
these sage seedlings gave us

Sister-in-law,

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
we don't need to worry.

81
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,000
Our family surely has food.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,159
Don't we have several granaries
of surplus grain?

83
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,070
We have fewer mouths to feed.

84
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,250
Even if there's a severe drought
with no harvest this year,

85
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,080
we can still pull through, right?

C-Come on, don't talk like that.

87

Can't you say something positive?

88
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,110
Like, we'll have
a bumper harvest this year?

89
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,630
Also, you must not repeat

90
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,490
what you just said to anyone else.

91
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,690
Who told you we have

92
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,540
several granaries of surplus grain?

93
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,630
Did you see it yourself?

94
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,430
It's not true.

95
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,510
After all these years of famine,

96
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,600
we can't even harvest 50% of the crops,

97
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,330
and even less can be left for us.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You know what?

99
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,880
Our granaries are already half empty.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Seriously?

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Why would I lie to you?

102

Wendian is away from home.

103
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,720
I wonder how he's doing.

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,180
Does he have enough to eat?

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,580
It's been six months

106
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,040
since his last letter, hasn't it?

107
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,650
Didn't his last letter say he got

108
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,750
a high position
at the Provincial Education Department?

109
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,490
With such a good job,
how could he possibly starve?

110
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,420
He's probably eating delicacies.

111
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,000
If he's not writing,

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,270
he's probably just busy.

113
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,680
What could he be so busy with

114
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,340
that he doesn't even have time
to write a letter?

115
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,800
When we finally got a letter,

116
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,510
it was so hastily written.

117
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,380
Just a few lines,

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
telling me to do

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,860
all sorts of things

120
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,540
without saying anything about himself.

121
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,870
Sister-in-law,

122
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,040
you put so much effort into raising him,

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,720
just hoping he'd be successful

124
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,920
and bring honor to the Fei family, right?

125
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,360
Now he's working
in the provincial capital

126
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,830
just as you wished.

127
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,320
Don't overthink it.

128
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
I don't have time to think about him.

129
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,070
Today,

130
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,650
Beard Liu and Qing
hired some tenant farmers

131
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,290
to fetch water
from the Shu River for irrigation.

132
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,690
I need to go check on them.

133
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,680
The seedlings are almost wilting.

134
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,390
I'm afraid the Shu River
will also dry up in a few days.

135
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,590
Will you come with me?

136
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,040
I won't go for the irrigation.

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,750
I don't know how to help.

138
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,830
I'd just be a burden.

139
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,830
I'll stay at home.

140
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,659
But I won't be idle here.

141
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,530
I'll help you check the books.

142
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,000
I've gotten quite good

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
at sorting out accounts now.

144
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,170
Okay.

145
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
You handle the accounts.

146
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,300
Be careful.

147
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,060
Hey, Xiuxiu.

148
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,090
Mother.

149
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,730
I'm coming.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,460
Everyone, take a break
and have something to eat!

151
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:00,850
Okay.

152
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,600
We planned ahead today.

153
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,070
Two buns per person,

154
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,270
and one bowl of cornmeal soup.

155
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,230
-And we used an extra handful of cornmeal.
-Xiu.

156
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
In my opinion,

157
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Xiuxiu's idea is brilliant!

158
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,070
Everyone fetching water together
and watering each family's field,

159
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,830
these seedlings

160
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,560
can definitely get watered twice.

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,150
Right?

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,800
If Zhuzi and I had to water by ourselves,

163
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,250
we wouldn't even finish the first round

164
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,130
before the sun and soil

165
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,210
dry up all that water.

166
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,890
Exactly!

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,640
Xiuxiu is so quick-witted.

168
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,580
It's great when everyone waters together.

169
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,040
Come on,

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,760
let me hold you.

171
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,280
See?

172
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,920
Give grandma a break.

173
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,750
I've eaten and finished our work.

174
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,810
Kela, come on over.

175
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,830
Come to Grandma.

176
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,340
Did you hear me?

177
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,900
Oh, no.

178
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,180
More refugees are coming.

179
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,830
Old Man,

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,600
I need to go protect our seedlings
in the field.

181
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,040
Auntie, don't bother.

182
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,800
I think they're just passing by.

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,860
They're not blind.

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,630
They can tell we're in a severe drought.

185
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,720
They can't pull out

186
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,400
the wheat and eat it, right?

187
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,770
Haven't you heard it?

188
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,750
Some people are starving so badly

189
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,280
that they're even eating
tree roots and bark.

190
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,950
Hey, Dajiao.

191
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,860
After eating, go check on our seedlings.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,310
Xiu.

193
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,910
I guess they're looking for

194
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,130
places where the famine isn't so severe,

195
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,430
so they might find wild vegetables
to survive on.

196
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,000
Zhuzi,

197
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,800
I think you should do like me

198
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,190
and build a shelter by the field

199
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,450
to keep watch at night.

200
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,280
Uncle Feng Er!

201
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,290
Feng Si's wife died!

202
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,240
What?

203
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,330
How?

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,220
She starved to death at home.
Please go quickly!

205
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,360
What?

206
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,200
Just half a month ago,

207
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,080
Dajiao gave her half a bag

208
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,580
of cornmeal mixed with sweet potato flour.

209
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,210
Could it be that the refugees stole it?

210
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,150
Everyone knows
her family is in a poor state.

211
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,200
We all saved food for them.

212
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,400
How could she starve to death?

213
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
If she ate sparingly,

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
it should have lasted a month or so.

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,960
Calm down, okay?

216
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,480
Mother,

217
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,960
please watch over Jiaming.

218
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,790
I'll go take a look.

219
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,600
Okay.

220
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,720
How could Auntie Si starve to death?

221
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,210
Don't panic.

222
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,630
How could this happen?

223
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Mother! Mother! Mother!

224
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,720
Mother! Mother! Mother!

225
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,830
Meiwei, don't cry.

226
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,840
Mother! Mother! Get up, Mother!

227
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,000
Look at me.

228
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,720
Meiwei.

229
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,940
Mother! Mother! Let go!

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,270
What happened?

231
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,160
Didn't we already send them

232
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,020
cornmeal and sweet potato flour?

233
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
I just asked Meiwei about it.

234
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,840
You brought them
half a bag of grain, right?

235
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,280
The mother and son
ate their fill and finished it all

236
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,540
after just a few meals.

237
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,050
His mother told him,

238
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,060
"You eat. I'll just lie down.

239
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,920
If I fall asleep, I won't feel hungry."

240
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,440
The boy was starving,

241
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,120
so he went out to look for food.

242
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,240
But when he came back,

243
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,270
she was already gone.

244
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,510
Father.

245
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,280
She was a widow with no guardian.

246
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,890
Then I'll make the decision for her.

247
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,790
Feng Si's wife didn't do evil
like her husband.

248
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,550
So we should at least
get her a simple coffin

249
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,790
and bury her together with Feng Si.

250
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,850
The child is one of the Feng family.

251
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,360
If your family can't afford
to raise him either,

252
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,030
then we'll see which family

253
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,950
can adopt him as their son.

254
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,140
We want him, I...

255
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:35,980
Father.

256
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,650
Although Feng Si

257
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,190
did many evil deeds,

258
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,910
the child is innocent, right?

259
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,670
Besides,

260
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,650
he's also a descendant of our Feng family.

261
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,600
We'll raise him.

262
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,630
Well,

263
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
let's cover her then.

264
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,630
Where's Jiaming?

265
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,090
He's asleep.

266
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Stop sighing!

267
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,550
This is what your family owes us.

268
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
It was your family

269
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,960
who caused the deaths
of my father and mother.

270
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,560
And my brother also ran away.

271
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,250
I'll eat at your expense
until you're broke.

272
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,000
How can you, a little kid,

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
talk like that?

274
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,040
What do you mean
by eating until we're broke?

275
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,990
Come on, let Uncle make it clear.

276
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,200
Back then, your father
led bandits into the village

277
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,650
and was later shot dead by those bandits,

278
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,270
right?

279
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,580
Your mother

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,670
simply starved to death on her own,

281
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,550
right?

282
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,910
Our family pitied you and took you in,

283
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,600
offering you food and shelter.

284
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
You didn't return
a single word of gratitude,

285
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,640
but plenty of hateful talk.
Who taught you that?

286
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,270
Was it your father and mother
who taught you this?

287
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,690
Enough, we don't discipline children
at the dining table.

288
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,960
Say whatever you want
after we finish the meal.

289
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,490
I'm not your son,
so stop telling me what to do.

290
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,040
Where are you going?

291
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,360
What a boy.

292
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,360
He might turn out to be a big trouble
in the future.

293
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,630
Father, he's just a little child.

294
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,120
No need to be so hard on him.

295
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,320
Uncle Si and Auntie Si

296
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,670
had spent their whole lives
just stuffing their faces

297
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,630
and never bothered to teach their son.

298
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,750
Both Niwei and Meiwei
are like wild children.

299
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,930
But now that Meiwei
has come to our family,

300
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,290
it's some sort of fate.

301
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,080
Right?

302
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,510
Yes, have you forgotten?

303
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,270
That year, you asked Dajiao and Xiuxiu

304
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,930
to bring this child back home.

305
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,790
Feng Si's wife was tied up
in the militia's courtyard,

306
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,050
and Meiwei was nearly starving to death.

307
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,000
After bringing him in, you bathed him,

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,030
made him porridge,
and peeled eggs for him.

309
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,670
Exactly.

310
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,320
We haven't said anything yet,

311
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,940
but you're the one complaining.

312
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,200
Who told us that we should keep an heir
for Feng Si's family?

313
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,240
Eat up.

314
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,320
Have fun.

315
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,960
You'll fall asleep on your own
after a while, yeah??

316
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,270
Dajiao.

317
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,140
You should take some time to teach Meiwei

318
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,500
your skills.

319
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,870
What skills?

320
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,170
I only know farming.

321
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,390
I think

322
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,580
Meiwei doesn't have
the temperament for hard work.

323
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,680
That's exactly why I want you
to teach him.

324
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,210
He's your cousin after all.

325
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,110
Yes, he's my cousin.

326
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,550
But I feel like

327
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,020
you care about him even more than I do.

328
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,670
I just think,

329
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,950
if my child has lost his mother,

330
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,350
having a good person teach him skills

331
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,960
to make a living

332
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,160
would make me rest in peace
in the underworld.

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,530
I'll definitely teach him.

334
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,200
You don't need to project this
onto yourself.

335
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,320
Come on, time for bed.

336
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,150
This watering job

337
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,720
looks simple,

338
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,790
but you won't do it right
without learning how.

339
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,950
Listen, Meiwei.

340
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,130
Watering during a drought

341
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,970
requires special techniques.

342
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,400
When you pour water down,

343
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,390
you can't let it evaporate

344
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,720
and let the wheat go thirsty.
You got that?

345
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,060
Let me show you.

346
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,000
I won't learn.

347
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,360
I want to be like my brother,

348
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,080
not farming,

349
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,170
but running around and having fun.

350
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,980
I don't need to learn farming.

351
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,080
How do you know
your brother is out there having fun?

352
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,200
I just know!

353
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,190
He visits me in my dreams.

354
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,650
Even without dreams, I still know.

355
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,600
He'll come to pick me up sooner or later.

356
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,330
I'm just staying
at your place temporarily.

357
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,170
Don't bother doing anything!

358
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,160
Will you eat dinner? Huh?

359
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,700
Yes.

360
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
If you eat, you learn.

361
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,310
-Let’s talk. No violence.
-Look carefully.

362
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,040
What will you eat if you don't farm?

363
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,320
What's this?

364
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,580
Dajiao!

365
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,080
Wendian?

366
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,350
Fei Wendian?

367
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:29,980
Tietou!

368
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,680
Wendian!

369
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,180
Let's go.

370
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,580
Tietou.

371
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,240
You're tanned!

372
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,880
Am I different from before?

373
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,900
Dajiao.

374
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,670
Xiuxiu,

375
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,150
you're now

376
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,150
a mother of two kids?

377
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,710
This is my son!

378
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,790
Your son?

379
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,240
You're a father now?

380
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,440
Say hi to your uncle.

381
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,240
Hello, Uncle.

382
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,040
Good boy.

383
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,510
Good thing you're all here.

384
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,640
I'll tell you first.

385
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
I've come back

386
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,660
to complete a task
from the Education Department.

387
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
That is to restore

388
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,720
teaching at Xiazhuang Elementary School.

389
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,390
This means

390
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,210
from now on, your children

391
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,290
and all children within ten li

392
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,900
will have a place to study.

393
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,210
Xiao Jia and Xinming

394
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,710
are the teachers
who will be teaching the children.

395
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,760
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello, everyone.

396
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,270
Tietou!

397
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,650
Do you want to learn to read?

398
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,000
That's okay!

399
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,580
You can learn alongside the children.

400
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,670
Great!

401
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,180
You're back to teach.

402
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,930
The children are so lucky.

403
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,320
Yes.

404
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,190
Have you been home yet?

405
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,870
Not yet.

406
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,390
Go quickly.

407
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,610
Your sister-in-law and Susu

408
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,620
are missing you.

409
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,240
Right, that's what I was thinking.

410
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,620
I'll go home first, and then go

411
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,630
to the elementary school to register.

412
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,920
Alright then, carry on.

413
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,580
I'm off now.

414
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,810
Come chat with me when you're free.

415
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,920
Sure!

416
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,200
And think about sending your children
to school!

417
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,750
I'm in!

418
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,950
You must join us!

419
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,480
Yes!

420
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,590
Wendian returned
after being gone for a long time,

421
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,200
and he had changed a lot.

422
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,870
Xiuxiu and I both felt

423
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,680
that there was a spark in his eyes

424
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,210
and a certain energy about him.

425
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,099
Later, we realized

426
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,060
that it was due to the change
in his identity.

427
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,680
He had joined the revolutionary force,

428
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,960
the one fighting for the common people,

429
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,180
the Communist Party.

430
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,890
It's been two days already.

431
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,000
They just went to water the plants.

432
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Why have all three of them disappeared?

433
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,520
Sister-in-law!

434
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,200
Sister-in-law!

435
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,740
You're finally back.

436
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,280
Susu.

437
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,920
Why are you back?

438
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,840
I'm back. How are you doing?

439
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,590
I'm doing well.

440
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,960
Jia, Xinming.

441
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,350
Come in.

442
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

443
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,460
Is my sister-in-law not home?

444
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,640
She went to water the main field.

445
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,070
She hasn't been back for two days.

446
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,200
Two days already?

447
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,070
Did Steward Liu and Qing go with her?

448
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,350
She only said
she was going to water the field?

449
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,400
I went to check the field.

450
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,700
I didn't see her or the others.

451
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,950
I only saw tenant farmers
watering the field.

452
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,920
I asked them, but they didn't know either.

453
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,780
Didn't see her?

454
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,970
Well...

455
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,030
Mr. Fei,

456
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,590
after all that fuss,

457
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,070
you haven't introduced her yet.
Who is this?

458
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,450
Should we call her Mrs. Fei?

459
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,720
Susu,

460
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,000
these are my colleagues,

461
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,030
Jia and Xinming.

462
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,040
This is Susu.
As for how you should address her,

463
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
let her decide.

464
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,880
You can just call me Susu.

465
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,960
-OK, Susu.
-Susu.

466
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,710
Come on in.

467
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,570
Is that Wendian who's back?

468
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,530
Sister-in-law!

469
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,360
Susu, is Wendian back?

470
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,520
Sister-in-law!

471
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,790
Wendian!

472
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,640
It really is you!

473
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,550
People told me on the way here

474
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,030
that you were back,
but I couldn't believe it.

475
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,590
Young Master.

476
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,070
Qing!

477
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,750
Look at you...

478
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,240
How did you become like this?

479
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,510
Aren't you serving as an official
at the Provincial Education Department?

480
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,990
You used to have fair skin!

481
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,460
But now you look like a field laborer!

482
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,400
Sister-in-law,

483
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
sometimes we have to

484
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,770
conduct lessons in the fields,

485
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,570
so it's inevitable to get tanned.

486
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,660
But don't you think

487
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,280
I'm more robust than before?

488
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,270
Yes, you've gotten stronger.

489
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,550
Sister-in-law, Susu just told me

490
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,880
you've been gone for two days.

491
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,080
Did anything happen?

492
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,240
What could happen?

493
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,570
Qing and Beard Liu
were with me the whole time.

494
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,100
That day I went to see them
watering the field.

495
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,590
Later, I noticed it was still early,

496
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,860
so I decided to go to the medicine shop
in town to settle some accounts

497
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,350
and ended up staying for two days.

498
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,810
I forgot to have someone
send Susu a message.

499
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,340
Well...

500
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,680
Sister-in-law,

501
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,920
these are my colleagues,

502
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Jia and Xinming.

503
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,350
This is my sister-in-law.

504
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,080
-Hello, Madam.
-Hello, Madam.

505
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,570
Thank you for taking care of Wendian.

506
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,790
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

507
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,250
Not yet.

508
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,880
Qing.

509
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,610
Hurry up.

510
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,200
On my way!

511
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Come sit inside.

512
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,070
Xiaoqin!

513
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,530
Come in.

514
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,730
Father,

515
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,030
take a rest.

516
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,000
Keep it down.

517
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,390
My grandson is sleeping.

518
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,140
Father.

519
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,080
Father.

520
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,650
Despite the drought
reducing our harvest this year,

521
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,570
I still made some money
selling medicinal herbs.

522
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,080
I earned a total of four silver dollars.

523
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,350
I'll keep two,

524
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,570
and the other two

525
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,390
are for you

526
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,240
to save for buying land.

527
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,840
Thank you, Xiu. Look at this.

528
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,160
See?

529
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,000
These years,
Xiuxiu has been growing medicinal herbs

530
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,750
and contributing quite a lot
to our household.

531
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,310
It's nothing.

532
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,020
You've saved more than 10 dollars
for your father

533
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,080
to buy land, right?

534
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,520
Last winter, your father got the idea

535
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,030
to buy land from the land agent,

536
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,070
but I stopped him.

537
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,390
I was thinking that,
during this difficult time,

538
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,310
it was not a good time to buy land.

539
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,760
I got it right! Look,

540
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,070
we had another drought this spring.

541
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,590
Xiu, Dajiao,

542
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,960
don't worry.

543
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,840
When things get better,

544
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,870
I'll definitely go
choose a good piece of land!

545
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,360
Won't you stay a bit longer?

546
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,550
Are you all full?

547
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,880
-Yes.
-I'm full, Madam.

548
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,330
From now on, if you want anything to eat,
just come over.

549
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,780
I'll prepare it for you.

550
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,760
Sister-in-law.

551
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,840
I'm leaving.

552
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,000
Where are you going?

553
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,810
I'm going to the elementary school
to sign in!

554
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,510
I came back

555
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,980
just to let you take a look at me

556
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,110
and to reassure you.

557
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,690
Xiazhuang isn't that far away.

558
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,010
Can't you stay at home?

559
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,000
As the lead teacher,

560
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,700
I need to stay
with all the other teachers.

561
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,160
I have to follow the rules.

562
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,160
Don't worry, when I have time,

563
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,560
I'll come back to see you.

564
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,590
Jia, Xinming.

565
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,930
You two go ahead and wait for me.

566
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,090
Alright!

567
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,150
Madam, we'll take our leave.

568
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,520
Come by again.

569
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,400
Susu,

570
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,700
are you interested in this?

571
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,130
Alright, I'll come back in a few days
to teach you.

572
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,120
Sister-in-law.

573
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,800
The disasters are hitting hard.

574
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,590
Perhaps by next year or the year after,

575
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,440
there will be even greater difficulties.

576
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,450
With this drought
plus the other disasters,

577
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,550
many people have become homeless.

578
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,070
Some are even selling their kids
as they can't afford to survive.

579
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,680
Our family still needs to save
where we can.

580
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,810
Especially with food, we must be frugal.

581
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,720
She knows.
She's being very economical now.

582
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,780
And I'm not ordering dishes anymore.

583
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,880
Good, Sister-in-law.

584
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,440
I'll be going then.

585
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,810
Try to come back more often.

586
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,410
Of course!

587
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,920
I'll come back to help you with the work.

588
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,160
Take care.

589
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,660
Okay!

590
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,860
Why can't he stay at home?

591
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
How about I pack your bedding,

592
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,490
and you go with Wendian?

593
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,500
Wendian!

594
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,000
Sister-in-law, where should I go?

595
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,030
Your husband is back!

596
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,630
Shouldn't you stay with him?

597
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,340
You're not expecting me
to have a child again, are you?

598
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,310
I've already said
I won't force you anymore.

599
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,750
I'll keep my word.

600
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,570
Well.

601
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,750
Wendian now has to teach

602
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,920
and work in the fields.

603
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
He needs someone to take care of him.

604
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,830
It's improper for me to go now.

605
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,750
Why not?

606
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,420
Taking care
of your husband is only natural.

607
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,720
But according to what Wendian said,

608
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,310
he doesn't even know where he'll sleep.

609
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,040
What would I do if I went with him?

610
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,090
What do you mean?

611
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,970
You'll sleep wherever he sleeps!

612
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
Fine, I agree.

613
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,000
I can go.

614
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,240
But can I go tomorrow
to check the situation first

615
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,370
before I pack my bedding? Is that okay?

616
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,970
That works.

617
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,640
You go take a look tomorrow

618
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,900
and see what's needed.

619
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
Later, I'll have Qing

620
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,310
pack everything up
and send it over to you both.

621
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,680
Okay.

622
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,200
-Hello?
-Anybody there?

623
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,370
Is anyone home?

624
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Come on, this way.

625
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,720
Ma'am.

626
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,530
P-Please open the door.

627
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,640
Please take pity on us, ma'am.

628
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,440
Could I have some water?

629
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,200
-Beggars.
-Ma'am.

630
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,000
Could you spare some water?

631
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,110
Ma'am.

632
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,100
There's a well
at the west end of the village.

633
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,710
Go there and drink all you want.

634
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,510
Go on.

635
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,310
Ma'am.

636
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,280
Please have mercy on us, ma'am.

637
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I-I'll sell you my little boy.

638
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,400
H-He'll soon be a good laborer.

639
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,040
I don't want money, ma'am.

640
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,150
J-Just give us something to eat.

641
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,000
Ma'am,

642
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
we haven't eaten for days.

643
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,290
Without food,

644
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,030
the three of us will soon starve to death.

645
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,790
Please, ma'am.

646
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,400
Mother.

647
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,640
W-Wait here.

648
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,920
Move along.

649
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,200
Stop pushing.

650
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,920
Don't push!

651
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,330
It's wasted, look.

652
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,240
Come back after you finish it.

653
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,050
There's some for you.

654
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,000
W-Wait. Take it slow.

655
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,720
Stay out! Don't come in!

656
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,560
There's none left! Really!

657
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,640
Father!

658
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,470
Don't do this!

659
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,200
Father!

660
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,070
Father.

661
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,420
What are you all doing?

662
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,230
In these hard times,

663
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
everyone's struggling to get by.

664
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,110
If we give you all our food,

665
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,590
what will we eat?

666
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,030
Leave now. Leave.

667
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,310
-Please give us a bit more.
-Yeah.

668
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,920
No way!

669
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,770
There's nothing left.

670
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,130
Leave!

671
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,780
Stop pushing.

672
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,940
Please, just a little more food.

673
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,780
There's none left! Don't push!

674
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,310
Just a little more, please.

675
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
How many times must I tell you?

676
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,070
Don't push! Stay out!

677
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,440
Father!

678
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,070
Stay out! Don't come in!

679
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,130
What are you doing?

680
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,070
Everyone, leave!

681
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,510
Go!

682
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,200
We're not rich either.

683
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,680
I have mouths to feed, too.

684
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,060
Why isn't that child leaving?

685
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,240
Wait, madam.

686
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,750
Are you abandoning that child?

687
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,350
Come on.

688
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,090
Follow your mother.

689
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,590
I've s-sold him to you as we agreed.

690
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,510
H-His name is Suozhu.
He's seven years old.

691
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,240
He'll survive merely on your leftovers.

692
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
We won't take your child.
Please take him with you.

693
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,610
I'm just trying to survive.

694
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,720
I won't come back for him.

695
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,050
P-Please just keep him.

696
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,190
Father, she's even selling her child.

697
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,310
Let's give them some more food, Mother.

698
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,440
In these hard times,

699
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,300
if we give them our food,
what will we eat?

700
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,590
Besides, this is nothing rare nowadays.

701
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,880
Can you help them all?

702
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,920
Just this once.

703
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,200
Hurry and leave.

704
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,030
Off you go.

705
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:36,400
Thank you.

706
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,930
Take this for the children.

707
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,900
Thank you so much.

708
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,620
Let's go.

709
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,720
Hurry.

710
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,920
Let's stay out of such trouble. See?

711
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,940
They almost broke down our door.

712
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,240
I was terrified.

713
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,050
Miss, please give me something to eat.

714
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,250
I don't have any food! Hands off me!

715
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,560
I don't have any food! I don't!

716
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,970
Please have mercy! Please!

717
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,880
Give me something to eat.

718
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,980
Ma'am, I don't have any food.
Stop chasing me!

719
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,110
Humpback Guo!

720
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,390
What's wrong?

721
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,210
Zhuzi, what happened to Humpback Guo?

722
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,720
His wife passed away.

723
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,310
She'd been sick for a while
and failed to pull through.

724
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,840
She's in a better place now.

725
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,130
I just feel sorry for Humpback Guo.

726
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,330
From now on, he'll be a lonely widower.

727
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,750
Here.

728
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,200
Let me heat it up for you.

729
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,600
Don't bother. It's fine.

730
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,760
You have no idea.

731
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,050
Mother and I were at home today

732
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,850
and almost got robbed
by those disaster refugees.

733
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,980
Didn't I tell you to lock the doors?

734
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,010
We did.

735
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,440
You just didn't see

736
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,070
how tragic it was.

737
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,850
Just for a bite of food,

738
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,010
someone wanted to sell her child to us.

739
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,720
Xiuxiu.

740
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Brother-in-law!

741
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,470
What brings you here?

742
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,600
I was missing Jiaming,
so I came to see him.

743
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,650
Jiaming just went to his grandma's room.

744
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,710
He'll be back soon.

745
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,070
H-Have you eaten?

746
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,790
Yes, I have.

747
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,140
Then

748
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,170
have a seat.

749
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,110
Xiuxiu, on my way here,

750
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,170
I saw Humpback Guo.

751
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,200
His wife died.

752
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,580
Zhuzi and the others went to help
with the burial.

753
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,440
Humpback Guo seems
like a different person.

754
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,240
He doesn't even joke around anymore.

755
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,200
Zhuzi said

756
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,940
Humpback Guo would have a hard time

757
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,340
living alone from now on.

758
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,020
Humpback Guo's wife is gone.

759
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,030
Why didn't he ask for help?

760
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,910
It's the village custom.

761
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
For someone who's suffered
from illness their whole life,

762
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,970
we don't keep them lingering. The sooner
they're buried, the sooner they're reborn.

763
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,350
What's wrong?
Do you have something on your mind?

764
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,010
I just wanted to chat with you.

765
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,030
I'll go eat in the kitchen.

766
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,550
Take a seat.

767
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,130
What's wrong? Tell me about it.

768
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,460
It's nothing serious.

769
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,310
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

770
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,510
Just tell me quickly,

771
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,590
and then your brother-in-law
can walk you home.

772
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,250
It's chaotic out there at night
with all those disaster refugees.

773
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,820
Xiuxiu,

774
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,950
did you know Wendian is back?

775
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,440
Of course I know。

776
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,660
Now you two can finally
spend time together.

777
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't know what to do.

778
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,820
He's not even staying at home.

779
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,110
My sister-in-law told me
to pack my bedding

780
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,160
and go with Wendian
to Xiazhuang Elementary School.

781
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I managed to give her the runaround,

782
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,930
but I don't know what to do next.

783
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,720
Then I have to ask you

784
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,510
what's on your mind.

785
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Before,

786
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,680
I thought Wendian was just a pretty boy

787
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
obsessed with his poetry and books,

788
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,270
not capable at all.

789
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,660
But he's like a different person
when he's back this time.

790
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,630
He's more manly, like he's grown up.

791
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,290
Even his voice has more power.

792
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,090
Wendian does seem to have changed.

793
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,000
I didn't care much for him before,

794
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
and he hurt me when he left last time.

795
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,610
I thought if he came back this time,

796
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,140
I would break ties with him

797
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,760
and make it clear between us.

798
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,030
But he's different now,

799
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,440
and my thoughts are all over the place.

800
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,510
When all is said and done,

801
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,550
it's up to you.

802
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,200
You need to accept him and like him.

803
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,940
You two never really had a chance

804
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,270
to get to know each other properly before.

805
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,110
Now that

806
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,880
he's back, give it another try.

807
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,730
Then I'll give it another try?

808
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,200
Go ahead and try.

809
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,200
I really hope you can settle down.

810
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,170
Dajiao! Xiuxiu!

811
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,070
Are you home?

812
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,930
What's going on?

813
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,340
Dajiao!

814
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,160
Xiuxiu!

815
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,670
What's up?

816
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,110
Wendian asked you
to come to my house for a meeting.

817
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Judging by his manner,

818
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,130
it seems to be of great importance.

819
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,870
A meeting?

820
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,270
Tietou said I wanted to hold a meeting.

821
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,920
Actually,

822
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,810
it's not really a meeting.

823
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I just want

824
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,160
to tell you, the people I trust most,

825
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,420
the real reason I've come back this time.

826
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,370
Let me tell you about myself first.

827
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,710
I've joined the Chinese Workers'
and Peasants' Red Army

828
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,110
and become a member
of the Communist Party.

829
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,030
Jia and Xinming

830
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,280
are my comrades.

831
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,790
We came back

832
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,550
disguised as elementary school teachers,

833
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,440
but we're actually here to complete

834
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,830
a mission assigned
by the Southern Shandong

835
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,360
Revolutionary Committee.

836
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,920
Recently, you must have all noticed

837
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,440
how serious the disasters

838
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,770
have become in our area.

839
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,830
Looking at the whole country,

840
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,430
our area isn't the only place
suffering badly.

841
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,630
The Yellow River region is flooding.

842
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,850
The Yangtze River area is in drought.

843
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,040
Even the water-rich regions

844
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,280
have turned into scorched earth.

845
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,970
Countless disaster refugees have died

846
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,970
with bodies everywhere.

847
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,680
In some places,

848
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,350
eating and selling human flesh

849
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,350
has become a way to survive.

850
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,610
There are even cases of people
exchanging children to eat.

851
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,810
What does that mean?

852
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,160
The newspaper says

853
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,420
that some disaster refugees
couldn't bear to eat their own children,

854
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,420
so they exchanged children
with others to eat.

855
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,890
I-It's come to this point?

856
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,350
But what is the Kuomintang doing?

857
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,740
They're busy strengthening their power.

858
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,600
They're busy seizing territory!

859
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,720
They couldn't care less

860
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,380
about common people's lives,

861
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,630
but we common people need to survive!

862
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,950
We must rise up and resist.

863
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,690
Just tell us what to do!
We'll follow you.

864
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,540
Make the wealthy landlords
open their granaries

865
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,740
for disaster relief.

866
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,880
What if these landlords

867
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,280
refuse to cooperate

868
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,200
and won't release the grain? What then?

869
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,790
Like Ning Xuexiang and Ning Kejin,

870
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,030
his son is protecting him.

871
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,680
So to guard against

872
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,920
militia organizations like Ning Kejin's,

873
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,880
we need to build our own forces.

874
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,780
Tietou, you've

875
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,590
organized the Farmers' Association.

876
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,640
I hope you can secretly gather

877
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,070
all the friends from the Association,

878
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,530
ready to help us
open the granaries anytime.

879
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,160
Don't worry about

880
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,960
militia organizations like Ning Kejin's.

881
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,070
If necessary,

882
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,960
the First Column of the Southern Shandong
Revolution Committee

883
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,680
will support our operations.

884
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,410
Then we can achieve our ultimate goal,

885
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,270
defeating the landlords' forces,
seizing weapons,

886
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,790
confiscating the landlords' grain,

887
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,850
and distributing it
to farmers and disaster refugees.

888
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,270
Brilliant!

889
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,440
I'll follow your lead.

890
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,310
Just rest assured.

891
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,910
I'm at your command anytime.

892
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,110
Wendian.

893
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,430
What can Xiuxiu

894
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,940
and I do to help you?

895
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,340
Dajiao.

896
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,490
I hope you and Xiuxiu

897
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,840
can convince Ning Xuexiang
to open the granaries voluntarily

898
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,170
and persuade Ning Kejin

899
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,270
to give up resisting, drop his weapons,

900
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,870
and ideally join our forces.

901
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,930
Count me in, too.

902
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,660
I'll go with you
to persuade our sister-in-law.

903
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,270
Xiuxiu and her husband
can persuade my father.

904
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,510
If my father opens the granaries,

905
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,600
Li Junyi will do the same.

906
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,960
He always listens to my father.

907
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,440
Susu,

908
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,100
you're absolutely right.

909
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,860
I got it.

910
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,960
For the sake of those disaster victims
and those people who are alive,

911
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,800
Dajiao and I

912
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,679
will do our best
to persuade Ning Xuexiang.

913
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,270
Thank you.

914
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,280
Father!

915
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,000
Father,

916
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,280
if you had equipped my troops
with these earlier,

917
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,230
be it bandits or disaster refugees,

918
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,989
I wouldn't fear anyone coming our way.

919
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,790
Each of these iron pieces
costs 80 silver dollars,

920
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,610
enough to buy three or four mu
of good land.

921
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,159
You have no idea how it made my heart
ache to spend so much.

922
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,840
This one is also great, Father.

923
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,230
You surely didn't pay for it all yourself.

924
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,920
Did four or five families chip in?

925
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,250
I contributed the most.

926
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,310
Well, you also have
the most land and grain.

927
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,540
Father, with these weapons,

928
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,840
anyone coveting your grain

929
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,240
or trying to steal it

930
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,350
will have to take a detour
when they see our militia.

931
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,460
What are you doing?

932
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,770
Let me check it out.

933
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,010
You didn't have to walk me home.

934
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm not afraid of walking at night.

935
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,710
Given the turbulence around here now,

936
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,070
it's not safe for you
to walk alone at night.

937
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,400
Are you caring about me?

938
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,030
Susu.

939
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,030
You know I came back this time

940
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,000
with a mission.

941
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,450
After this mission is completed,

942
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,200
I'll have to leave again.

943
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,140
As for when I'll be back next time,

944
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,010
I'm not sure either.

945
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
So I want to

946
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,590
sort things out between us.

947
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,910
I can't waste your time anymore.

948
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,970
You escorted me back home

949
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,130
just to tell me this?

950
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,450
Then tell me.

951
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,170
If I really got knocked up
by you last time,

952
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,590
would you still
talk about breaking up now?

953
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,680
My sister said

954
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,820
marrying into your family
is better than any other.

955
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,190
We know each other well,
and you're a good person.

956
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,070
I've thought it over.

957
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,070
These are all good points.

958
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,330
I should listen to her.

959
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,440
Besides,

960
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,310
it's not like
I can't find someone else to marry.

961
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,590
Susu, that's not what I meant.

962
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,590
Wendian,

963
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,900
our relationship

964
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,210
isn't up to us.

965
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,820
If you want to change anything,

966
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,950
you need to talk to our sister-in-law.

967
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,110
Are you coming in?

968
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,860
Let's sit down
and talk it through properly.

969
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,280
Susu,

970
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
your destiny

971
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,380
should be in your own hands.

972
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,710
I won't go inside.

973
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,840
I have a meeting
with Jia and the others back there.

974
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,050
Fei Wendian,

975
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,460
listen carefully.

976
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,160
You haven't wasted my time.

977
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,800
I'll help you with your great cause first.

978
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,850
As for our relationship,

979
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,310
let's talk about it later.

980
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,510
Susu?

981
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,590
Sister-in-law, what are you doing here?

982
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,440
Where have you been?

983
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,770
Why are you back so late?

984
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,420
I was about to send Beard Liu
to look for you.

985
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,230
I've been to Xiuxiu's place.

986
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,000
It's so chaotic outside these days.

987
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,030
Next time, tell me where you're going

988
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,490
and take someone with you.

989
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,010
Wendian walked me back,
so I wasn't scared.

990
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,110
Where is Wendian then?

991
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,710
Why didn't he come in with you?

992
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,070
Wendian went back to have a meeting

993
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,530
for something important.

994
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,490
What could be so important?

995
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,850
He's just teaching
a couple of kids how to write.

996
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,290
Alright, let's eat now.

997
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,850
Sister-in-law,

998
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,000
please stay a bit longer.

999
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,860
I also have something to tell you.

1000
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,650
He's asleep?

1001
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,170
Yeah.

1002
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,320
You were right.

1003
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,110
Wendian

1004
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,840
is indeed different now.

1005
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,380
Do you really think

1006
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,740
you can persuade your father
to open the granaries?

1007
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,800
I'm not sure either.

1008
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,800
But I just feel that

1009
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,710
grain isn't like land.

1010
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,280
Once land is given away, it's gone.

1011
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,510
But grain can grow again next year.

1012
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,590
Ning Xuexiang must understand it.

1013
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,180
Look at those disaster refugees.

1014
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,070
They are all suffering terribly.

1015
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,340
Anyone would feel compelled to help.

1016
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,790
Right after hearing what Wendian said,

1017
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,980
I wanted to rush straight to Ning Xuexiang

1018
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,240
to talk sense into him.

1019
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,880
If you really want to do it,
I'll go with you

1020
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,000
to back you up.

1021
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
I'm not afraid of him.

1022
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,810
No need for that.

1023
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,550
I just think

1024
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,760
I need a strategy for this.

1025
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,070
If he says no to my face,

1026
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,800
things will reach a deadlock.

1027
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,790
I'm thinking about

1028
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,850
going to persuade Kejin first tomorrow.

1029
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,880
Let's try to get him

1030
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,510
to join Wendian's forces.

1031
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,230
After that,
opening the granaries won't be a problem.

1032
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,030
I only found out
when I saw Wendian this time

1033
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,030
that he came back

1034
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,250
to persuade wealthy families
to open their granaries.

1035
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,070
I've already discussed it with Wendian.

1036
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,530
He and I will persuade you;

1037
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,140
Xiuxiu will persuade my father.

1038
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,710
Let's help those disaster refugees.

1039
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,910
The food we offer them

1040
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,650
will help them survive, right?

1041
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,410
Wendian came back this time

1042
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,590
to lead us in opening our granaries
and giving away food?

1043
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,920
Never mind whether he's leading it or not.

1044
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
It's just the right thing to do.

1045
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,280
Sister-in-law,
those poor disaster refugees

1046
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,540
are starving to death.

1047
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,670
If we have grain, we should share it.

1048
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,840
Sister-in-law, if you open your granaries,

1049
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,710
you'll be the first in Ox Temple Village

1050
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,320
to distribute grain to the needy.

1051
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,110
When word gets out,

1052
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,770
it'll bring honor to Wendian!

1053
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,590
I'll have Wendian
and the disaster refugees

1054
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,550
present you
with the largest plaque of honor,

1055
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,000
and Wendian will personally
hang it in the ancestral hall.

1056
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,960
How wonderful.

1057
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,730
As if I care about your plaque.

1058
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,410
I have no grain.

1059
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,400
How can you not have any?

1060
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Didn't I tell you last time?

1061
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,130
Our granaries are already half empty.

1062
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,440
Well, if there's really none,

1063
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,900
I'll have to tell Wendian
about it tomorrow.

1064
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,550
Go ahead!

1065
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,510
Take your bedding when you go.

1066
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,670
Uncle Liu.

1067
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,760
Last time when Madam

1068
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,020
cleared out the pharmacy shelves,

1069
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,880
didn't we already
deliver a batch of grain?

1070
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,000
Why do we need to move more?

1071
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,800
Madam said not to keep any at home.

1072
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,110
We should move it all away.

1073
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,710
Wait, if we

1074
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,830
don't keep any, what will we eat?

1075
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,340
Just keep enough rations
for two or three months.

1076
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,140
Oh, by the way,

1077
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,060
Madam told me to remind you

1078
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,190
to keep it a secret from everyone,

1079
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,400
especially from the Young Master.

1080
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,130
Understand?

1081
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,430
Alright, say no more.

1082
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,730
Hurry up. Lift it.

1083
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,130
Father?

1084
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,110
Why don't you come in?

1085
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,250
What's wrong?

1086
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,420
We're almost out of food.

1087
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,280
How did you eat so fast?

1088
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,070
As you know,

1089
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,710
your Second Uncle
came to our home as a refugee,

1090
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,760
adding three more mouths to feed!

1091
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,040
They haven't left yet?

1092
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,590
Your mother can't bear to drive them away.

1093
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,590
He sticks around and refuses to leave.

1094
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,920
What am I supposed to do?

1095
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,710
At this time of year,

1096
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,720
they should be working
in their wheat fields.

1097
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,120
Only after planting can they harvest food.

1098
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,800
How can they be freeloading at our place?

1099
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,330
Your uncle told your mother

1100
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,040
that you're now lying on a pile of grain.

1101
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,640
The crumbs that fall when you turn over

1102
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,710
would be enough for them.

1103
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,840
Nonsense!

1104
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,310
You know it very well.

1105
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,920
He grips the granary keys
even while sleeping.

1106
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,050
It takes me so much effort
to ask him for grain every time.

1107
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,670
Well,

1108
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,530
then...

1109
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,050
Can y-you

1110
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,590
beg him

1111
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,250
or sweet-talk him?

1112
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,360
You can surely figure out a way.

1113
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,800
Y-You...

1114
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,190
Y-You say some sweet words to him.

1115
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,030
Or I can teach you how.

1116
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,360
If he doesn't give you grain,

1117
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,170
tell him you're going back
to your parents' home.

1118
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,280
You're carrying his child now!

1119
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,780
He'll surely send food over.

1120
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,510
If he still refuses to give food,

1121
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,430
then don't come back to his house

1122
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,100
and just starve his child.

1123
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,280
Father!

1124
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,040
What kind of advice a-are you giving?

1125
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,070
My advice...

1126
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:07,920
I...
