1
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,519
They will ignore my orders.

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,399
To assassinate Qin Molin,

3
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,000
it's all your order, right?

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,879
I did it for the good of His Majesty,

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,760
who refused to kill Qin Molin,

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,760
I'm afraid he's selfish.

7
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,879
I admit that I do have selfish motives.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,840
But for our great cause of recovery,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,560
it's also good for us.

10
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,520
If I can marry Qin Molin

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
and give birth to a prince to inherit the throne.

12
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,399
Xia Dou is also in my hands.

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,840
It doesn't cost a single soldier.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,240
Isn't it the best choice?

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,320
Well,

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,520
Su Jinxia,

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,079
what do you want to do with it?

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,840
Kill, of course.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
Stupid woman.

20
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,239
Your Excellency,

21
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,799
Her Majesty has other thoughts.

22
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm afraid it will affect the cause of recovery.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,599
I have other thoughts.

24
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,560
Just change to someone who doesn't have the heart.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,359
Instead of her,

26
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,439
but,

27
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,079
The previous dynasty only left a trace of the princess's blood.

28
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,239
If I say she's a princess,

29
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,280
she's a princess.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,879
If I say she's not,

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,640
she's not.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,239
Got it?

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,280
I understand.

34
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,639
Since I was sensible,

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,199
I knew I had a special identity,

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
Princess of the previous dynasty,

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,800
my existence,

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,479
It's for revenge.

39
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,000
For my father, whom I've never met before,

40
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,759
since I was a child,

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,120
I received all kinds of training,

42
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,840
even obsequiousness.

43
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,960
You also need to learn,

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,479
finally

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,840
When I was an adult,

46
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,240
I received

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,319
the most important task in my life,

48
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,400
Approaching King Lin'an,

49
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,400
Qin Molin

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520
saw Qin Mo temporarily,

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,439
I froze,

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,319
because this was not the first time I had seen him.

53
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,280
The first time we met,

54
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,439
it was at the most awkward time in my life.

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,879
Miss,

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,360
what's wrong with you?

57
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,159
Are you okay?

58
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,840
Miss.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,639
His appearance

60
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,159
is deeply imprinted in my mind.

61
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,360
This is the first time,

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,319
and the only time

63
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,879
I feel warm.

64
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,560
Yeyi,

65
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,159
take her to the inn.

66
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:55,919
Yes.

67
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,680
Master,

68
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,159
I've been thinking,

69
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,120
When can I see him again?

70
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,840
I didn't expect

71
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,039
to see him again,

72
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,639
He turned out to be my target.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,319
My princess

74
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,240
is just a chess piece on the chessboard,

75
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
I can't help it.

76
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,519
Little lady.

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,680
If you walk here alone,

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
I'm afraid you'll be lonely,

79
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,879
Let me accompany you.

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,519
Even if it's a chess piece,

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,519
not everyone can control it.
