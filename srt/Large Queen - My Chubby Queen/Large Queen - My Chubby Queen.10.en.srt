1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,519
Madam,

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,599
Madam,

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,640
Boss,

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,719
You,

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,399
You're married.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,480
In a sense,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,120
I did get married.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,480
I've done it twice.

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,399
What?

10
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,000
My first husband

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,439
died on his wedding night.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,240
The second one

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,439
is now lying in bed with serious injuries.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
Jinxia

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Jinxia,

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,480
oh my god.

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,719
Boss got married.

18
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,480
And he was cursed.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,799
Those who are with him,

20
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,680
will encounter misfortune.

21
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,400
No.

22
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,200
It must be because

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,959
they are not true love.

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,519
The curse can only be resolved by true love.

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,280
Yes.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm the one who can make Boss

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,920
The man who broke the curse.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,239
I have to bear

29
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,560
all the pain.

30
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,760
Humph.

31
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:06,959
Pearl,

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,760
are you done cooking?

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,560
Bring it in.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,800
You scared me to death.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,479
What are you doing?

36
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,159
Are you trying to scare me to death?

37
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,039
Inherit my flowers?

38
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,439
Flowers.

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,319
It doesn't matter.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Boss,

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,240
can I ask you a question?

42
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,479
What's the problem?

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,479
Will you get married for the third time?

44
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,879
Well,

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
of course.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,400
No, I won't.

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,360
Hum,

48
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm not dead yet.

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
Of course my wife won't get married.

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,800
I'll go.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,960
Is this the legendary little fresh meat?

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,960
So sexy.

53
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,520
In modern times,

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,879
it must be top-notch.

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,599
Let's put on an ancient puppet show.

56
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,280
I'm sure the fire will turn upside down.

57
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,639
Let us

58
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,120
drama-chasing otaku who are hit hard by ugly men

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
in ancient costumes every day,

60
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,680
You can also wash your eyes.

61
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:11,919
Hum,

62
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,800
He's as thin as a horse pole,

63
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,199
with no flesh on his face,

64
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,639
I can't even shake it.

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,879
He's not worthy of my boss.

66
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,680
You don't wear clothes well,

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,479
but you're open-minded,

68
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,479
If you don't behave like a man,

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,719
you're not like me.

70
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,599
So perfect.

71
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,120
Pearl,

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,599
have a seat.

73
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,479
Ah.

74
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,360
If your lady asks you to sit down,

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,159
just sit down.

76
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,560
Have a seat.

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,039
Yes.

78
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,400
Let's eat.

79
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,280
Why aren't you eating?

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
It's so delicious.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Madam,

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
eat slowly.

83
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,079
I told you

84
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,160
to eat slowly.

85
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,600
You've been greedy

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,319
since you were a child.

87
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,680
There's nothing I can do about you.

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,519
What trick is Qin Molin playing?

89
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,439
His Majesty is so nice to you,

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,160
indeed as expected,

91
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,439
His Majesty married you because he likes you.

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,519
Wu Yue,

93
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,240
are you okay?

94
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,920
The wind is strong today

95
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,040
and the old disease recurs.

96
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:02,720
Well,

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,240
Let me take you back to your room.

98
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,199
Your Majesty,

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,240
Childe Qin,

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,079
Blood,

101
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,079
Blood,

102
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,959
Are you okay?

103
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,000
What do you think?

104
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,399
Pearl,

105
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,079
help him back to his room.

106
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,839
Okay,

107
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,720
Come on,

108
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,560
Come on,

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,240
Stand up.

110
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
Can you get up?

111
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,040
Despicable,
