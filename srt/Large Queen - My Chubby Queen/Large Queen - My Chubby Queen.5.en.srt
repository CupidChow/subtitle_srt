1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,679
It's great to have meat.

2
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,359
I want to eat all the delicious food here.

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,000
Miss,

4
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,039
but I still don't understand,

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,600
Why do we have to send the driver north?

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,920
Then I told him we were going to the south,

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,359
and now we're back in the capital.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,719
That's right.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,560
This is a cover-up I designed,

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,640
a cover-up,

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,159
Qin Molin,

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,320
I'm sure he'll find out

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,159
we left the palace soon,

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,439
At this time,

15
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,640
he won't tell anyone.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,439
I think they'll send someone like a secret guard

17
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,600
to look for us.

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,640
Me

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,560
I chose to leave the city when curfew is approaching.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,439
He left a deep impression on the guards of the city gate.

21
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,039
Then,

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,799
our captors,

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,719
We found our coachman from the north,

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,320
and we found out from the coachman's mouth,

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,560
We're heading south.

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,840
In that case, one north and one south,

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,039
half a month will pass, right?

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:01,840
Well,

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:02,640
But,

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,239
why do we have to go back to the capital early in the morning?

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,359
The most dangerous place

32
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,120
is the safest place.

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,040
Qin Molin would never have thought that

34
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,719
I would scamper under his nose.

35
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,319
My Lady,

36
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,640
you're so smart.

37
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,799
Let's go find a clothing store, shall we?

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,760
I want to buy clothes,

39
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,400
and now I smell like vegetables,

40
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,439
The clothing store,

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,640
you mean the clothing store

42
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,920
is not important.

43
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,519
Anyway, I'm going to buy a lot today,

44
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,439
go shopping crazily,

45
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,159
Let's celebrate.

46
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,879
Calm down,

47
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,159
Hey,

48
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,159
Clothing store,

49
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,760
follow me.

50
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,519
Miss,

51
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,159
what do you mean by "follow me"?

52
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,079
What did you mean?

53
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,560
There are so many good-looking clothes in your shop,

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,280
but why did you only give me this ugly one?

55
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,599
You still call me fat?

56
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,359
Cut,

57
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,799
You fat people,

58
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,239
it would be nice to have clothes to wear.

59
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,519
Me

60
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,200
That's right.

61
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,480
You're still picking and choosing,

62
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,159
-Nice. -Can you put

63
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,680
it on?

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:01:59,879
Me,

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,239
How dare you!

66
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,439
Our shop is the only place

67
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,599
in the capital that sells your fat clothes,

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
There's another one across the street,

69
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,199
but that one will close down soon.

70
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,319
He's fat, too.

71
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,520
Fight with me.

72
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,599
I don't want to know who I am.

73
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:17,560
You can just

74
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,439
do whatever you want

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,599
if you don't want to buy it or not

76
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,159
Go, go, go

77
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,400
Is this how your shop

78
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,199
treats customers?

79
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,879
The clothes in your shop

80
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,159
don't meet the needs of customers,

81
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,159
Not only do you not listen to opinions,

82
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,560
but you also laugh at customers,

83
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
Is this how you do business?

84
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
I want to give you a bad review.

85
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,800
Our shop is too small to satisfy you.

86
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,159
If you have the ability,

87
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,759
drive one yourself. You are,

88
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,439
I'll open it,

89
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,039
Miss.

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Oh,

91
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,039
What are you going to do?

92
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,120
Hum,

93
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,199
Not only will I open it,

94
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,080
but I will also open a unique ready-to-wear shop.

95
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,919
For a plump girl like me,

96
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,080
I'll open a large-size women's clothing store,

97
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,039
I'm going to fill this shop with crying,

98
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,719
sweet milk geese,

99
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,120
LU

100
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,599
I'm afraid you'll be blinded

101
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,439
by all kinds of famous brands.

102
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,120
Pearl,

103
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,599
let's go.

104
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:00,960
Hum,

105
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,240
Oh,

106
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,599
that's funny,

107
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,719
It's a famous brand.

108
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,199
My Lady,

109
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,400
are you really going to buy that clothing store?

110
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,120
Of course,

111
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,000
But,

112
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,680
After all, we escaped from the palace.

113
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,879
If you open a shop with such a big fanfare,

114
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,000
will anyone find out?

115
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,439
You don't understand.

116
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
The more you make a fuss,

117
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,919
the less likely you'll be suspected.

118
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,879
Who would have thought that

119
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,120
the empress in the palace,

120
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,199
Will you be the boss

121
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,120
of a large-size women's clothing store?

122
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,960
That's right.

123
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,960
But Miss,

124
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,919
when we buy this yard,

125
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
I've spent a lot of silver.

126
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,520
We don't have much silver left.

127
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,039
Don't worry.

128
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,400
I have my own way.

129
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,199
What is it?

130
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,120
The clothes worn by

131
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
slim women on the street,

132
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,919
The colors are bright

133
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,159
and the styles are different.

134
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,319
While the woman with a fuller figure,

135
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,400
dressed dimly,

136
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,319
Single style,

137
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,560
for all the plus-size girls,

138
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
This large-size women's clothing store of mine,

139
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,639
must be opened.

140
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,199
Ah,

141
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,279
I'll go.

142
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,079
Since ancient times,

143
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,560
the trick of touching porcelain has been exactly the same,

144
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm so hungry.

145
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm so hungry.

146
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,759
Hey,

147
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,000
Here you are.

148
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,480
What a beautiful girl.

149
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,399
This is the dream girl

150
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,879
I've been looking for.

151
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,920
You're alone,

152
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,759
but you're actually a fool.

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,680
Pearl,

154
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
let's go.

155
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,199
His appearance is extraordinary.

156
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,319
Are you here to buy a shop?

157
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,040
How much silver are you going to pay for this shop?

158
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,399
I'm going to pay

159
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
0 liang,

160
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,120
Ah,

161
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,120
You're making fun of me.
