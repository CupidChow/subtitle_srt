1
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,879
Miss,

2
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,079
Pearl

3
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,439
My Lady,

4
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,119
why are you so drunk?

5
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:34,840
Your Majesty,

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,039
Childe Qin,

7
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:36,759
let me do it.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,359
Yes.

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,320
My Lady,

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,079
why is Pearl

11
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,799
so blind?

12
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,479
Braised pork,

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,200
keep drinking.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Keep drinking.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,040
Good buddy,

16
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,719
Cheers,

17
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,799
Big drumstick.

18
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,280
Big drumstick.

19
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,239
I want to eat it even in my dreams.

20
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,959
You,

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,959
Did you miss me when you went back to the palace?

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,040
After you left,

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,719
Me,

25
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm waiting for you to come back.

26
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,840
I thought you would never miss me.

27
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,560
Do you know the result?

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,879
That Nether Leopard is Juan's brother.

29
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,519
So now I'm Juan's brother.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,959
I'm proud of myself now.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,919
Is it sweet?

32
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,599
I'll buy some more then.

34
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,520
Boss,

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,960
take a look at this account for me.

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,159
Why do I feel that nothing is right?

38
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,000
Let me see.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
This Wu Yue

40
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,759
is always around Su Jinxia.

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,680
What an eyesore!

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,240
There's nothing wrong with your account.

43
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,039
Really?

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,479
Keep counting.

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,719
I'll check the store.

46
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,360
Yes.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,800
Okay,

48
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,800
Didn't you say it's sweet?

49
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,080
I'm leaving.

50
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,520
Pearl,

51
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,319
where are my clothes?

52
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,439
You're here.

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,599
It's all ready for you.

54
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,199
Here you are

55
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,360
I'll go to the Prime Minister's Mansion

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,120
to deliver the clothes.

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,400
Take good care of Miss Shop,

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,919
Be careful not to be seen by the Prime Minister.

59
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,719
What are you afraid of?

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,439
His Majesty didn't say anything about what I did,

61
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,560
how dare he have any problem with it?

62
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,840
Let's go.

63
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,120
That's true.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
Mr. Wu.

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,039
Maybe I should call you

66
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,159
the Crown Prince of Winter Decisions.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,439
It seems that Childe Qin investigated my identity.

68
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,280
No,

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,840
I should call you the Xia Emperor.

70
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,120
When did Crown Prince of Haoyue know who I am?

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,840
When the Xia Emperor ascended the throne,

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,319
the external envoy of Winter Jue,

73
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,240
So I sent your portrait to the palace.

74
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,199
So from the very beginning,

75
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,639
you knew who I am.

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,160
Xia Huang and Boss didn't want others to know who they were,

77
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,560
so I pretended not to know.

78
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,040
I heard that Crown Prince of Haoyue likes plump people,

79
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,639
and fled because he was dissatisfied with the marriage arranged by the Winter Emperor,

80
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,399
In this respect,

81
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,959
I am the same as Boss,

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,120
They all escaped from the palace because they were dissatisfied with their marriage.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
While the two armies were at war,

84
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,600
the Crown Prince of the enemy suddenly appeared in Xiadu,

85
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,360
If I catch you and make a deal with the Winter Emperor,

86
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm sure he'll be willing to stop the war.

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
If you catch me,

88
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,000
you can stop the war.

89
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,800
I'd rather get caught.

90
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,879
It seems that Crown Prince of Bright Moon

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,600
doesn't want to fight either.

92
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,759
fight a war

93
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,120
It will only put the people of Li in dire straits.

94
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,000
How many young lives have been sacrificed

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,720
to satisfy the greed of the superior,

96
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,040
The thing I hate the most in my life is war.

97
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,360
I agree

98
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,839
with Crown Prince of Haoyue on this point.

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,639
But I can't stop Father's ambition.

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,600
I can't stop it.

101
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,399
It's because you're not powerful enough.

102
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,959
I think

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
the Winter Emperor is getting older recently,

104
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,439
If you are sick,

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,920
it is not impossible to pass the throne to the Crown Prince

106
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
to enjoy your old age.

107
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,639
You mean

108
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,839
it depends on whether Crown Prince Haoyue can be cruel

109
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,480
to the people of the two countries.

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,279
Please come in.

111
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,439
Oh,

112
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,160
Shopkeeper Su,

113
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,560
I have a stomachache.

114
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,319
Go straight ahead and turn left.

115
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,560
It's Her Ladyship's residence.

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,279
That little one is going to do something important.

117
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,720
Go ahead.

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,959
I can go by myself.

119
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,759
Go straight ahead and turn left.

120
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,759
What did you say?

121
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,879
Qin Molin

122
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,360
must be killed.

123
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,319
Someone wants to kill Qin Molin.

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,160
No way.

125
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,519
I have to get out of here first.

126
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,319
Stop!

127
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,600
It's you.

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,319
These bandits are really useless.
