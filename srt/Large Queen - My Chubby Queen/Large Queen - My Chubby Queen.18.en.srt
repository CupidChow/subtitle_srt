1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,160
Jinxia,

2
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:15,560
Strange,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,879
How could I have the guts to steal it?

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,079
How do you feel about being caught by your husband?

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,920
Don't get me wrong.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,039
Here's the thing,

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:25,320
Wu Yue,

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,079
Come here.

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,399
Okay Boss,

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,679
I want to show you today's account.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,679
Be careful

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,320
Boss, you're so powerful.

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,960
You're in such a hurry to explain.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,359
Are you afraid that he might misunderstand?

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,520
I need to talk to you in private.

16
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,319
The war in the frontier has changed,

17
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,879
so I need to go back to the palace to deal with some matters.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,519
You,

19
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,079
I don't want to go back to the palace.

20
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,120
I know you don't want to go back to the palace.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,000
I just want to say,

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,439
take good care of yourself.

23
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,719
After spending all this time together,

24
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,359
I got to know him again.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,040
After he returned to the palace,

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,239
when will he meet again

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,319
next time?

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,879
You too.

29
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,799
Take good care of yourself after you go back to the palace.

30
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,319
Don't get hurt again.

31
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,800
You're not always so lucky to have me save you.

32
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,960
Then.

33
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,639
Do you have anything else to say?

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,159
Do you want to tell me?

35
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,319
Me.

36
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,639
Me.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,719
See you.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,080
See you.

39
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,240
Don't you think it's too soon to meet again?

40
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,120
Didn't we just say goodbye yesterday?

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,840
Is there any conflict between saying goodbye yesterday and meeting today?

42
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,080
No problem.

43
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,840
His Majesty is not here.

44
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,080
Where did His Majesty go?

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,719
I, as a slave,

46
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,000
can't discuss the whereabouts of the Emperor in vain,

47
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,360
Humph.

48
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,560
Humph.

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Jinxia,

50
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,560
what do you think?

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
Not bad.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,199
Shouldn't the king of a country be very busy?

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,199
Why do you keep coming to me?

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,520
I knew you were here.

55
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,800
Qin Molin is mine,

56
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,319
no one can take it away.

57
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,000
Su Jinxia,

58
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,920
I won't let you go.
