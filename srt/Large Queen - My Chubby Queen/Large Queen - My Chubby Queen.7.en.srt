1
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,119
Pearl,

2
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,119
Yes.

3
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,000
We've sold a few dresses.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,560
My Lady,

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,159
didn't you ask just now?

6
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,840
I haven't sold one yet.

7
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,880
How many days has it been?

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,359
Why aren't there any guests?

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,799
It shouldn't be.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,840
Welcome.

11
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,840
Just you.

12
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,599
Stop,

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
Can you stop looking at me like that?

14
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,439
I'm sorry,

15
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,159
because seeing my benefactor again,

16
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
So I'm a little happy.

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,519
I, Wu Yue,

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,719
escaped from the palace and went to Xiadu,

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
I can't let Father's men find out.

20
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
I'd better use an alias.

21
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,719
You came to Xiadu to find a relative?

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,599
But my family is no longer alive.

23
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,400
The coil was stolen again.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
When I was hungry,

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
it was the benefactor's baked wheat cake.

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,400
He saved my life.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,159
I can't repay you,

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,439
but I've been studying for a few years,

29
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,400
I also managed the account for my family for a few years.

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,319
You want to stay and be the accountant for your benefactor?

31
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,000
No wages.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,199
As long as you have food and shelter.

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,639
No wages.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,639
I pick you (I announce you),

35
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,840
I pick you (I announce you)

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,439
This time, Su Jinxia went to the villa to cultivate herself,

37
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,719
which is a great plan to solve her problem.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,199
I understand.

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,039
Fake

40
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,039
Where is Su Jinxia?

41
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,759
I don't know.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
I know nothing.

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Please forgive me.

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,719
Since you don't know anything,

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
you can leave now.

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,680
Master,

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,719
there's news from the courtyard,

48
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,879
Assassins broke in.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,039
Looks like

50
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,520
they can't take it anymore.

51
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
How is the hunting going?

52
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,039
It's going as planned.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,719
That's great.

54
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,439
By the way,

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,719
how is the empress?

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
After Her Highness settled down,

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,599
she opened a large-size women's clothing store in the city.

58
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,639
Large size women's clothing store,

59
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,560
it seems to sell some strange clothes.

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,439
Interesting.

61
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,160
She is not afraid that others will find out her identity as the empress.

62
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,519
I'm looking forward to it more and more.

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
I met the empress.

64
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,839
Wipe it well now.

65
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,680
Here we go again,

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,480
Shopkeeper Chen.

67
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,319
What can I do for you?

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,079
I don't think there's anyone in your shop

69
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,560
who can make you more popular.

70
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,600
It has to be people who can make it more popular.

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,279
Hey,

72
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,480
Shopkeeper Su's mouth is so open,

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,680
Awesome,

74
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,800
But,

75
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,560
It's not enough to open a shop

76
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,079
with only one mouth.

77
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,319
Hey,

78
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,600
Why don't you

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,120
give me this plate.

80
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,639
You won't lose all your money.

81
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,759
You got it.

82
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,720
Shopkeeper Chen,

83
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,079
let's make a bet.

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,759
Let's find a model,

85
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,600
wear their own ready-made clothes and compete in this street.

86
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,279
Let's see who has the highest rate of return.

87
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,120
What rate?

88
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,680
It attracts a lot of people.

89
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,120
What if you lose?

90
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,519
Then I'll give this shop to you.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,199
He barks like a dog,

92
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,519
but,

93
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,639
If you lose,

94
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,680
please take a detour when you see me again.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
Don't dirty my eyes.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,959
Okay,

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
It's a deal.

98
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,279
The match will be held in five days.
