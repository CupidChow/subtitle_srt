1
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,320
I still owe the empress a wedding night,

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:15,919
why don't I,

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,160
Make it up tonight.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,480
No!

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm a modern soul after all.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,600
You can even be teased by an ancient man.

7
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,440
No, no, no.

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,120
You have to come back to flirt with me.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,960
Since His Majesty wants me to sleep with him,

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,840
I can only do as I say.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,600
What are you doing

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,119
as a bed attendant?

13
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,079
Your Majesty,

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,759
let me help you change your clothes.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,359
It suddenly occurred to me that

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,759
the memorial hasn't been approved yet,

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,039
Your Highness, go to bed early.

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,880
Your Majesty, I'm waiting for you.

19
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,959
Qin Molin, you two-faced man,

20
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,760
Hum,

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,519
I finally caught him.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,200
But he's just

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,159
an innocent boy in his early twenties,

24
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,000
Master,

25
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,359
the assassin of the empress is a soldier of death.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,640
He committed suicide by taking poison.

27
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,159
I found a snake tattoo

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,359
on his hand,

29
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,879
It's them.

30
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,000
Since it's them,

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,599
don't alert them.

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,079
Yes, Your Highness.

33
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,280
Lin'er

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,920
Since I want to eat osmanthus cake,

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,359
every year, the chrysanthemum blossoms bloom,

36
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,959
Your grandmother would fill her skirt with osmanthus flowers,

37
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,040
go home and make osmanthus cakes,

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,719
You want to kill me?

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,439
How dare you!

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,879
How dare you offend Consort Hui?

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,599
Consort Hui atoned for her sins

42
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,560
Mo Lin was just anxious to send her osmanthus cake,

43
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,519
I didn't mean to offend Her Highness,

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,879
isn't this Gui Yu's son?

45
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,120
You thought you could climb the dragon bed by stepping on me

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,560
and become a phoenix on the branch?

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,800
A pheasant is a pheasant,

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,439
forever.

49
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,759
I can't become a phoenix.

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,960
Osmanthus cake,

51
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,960
she deserves it too.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,080
Humph.

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,240
I only have this mung bean cake.

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,319
Here you are.

55
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,400
Take it.

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,319
Don't cry.

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,879
My father said,

58
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,599
Men don't shed tears easily,

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
especially

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,000
in front of those who bully them.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,960
I have to fight back,

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,919
but I'm too weak.

63
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,199
I can't resist,

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,879
my father said,

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,360
If there is a disparity in strength between the two armies,

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,520
we must,

67
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,039
Well,

68
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,759
Have a good meal.

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,879
Keep your spirits up,

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,680
and when the enemy isn't looking,

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,039
Down with the enemy!

72
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,240
That's it.

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,199
My father taught me that.

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,800
How does your father know everything?

75
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,680
Of course.

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,919
My father is amazing.

77
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,199
My name is Su Jinxia,

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,280
and you?

79
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,080
My name is

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
Qin Molin,

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,080
Su Jinxia,

82
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,759
after I saved you twice,

83
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,680
It's kind of a return to you.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,240
It's really humbling to be a empress.

85
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
I don't even have enough to eat,

86
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,120
but the punishment for refusing to eat meat has passed.

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,199
There's still no meat foam

88
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,120
at dinner today.

89
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,800
The madam in charge said that Her Highness needs to lose weight,

90
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,599
so she specially asked the kitchen

91
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,960
to make some light vegetables for Her Highness,

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,479
I'm the empress.

93
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,560
Under one person,

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,599
above ten thousand people.

95
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,960
Why do you want to lose weight?

96
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,479
Your Highness,

97
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,560
in Xiadu,

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,080
women who are fat are considered cheap.

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
You used to be in the General's Mansion,

100
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,520
and the General doted on Her Highness.

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,199
Of course I won't use these rules

102
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,240
to restrict Her Highness.

103
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,719
But now,

104
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,959
we are in the palace,

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,639
I can't help it.

106
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,519
All the officials said that the empress of Xiadu

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,160
can't be a fat person.

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,160
That's why Madam in charge tried her best

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
to make Her Highness lose weight.

110
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,720
What kind of rule?

111
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,480
It's not why the late emperor

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
hated fat women so much.

113
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,439
It seems to have something to do with the experience of the late emperor when he was young.

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
As for the specific reason,

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm not sure.

116
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,920
No matter what the reason is,

117
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
we shouldn't implicate anyone else.

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
The other fat women didn't do anything wrong.

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,959
This is discrimination.

120
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,879
If I don't want to be the empress,

121
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,519
who wants to be the empress?

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,680
And you dislike me.

123
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,439
I don't think so.

124
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,759
You were assassinated again,

125
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,879
and you didn't have enough to eat,

126
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,920
There are a lot of rules every day.

127
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,639
Looks like the escape plan is going to be advanced.

128
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:05,720
I've made up my mind.

129
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,519
Your Highness, what have you decided?

130
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,120
I've decided

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,879
to escape from the palace,

132
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,920
We're here now,

133
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,120
and then we're going to this place,

134
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,360
We're going through here.

135
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:17,720
Here,

136
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,399
so if

137
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,720
we go from here to here,

138
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,439
It's easy to find out.

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,319
So we can only go from here to here.

140
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,959
Then go around this place again,

141
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,040
don't let anyone suspect you,

142
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,959
And then I came here.

143
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,720
Got it?

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,519
Oh,

145
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,519
it doesn't matter if you don't understand,

146
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,720
You just need to follow me.

147
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,600
The first step of our plan to escape from the palace,

148
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,120
is to bring

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,399
all the gold, silver and jewelry that are easy to carry,

150
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:37,839
The second step,

151
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,959
I've inquired about it.

152
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:40,959
Every afternoon,

153
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,879
vegetable vendors deliver vegetables to the palace,

154
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,800
At that time,

155
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,879
the guards in the palace were not so strict,

156
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,480
Because they need to change jobs.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,839
Before they leave,

158
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,199
we have to get into their big vegetable basket.

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,360
Escape from the palace

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,480
and fly freely from now on.

161
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,079
Let's go.

162
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Fly freely,

163
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,839
we are free,

164
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,560
Shh.

165
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,439
Your Highness,

166
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,680
we really escaped from the palace.

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,879
Now that you've escaped from the palace,

168
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,920
don't call me Your Highness anymore.

169
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,839
Call me Jinxia.

170
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,839
That won't work.

171
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,399
How about I call you Miss,

172
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,639
