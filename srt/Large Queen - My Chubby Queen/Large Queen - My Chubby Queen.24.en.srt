1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,480
Qin Molin,

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,640
why don't you wake up?

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,679
If anything happens to you,

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,880
Ever since I came here,

6
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,640
you've been saving me.

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,840
Although at the beginning,

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
you must have other intentions.

9
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,320
However,

10
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,679
in the later days,

11
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,159
I saw your true heart.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,200
Can you help me find Juan?

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,640
Catch Chen Jie,

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,200
you've been protecting me subconsciously,

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,399
He even did a lot of things

16
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,679
for me behind my back.

17
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,799
Qin Molin,

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,359
wake up, okay?

19
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,079
I really can't live without you.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,239
Stop crying.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,959
I will feel distressed.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,239
Are you pretending to be dizzy?

23
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,439
I just want to know

24
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,959
what's on your mind.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,599
Qin Molin,

26
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,920
go to hell!

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,920
You scared me.

28
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,640
You scared me.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,159
It seems that I don't have a chance at all.

30
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,080
Are you okay?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,919
How's your strength?

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,280
Not bad, right?

33
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,199
I did so well,

34
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,039
can you stop being angry with me?

35
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,120
I'll think about it.

36
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,319
Su,

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,759
Su

38
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,319
What the heck?

39
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,400
Su,

40
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,520
I like you.

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
Would you like to go back to the palace with me

42
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,560
and be my empress?

43
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,319
This is too straight.

44
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't look at me like that.

45
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,680
I can't take it anymore.

46
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,639
Su

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,919
Su Jinxia, what are you doing?

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,919
As a woman of the new era,

49
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,520
it's unreasonable for you to be so coy.

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,879
Gosh,

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
Actually,

52
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,480
Actually, I like you too.

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,439
But I don't want to go back to the palace with you to be the empress.

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Why?

55
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,759
Are you afraid that

56
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,480
after you return to the palace,

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,959
There will be no freedom.

58
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,000
The empress is really not a human being,

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,240
not only do you not have enough to eat,

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,839
And there are many rules,

61
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,079
not to mention,

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,439
Your Majesty, your harem is so beautiful,

63
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,800
I don't want to share a husband with others.

64
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,399
Three thousand weak water,

65
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,600
I'll only take one ladle.

66
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,079
It's not a problem.

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,639
I promise you.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,480
After I return to the palace,

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I will issue an imperial edict,

70
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
You're the only one in the harem.

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,680
If you never accept a consort,

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,639
I won't restrict your freedom.

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,079
I won't let you be burdened by the imperial rules.

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,279
Besides,

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,959
didn't you say,

76
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,079
The original intention of opening a large-size women's clothing store,

77
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,800
is to help people like Juan.

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,279
If you become the empress,

79
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,199
you can do more than that.

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
Su,

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,959
are you willing to

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,959
change this country with me?

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Verbal statements

84
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,519
have no evidence. We have to prove it with written evidence.

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,279
First,

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,680
you must always like Su Jinxia alone,

87
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,399
Don't change your mind,

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,720
or the scissors will serve you.

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,759
Second,

90
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,839
let Su Jinxia eat well,

91
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,480
Drink well

92
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,439
and you'll be free.

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
Third,

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
quarrel with Su Jinxia,

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,319
You must admit your mistake.

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,600
What if you're wrong?

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
Su Jinxia is always right.

98
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,160
Add this too.

99
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
Okay, okay.

100
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,040
For the late wedding night,

101
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,600
you have to make it up to me.

102
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,720
When you put on my princess dress,

103
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,800
you will be very beautiful,

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,839
which means beautiful.

105
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,680
Director Zhu,

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
Hey,

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
There's a new style.

108
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,759
The new goods from the group headquarters have arrived.

109
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,160
Your Majesty.

110
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,920
Armistice agreement?
