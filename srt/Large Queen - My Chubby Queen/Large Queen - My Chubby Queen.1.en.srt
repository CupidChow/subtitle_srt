1
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,640
To put it nicely, it's the empress.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,199
To put it bluntly,

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,919
Actually, I'm here to congratulate the emperor.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Shh.

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:17,280
Lower your voice.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,839
Do you want your life or not?

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,120
So what?

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,960
She's just a fat woman,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,120
in the Xiadu dynasty,

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,519
Fatty's identity is the lowest.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,440
If she was born in a commoner's home,

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,359
she would be inferior to us.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,079
I heard that she also suffers from heart disease.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,880
If it weren't for the State Preceptor saying that she has a strong character,

15
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,920
she is also the daughter of General Su You'an.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,479
She can be

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,880
the empress. Stop it.

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,320
The General-in-Chief's four sons all died in battle,

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,520
but now there's only one daughter left.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,439
For the sake of General-in-Chief,

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,439
His Majesty won't mistreat Her Highness.

22
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,280
Your Highness,

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:48,880
bad news.

24
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,640
Your Highness,

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,079
Your Majesty,

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,719
His Majesty passed away.

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,280
What?

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
All the officials said Her Highness died

29
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,799
and His Majesty

30
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,840
wanted Her Highness

31
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,239
to be buried.

32
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,200
Your Highness,

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,040
wake up, Your Highness.

34
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,879
Your Highness, what's wrong?

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Don't scare Pearl!

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,799
Your Highness,

37
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,159
wake up, Your Highness.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,239
Your Highness, what's wrong?

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,680
Don't scare Pearl!

40
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Your Highness, what's wrong?

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Your Highness,

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Your Highness,

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,760
Don't scare Pearl!

44
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,079
What's wrong with her?

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,799
Are you okay?

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,280
Your Highness,

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,680
you're awake.

48
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,359
That's great, Your Highness.

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
How dare you steal my clothing design?

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,519
You can eat without food,

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,760
Don't talk nonsense.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,680
Do you have any proof?

53
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,480
Hum,

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,319
You.

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,599
Am I hallucinating?

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
Why is there a girl in ancient costume?

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,680
Look at me crying.

58
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,520
You scared me to death just now.

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,680
You're finally awake.

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,639
I got into a fight with that witch,

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,199
and accidentally hit my head.

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,280
And then I came here.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,639
So I

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
might,

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Maybe,

66
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,840
maybe

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,080
it's time travel.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,520
Ah.

69
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Your Highness.

70
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,919
My QQ face is so cute.

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,520
Good Q-bomb.

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,280
It's quite strong.

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,159
I only have this mung bean cake.

74
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,879
Here you are.

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,319
Take it. Don't cry.

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
My name is Su Jinxia,

77
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:17,479
and you?

78
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,080
What are these pictures?

79
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,560
It seems to be the memory of the original owner.

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,439
In ancient times, Su Jinxia,

81
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,840
rest in peace.

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,560
Since I've taken over your identity,

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
I'll live a good life for you.

84
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,400
Your Highness,

85
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,360
are you all right?

86
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,439
If people find out that I'm not the original owner,

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,639
I came from modern times.

88
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,439
He'll surely burn me as a monster.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,680
Nothing.

90
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,159
Pearl,

91
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,159
Yes.

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
You just said that

93
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,400
the emperor passed away,

94
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,479
All the officials want me to be buried,

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes

96
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,479
What Pearl heard from the eunuchs of the previous dynasty,

97
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,520
isn't it for what reason?

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,039
The old emperor is not in good health and has hiccups.

99
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,280
Why should you blame me?

100
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,159
He was buried dead,

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:03,840
buried dead,

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,039
It's the ugliest phenomenon in your ancient times.

103
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,759
Extinction of humanity.

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,759
It should be abolished.

105
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,759
What did I tell you before?

106
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,400
A fat man wants to be the empress?

107
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
The Su family is really going to be the last of its kind this time.

108
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,319
Shut up.

109
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,079
What are you afraid of?

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
She's going to die anyway.

111
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,079
Do you think I'm the cowardly

112
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,839
Su Jinxia

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
who didn't dare to do anything to you?

114
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,360
Even if I'm dead, I'm still the empress.

115
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,839
What are you?

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,879
My brother,

117
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,759
who died on the battlefield in order to protect our country,

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,639
you guys

119
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,519
You deserve to talk about him.

120
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,240
Forgive me, Your Highness.

121
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,279
Forgive me, Your Highness.

122
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,000
Forgive me, Your Highness.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,680
Get out of the way!

124
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,600
Please stay, Your Highness.

125
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,839
Your Highness,

126
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,800
please follow the late emperor and move to Xia Xiaoling Mausoleum.

127
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,079
Su Jinxia,

128
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,519
you killed His Majesty.

129
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,600
Don't wait for the burial.

130
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
Where do you want to go?

131
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,759
I will defeat His Majesty.

132
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,000
While my father was fighting outside,

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,839
you urged the late emperor to marry me for joy,

134
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,519
According to what you said,

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,120
the murderer who killed the late emperor,

136
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,439
It should be you.

137
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:25,920
You,

138
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,199
You argue irrationally,

139
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,160
argue irrationally,

140
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,120
You're no better than your boss, Prime Minister Ma.

141
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,639
First, you encouraged the late emperor to marry me,

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,519
and the late emperor died,

143
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,079
You hurt me again.

144
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
Wolf ambition,

145
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,800
what exactly is your purpose?

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,319
You,

147
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,120
Smelly old man,

148
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,040
ugly and black-hearted,

149
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,399
It's so bad.

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,759
You want me to be buried.

151
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,079
Don't even think about it.

152
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,839
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

153
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,639
Help!

154
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
Take her down!

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,639
Stop!

156
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,199
His Majesty is here.

157
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,040
Your Majesty.

158
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,000
Your Majesty.

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Wow,

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,839
So handsome.

161
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,399
Greetings, Your Majesty.

162
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,920
This is how the handsome male lead

163
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,600
in the dog-blood drama comes out.

164
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,360
He's so handsome that I can't extricate myself.

165
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,199
Su Jinxia,

166
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,240
kneel down when you see the new emperor,

167
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,000
Old man,

168
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm the late emperor's empress.

169
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,920
What's wrong with the new emperor?

170
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,519
I'm still his stepmother?

171
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,360
It's okay if you don't want to be buried

172
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,079
Really?

173
