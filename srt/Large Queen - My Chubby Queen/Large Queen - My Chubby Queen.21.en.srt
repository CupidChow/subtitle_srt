1
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,240
Cheers,

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:13,960
Cheers!

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,559
Last time,

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,039
you left a letter and left.

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,359
I didn't expect the meeting to be like this again.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,559
Last time, when I sneaked out of the race,

7
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,160
my brother's men found me

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,719
and took me back.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,559
I begged him for a long time,

10
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,239
so he asked me to send you a letter.

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,159
I'm afraid everyone will worry about me,

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,520
so I'm really sorry to leave without saying goodbye.

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,920
Are you Miss Su?

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,000
My sister always talks about you,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,079
oh no

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,799
This is the flood of water rushing into the Dragon King Temple.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,479
I was wrong. I was wrong.

18
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,240
Brother Ming Bao,

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,840
you don't have to blame yourself.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,320
I'm fine now, aren't I?

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,399
But can you tell me,

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,920
who is trying to kill me?

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,920
I really don't know.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,640
But don't worry,

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,079
I've already said it.

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,079
You, Miss Su,

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,519
are the one to be covered by my Nether Leopard.

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
I'm sure the world will give me some respect.

29
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,519
Thank you, Brother Mingbao.

30
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,040
It's not a big deal.

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,280
By the way,

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,120
It's getting late.

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,959
I'll go back first.

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,159
No,

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,959
keep drinking.

36
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,680
I haven't finished yet.

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
Yes, Miss Su.

38
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,920
It's getting late.

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,040
You'd better stay here

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
and leave tomorrow.

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,719
Let's have a good drink today.

42
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,200
All right.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,480
Cheers!

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,120
Come on,

45
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:33,719
Cheers,

46
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,079
Cheers,

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,480
Cheers!

48
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,200
Cheers!

49
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,079
Drink,

50
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,079
Master,

51
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,599
Her Highness was kidnapped by the Nether Leopard of Yifeng Village,

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,760
The Ghost Leopard of Yifeng Village

53
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,719
is the leader of the bandits

54
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,560
on Yifeng Mountain.

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,120
Yes.

56
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,799
So strong.

57
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,040
What about the boss?

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,920
Miss Su,

59
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,640
all my life, Ming Dabao,

60
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,960
My sister is the one

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,400
who worries the most,

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,759
Juanjuan,

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,120
growing up,

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,639
Because she's fat,

65
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,439
you mean her,

66
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,000
She's not...

67
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,080
She's not confident,

68
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,719
It's a sin.

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
I don't know why she's so fat.

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,479
What's wrong with being fat?

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,039
I told her,

72
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
"Chubby is fine

73
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,639
and suitable to be a thief with me. ",

74
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,039
He can hold people back,

75
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,639
Yes.

76
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,520
Oh,

77
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,280
it's still useless.

78
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,039
No matter what I say, it's useless.

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
Stop crying.

80
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,319
Look how good it is now.

81
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,719
You're happy again.

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
And happy.

83
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,800
You can eat it again.

84
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,159
I know.

85
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
This is your credit.

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,360
It's all because of you.

87
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

88
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,759
Don't be ridiculous.

89
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,039
Exactly

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,759
You're my benefactor!

91
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,520
Great benefactor,

92
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,840
benefactor,

93
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
I don't even know how to thank you.

94
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,000
You're

95
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,400
a second-born parent,

96
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,080
Mom,

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,039
Mom,

98
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,080
Mom,

99
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,719
No,

100
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,199
Mom,

101
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
My mom.

102
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,280
It turns out that the Dark Leopard is the Empress'godson, which

103
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,400
is a false alarm.

104
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,560
Her Highness shouldn't be in danger.

105
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,800
What?

106
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,319
Reborn parents?

107
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,960
You call me old.

108
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,919
Well,

109
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,240
Brother,

110
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,879
It can

111
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,039
regenerate my brother,

112
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,560
Right?

113
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,120
Little brother,

114
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,639
big brother,

115
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,240
Little brother,

116
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,800
big brother,

117
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Little brother,

118
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,280
big brother,

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Brother,

120
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,719
don't cry.

121
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,080
Be good,

122
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,599
Brother is here,

123
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,960
brother is here,

124
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,919
I'll take care of you.

125
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,280
I'll take care of you.

126
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,759
Come on,

127
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Keep doing it,

128
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,680
bro. Give me a hug,

129
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,000
Tell us what's on our mind,

130
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,639
tell us,
