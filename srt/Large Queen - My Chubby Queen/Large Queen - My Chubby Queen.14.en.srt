1
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,000
What time is it now?

2
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:14,800
Ah,

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,719
Some people are afraid of losing,

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,559
so they dare not come.

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,719
Am I right?

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,120
Are you scared?

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,600
Who said we didn't dare to come?

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,039
Who is this?

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,759
Who is this?

10
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,640
What are you doing?

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,920
Dressed like this,

12
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,320
dressed like this,

13
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,679
It's immoral.

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,679
Does it look good?

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,920
I think it's pretty good.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,719
It's a game you can't win.

17
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,359
Do you have to come?

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,319
I was thinking,

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,159
Shopkeeper Chen,

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,040
If I don't scold you every day,

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,200
you'll feel uncomfortable.

22
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,359
If you lose the game,

23
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,840
you can't be scolded by me anymore.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm not used to it,

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
You,

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,799
It's okay.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,439
What about today?

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,799
I'd like to give you a few words as a gift.

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,079
I'll make you happy.

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,599
Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!

31
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,599
Beep! You dare to bully Juan.

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,480
Sooner or later,

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,640
you have to be beeping.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:25,879
Gosh,

35
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,319
I'll go.

36
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,640
The rules of today's competition are very simple,

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
two models show their clothes

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,959
on the stage respectively,

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,599
The winner is decided by the applause

40
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,719
and screams of the audience.

41
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,680
Now,

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,959
let's start the competition.

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,599
Okay,

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

45
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,240
Okay,

46
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,199
Okay,

47
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,960
It looks good.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay,

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Nice.

50
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,840
It looks good.

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,039
Okay,

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
Okay,

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,719
They're going to win.

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,719
Shopkeeper Chen,

55
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,840
is there any need to compete in this situation?

56
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,560
You fat people are cheap people

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,319
who wear beautiful clothes,

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,680
Unseemly,

59
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,840
Let's go.

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,919
When I first met Juan,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
she was being bullied by two bad guys.

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,280
She didn't dare to resist.

63
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,719
There was no other reason.

64
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,159
Because she's fat.

65
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,360
She didn't do anything wrong.

66
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,240
On the contrary,

67
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
she is a kind and beautiful girl.

68
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,599
Then why are you being treated unfairly

69
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,319
because you're fat?

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,839
Just because of that weird rule?

71
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,920
All men are created equal.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,519
Whether we are fat or thin,

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,720
we all have the right to pursue good things.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,000
All of us should stand up bravely

75
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,920
and advocate the concept of equality,

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,240
Well said,

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,600
well said,

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,120
Well said,

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,639
Okay,

80
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,800
Well said.

81
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,040
Well said,

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,839
Okay,

83
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,920
I should learn from her.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,480
People,

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,720
All men are created equal,

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,240
Okay,

87
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:47,639
Okay,

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,480
Okay,

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,399
That's how it should be.

90
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,399
Su Jinxia,
