1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,839
When Rou Yi saw the emperor's brother,

2
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,239
she was injured by the empress.

3
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,440
It really hurts.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,920
A tonic soup specially made for the emperor's brother.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,000
Brother Emperor, drink it while it's hot.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,199
Leave it there.

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,840
I'll drink it later.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,479
Rouyi is a little dizzy

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,679
and can't stand still,

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,280
Brother Emperor, can you give me a hand?

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,879
You must have caught a cold.

12
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,120
Wear more clothes.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,159
Lu Zhong,

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,359
go back and rest early.

15
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,480
You're still here.

16
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,319
Pearl,

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,599
how many days have it been?

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,599
Your Highness,

19
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,439
it's only the third day

20
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:39,920
Ah,

21
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,400
What is it?

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,280
It feels like

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,519
a year has passed.

24
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm a man of no meat and no joy.

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
So annoying.

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Qin Molin, you jerk. Greetings,

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,439
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
Find a chance,

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
Yes.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
I want to eat meat.

31
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,319
I want to eat meat.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,280
Pig's trotters.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,240
Pig's trotters.

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,879
What's that sound?

35
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,360
It sounds like

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
the voice of the empress,

37
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,439
I haven't seen Her Highness for many days,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800
so let's go and have a look today.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,479
Yes.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,159
I finally know

41
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,759
what it's like to be hungry and hallucinate.

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,319
Ah.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Yeyi,

44
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,840
take him down.

45
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,719
There's an assassin.

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,199
Su Jinxia,

47
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,759
with a knife on the head of the color character,

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,919
You can't be fooled by men.

49
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,520
Have you seen enough?

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
Have you had enough hugs?

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,400
If I hug my own empress,

52
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,719
why can't I?

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Your Majesty,

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,159
aren't you afraid that someone will be jealous?

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,520
Who is he?

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,759
Someone … Of course, he is your favorite.

57
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh no.

58
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,719
You told His Majesty's secret like this.

59
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,319
My life is over.

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,520
How come I didn't know I had a boyfriend

61
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,560
and how did the Empress know that?

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,240
Well

63
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,520
If the empress doesn't say anything,

64
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,800
the punishment of not eating meat,

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,879
Why don't we postpone it for a few more days?

66
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,680
No, no!

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,399
I'll tell you,

68
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,240
I'll tell you,

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,079
Rumor has it that

70
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,680
Your Majesty, you're not close to women,

71
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,639
It's because of Dragon-Yang Addiction,

72
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,600
but

73
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,199
I don't think Longyang fetishism is a big deal.

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
It's just because the person you like,

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
happens to be of the same sex as you.

76
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
This kind of love is also very respectable.

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,439
Do I have a dragon-yang fetish?

78
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,720
Your Highness, you'll know when you try.

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,439
How?

80
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,120
What do you think?

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,279
Su Jinxia,

82
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,360
how could you ask such a stupid question?

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,040
Don't mess around.

84
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,120
Me,

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,600
Me,

86
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
If you keep doing this, I'll scream.

87
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,639
I still owe the empress a wedding night,

88
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,959
why don't I,

89
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,199
Make it up tonight.

90
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
No!
