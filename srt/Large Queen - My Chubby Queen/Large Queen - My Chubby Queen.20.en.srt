1
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,960
Miss, you haven't come back yet

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,839
to deliver a dress.

3
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,039
I'll go out and look for it.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,879
Me too.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,359
Yes

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,840
In what?

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,520
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,479
What

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,320
does it say?

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,520
There you are.

11
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,840
You're so scared that you wake up.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,519
Sir,

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,519
we had no grudges in the past,

14
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,760
I don't have any grudges recently,

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,239
why did you arrest me?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,680
Why

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,719
did I arrest you?

18
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,040
Someone wants you dead.

19
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,200
We're just

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,159
doing things with money,

21
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
If someone wants to kill me,

22
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,400
who would want to kill me?

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,359
Someone is trying to kill me in the palace.

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,879
I managed to escape from the palace,

25
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,200
but someone tried to kill me.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,799
My life is too bitter.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,599
Originally,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,920
we were going to

29
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,879
let you die right away.

30
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,200
Later, when we thought about it,

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
you should live a little longer.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,239
We can make one more stroke.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,719
I'll let you live for an extra hour.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
Sir,

35
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,680
look at your big body,

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,959
You look so upright.

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,760
I think you must be the kind of chivalrous man

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,400
who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,719
How about this?

40
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,319
Isn't it just money?

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,280
It's easy to discuss.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,159
How much do you want?

43
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,280
As long as you let me go,

44
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,400
we can discuss it.

45
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,919
I'll let you go.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
You already know us.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,319
I'll let you go.

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,759
Think of me as a fool.

49
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,319
Ah,

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
What are you thinking?

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,879
Play mind games with me again.

52
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,680
I can take care of you

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,759
for two hours with one knife,

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,039
The ransom hasn't come yet.

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
I'll send you home.

56
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,759
It's time now.

57
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,120
Why didn't anyone send you money?

58
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,360
Oh,

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,759
it's time to send you on your way.

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,039
Hold on.

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,719
Hero,

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
think about it again.

63
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,000
How much did the person who wanted to kill me pay you?

64
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,159
I'll give you double.

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,599
You did it for money, didn't you?

66
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,120
Double?

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,719
Yes.

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,439
What you think is pretty.

69
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,400
And double it.

70
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,639
We have rules in this business,

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,199
Whose money did you take first?

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
You have to do your job well.

73
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,919
What are you calling this?

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
This is called eating two heads?

75
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,479
You broke the rules.

76
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,479
No, no.

77
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm still very famous in the world.

78
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,919
I still want to hang out.

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
But

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,240
don't worry,

81
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,039
I'm a professional.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,000
I promise it won't hurt.

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Come on,

84
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,519
now

85
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,399
I'll send you on your way.

86
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,759
Ming Dabao,

87
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,639
stop!

88
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,279
Juan,
