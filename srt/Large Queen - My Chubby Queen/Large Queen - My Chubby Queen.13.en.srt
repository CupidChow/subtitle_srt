Master,

00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,719
Ye Yi,

00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,640
Find Juan's whereabouts.

00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,239
Yes.

Juan,

7
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:29,679
excuse me,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,359
Have you ever seen a woman?

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,320
Your body shape is like this?

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,799
No.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,640
Juan,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,799
Juan,

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,159
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,240
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,640
You've never seen

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,039
a woman of your body shape,

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:41,560
I haven't seen

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,359
Juan before,

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,439
Juan,

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,159
Juan,

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,200
Juan,

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,560
Juan,

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,079
Juan,

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,200
Juan,

25
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,920
Juan,

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,920
Juan,

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,719
Juan,

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,359
Juan,

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,200
Juan,

30
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,880
are you here?

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,239
Juan,

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,000
Juan.

33
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,280
Why hasn't it started yet?

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,439
Start now.

35
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:18,879
Juan,

36
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,000
Juan,

37
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,280
Juan,

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,840
Jinxia,

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,480
Come with me.

40
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,120
Lift your feet.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,640
stay temporarily

42
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,879
Lift your feet.

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,879
stay temporarily

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,159
Lift your feet.

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,319
Stay,

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,079
Oh,

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,040
Who is this?

48
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,760
Hahahaha.

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,560
Gosh.

50
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Isn't this a model from a plus-size women's clothing store?

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh,

52
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,120
I wonder what your shopkeeper

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,840
is thinking?

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
If I choose you as my model,

55
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,759
what are you doing?

56
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,680
What can I do?

57
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
I can touch you.

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,039
No matter

59
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,000
what clothes you wear, it's wrong.

60
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,960
It's just a joke.

61
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,919
You know that, right?

62
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,960
I'll tell your shopkeeper later

63
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,240
that she's going to lose.

64
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,280
Tell her to bark like a dog.

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,560
Hahahaha.

66
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm going to win.

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,479
Woof woof,

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,919
you're chest-high,

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,639
Come on,

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,759
let's go this way,

71
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,560
Right?

72
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,280
Ouch.

73
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,599
Juan,

74
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,400
Miss Su,

75
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,159
Why are you here?

76
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,680
You know we're all worried about you.

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry

78
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,039
for making you worry.

79
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,479
I just...

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,960
I just.

81
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want to take part in the competition.

82
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,479
I'll get you into trouble.

83
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,240
What are you talking about?

84
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,840
Shopkeeper Chen said,

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
Shopkeeper Chen said,

86
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,560
He said,

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
a fat man like me,

88
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,240
It will only make others feel sick.

89
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm going to take part in the competition.

90
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,919
I'm sure I'll lose.

91
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,840
Bullshit!

92
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,960
No, don't listen to that old man who shakes his head.

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,599
Come on,

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,360
Follow me.

95
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,639
Come with me.

96
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,639
Trust me.

97
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,439
Let's go.

98
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go.

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
Trust me,

100
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,240
Let's go.

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,759
Look,

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
Juan is so beautiful.

103
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,039
She's kind and lovely

104
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,360
and considerate of others,

105
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,599
For the sake of other people's business,

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,280
I tried my best to train what I'm not good at.

107
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,599
But he didn't complain at all.

108
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,759
Juan,

109
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,000
whether you're thin or fat,

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,439
Each of us is the most beautiful of us.

111
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,000
We don't have to.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,439
Because of other people's words,

113
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,120
you deny yourself.

114
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,240
Don't cry.

115
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
I had a hard time putting on my makeup,

116
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,560
Come on,

117
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,680
Let me show you.

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,639
The clothes I just made.

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,399
Why hasn't he come yet?

120
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,439
Are you really scared?

121
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,759
What time is it now?

122
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,639
Some people are afraid of losing,

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,399
so they dare not come.

124
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,639
Am I right?

125
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
Probably,

126
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,560
who said we didn't dare to come?
