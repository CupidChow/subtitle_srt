1
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,279
Raise your head

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,039
and hold your chest high.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,160
Put in your belly

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,120
and lift your butt?

5
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,800
Lift your feet.

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,640
stay temporarily

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,280
It should fall on the heel,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,800
a little forward.

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,120
We have to walk like cats.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,280
Like a cat,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,640
look up,

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,000
Chest out.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,679
Raise your head

14
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,240
and hold your chest high.

15
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,439
Put in your belly

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,759
and lift your butt?

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,560
stay temporarily

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,560
It landed a little forward on the heel.

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,079
I think this is too difficult.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,479
It's okay, Juan.

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,240
I think you did a good job.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,560
You need to relax.

23
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,000
Inhale and exhale,

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,759
why does she have so many

25
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,200
strange ideas,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,120
I have no idea at all.

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,640
What should I wear?

28
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,439
Raise your head

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,239
and hold your chest high.

30
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:32,920
Put in your belly

31
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,000
and lift your butt?

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,000
Stand still.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,640
Stand still.

34
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,120
We must persist.

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,599
Perseverance is victory.

36
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,480
It's still not right.

37
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,079
I got it.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,599
That's not bad.

39
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,120
Come on, Juan.

40
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,319
Come on!

41
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,120
Come on!

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,039
Come on, Juan.

43
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,400
Come on, Juan.

44
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,039
Come on, Juan.

45
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,719
Come on, Juan.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,919
Come on, Juan.

47
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,120
Come on, Juan.

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,120
Come on!

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,400
Come on, Juan.

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
Juan, you did it.

51
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,879
Come on, Juan! Come on!

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Come on, Juan.

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,400
Come on, Juan.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,360
That's great.

55
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,719
I finally made it.

56
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,919
That's great.

57
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,479
That's great, Juan.

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
You did it.

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
That's great.

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,639
Today is the day to win or lose.

61
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,240
My lady,

62
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,599
bad news.

63
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,039
My lady, bad news.

64
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,919
Juan is missing.

65
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,360
What did you say?

66
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,199
Juan is gone.

67
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,800
I couldn't find her anywhere.

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
The game is about to begin.

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,240
What should we do?

70
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,439
Don't tell me something happened.

71
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,719
Let's split up and look for it.

72
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,280
Yes.

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,879
Let's go.
