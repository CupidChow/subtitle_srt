1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,279
Little girl,

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,800
how much money are you going to use to buy this shop?

3
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,079
I'm going to pay

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:23,920
0 liang,

5
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:24,960
Ah,

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,000
You're making fun of me.

7
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,120
Leave if you don't buy it.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,480
Don't disturb my sleep.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
Madam, don't worry.

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,479
Don't you think,

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,600
people are divided into three, six, nine, etc., because of their body shape,

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,560
Isn't it fair?

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:36,880
Your clothes,

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
in terms of quality and style,

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,960
It's better than the other side.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,000
But for some inexplicable reason,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,759
I lost to the other side,

18
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,280
Are you really willing to accept it?

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:50,920
Trust me.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,799
Big size women's clothing store,

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,799
as its name implies,

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,439
It's just selling clothes

23
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,840
for plump girls like us,

24
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,960
Well said.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,599
But as a businessman,

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,680
I don't do unprofitable things.

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,280
Don't worry,

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Madam.

29
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,519
How can working with me make you lose money?

30
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,280
Tell me about it.

31
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,760
Pearl,

32
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:20,920
One,

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,319
Introduction of main products of large size,

34
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,239
Two,

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,719
Marketing situation and marketing strategy,

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,319
Three,

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,079
Investment funds and their uses.

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:43,640
Well,

39
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,879
in a word,

40
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,680
The construction of our large-size women's clothing program

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,319
will promote the industrial structure

42
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,439
of women's clothing in Xiadu,

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,359
Organizational structure,

44
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,239
technical structure,

45
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,200
The adjustment and optimization of product structure

46
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,640
has a positive role in promoting.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,599
The landlady

48
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,040
has great potential.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,480
What about me?

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,159
With technology,

51
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,280
you use your store and raw materials

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,079
to invest in shares,

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,239
Let's split it.

54
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,039
I promise.

55
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,680
I'll make you at least 220 yuan a month.

56
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Ah,

57
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,159
220,

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,960
are you so confident?

59
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,919
Of course,

60
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,560
if the turnover is not reached,

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
I'll pay you double.

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,400
Double?

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Okay,

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,680
I'll buy shares.

66
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,479
What is it?

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,360
Your Majesty,

68
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,680
Her Highness'maid came to report,

69
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,960
Her Highness is missing?

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,639
I have secretly asked people to look for it in the palace,

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,439
but there is no trace of Her Highness.

72
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,919
I know about it.

73
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,599
If you give the order,

74
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,719
Her Highness is not feeling well?

75
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,080
I,

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,599
Special permission to go to Nanshan Zizhu Palace for cultivation.

77
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll depart today.

78
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,400
Do you understand what I mean?

79
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,919
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,840
Yeyi,

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,039
Yes

82
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,120
Where is Her Highness now?

83
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
Follow Her Highness'secret guards to report that Her

84
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,800
Highness escaped from the city and returned to the capital.

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,919
The most dangerous place

86
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,039
is the safest place.

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,719
My empress

88
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
is becoming more and more interesting.

89
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,240
Master smiled.

90
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,120
Looks like someone is going to suffer.

91
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,120
So scary.

92
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,759
Come on.

93
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,479
Don't miss it when you pass by.

94
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,639
There seems to be some excitement ahead. Come on,

95
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,680
let's go and have a look.

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,960
Come on.

97
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,400
Go into the shop and have a look.

98
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,400
There won't be such a shop after this village.

99
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Come and have a look.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,840
If you can't buy it, you can't lose money and you can't be fooled.

101
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,199
My sister's new store is opening today.

102
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,199
It's a big surprise and reward.

103
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,120
10% off for one.

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
20% off for two

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,759
and 75% off for three.

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
Your shop looks like a ready-to-wear shop.

107
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,959
What kind of clothes are they selling?

108
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,000
Take it easy.

109
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,720
It's about to be revealed.

110
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,160
Big size women's clothing store,

111
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,199
so what kind of clothes are they selling?

112
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,639
It's the clothes worn by a plump,

113
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,639
beaded woman like me,

114
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:52,879
Cut,

115
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,519
Hey, don't go.

116
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,560
My Lady,

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,959
the opening day

118
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,759
is so bleak.

119
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,560
I remember someone

120
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,000
shamelessly said that

121
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,800
he wanted to blind me.

122
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,639
There are so many people these days.

123
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,439
You insisted on admitting that you're a dog.

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,519
Yes.

125
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,439
You,

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,920
Why are you so arrogant?

127
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,920
Cut,

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,879
When you close the door and turn down the stove,

129
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,839
how arrogant will you be?

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,560
Okay.

131
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,160
Then open your eyes

132
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,439
and see,

133
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,000
How long can I be arrogant?

134
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,480
You,
