1
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,880
Ever since I won the catwalk competition last time,

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,039
now,

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,199
Every garment shop

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,679
sells the same dresses as us,

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,160
It's even cheaper.

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,679
What should we do?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,839
Oh,

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,600
and the monthly dividend promised to the former wife of shop-owner.

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,960
We still have a long way to go.

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,479
Hey,

11
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,880
I don't think

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,359
you're in a hurry,

13
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,079
What happens when something gets popular?

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,479
Counterfeit versions will naturally emerge one after another.

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,799
This is an inevitable rule.

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,240
unless

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,640
There's copyright protection,

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,079
otherwise there's nothing we can do.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,200
Copyright protection.

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,399
Copyright protection,

21
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,719
to put it simply,

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,439
It's your own original stuff.

23
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,120
If someone plagiarizes it,

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,560
they can report it to the government.

25
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,319
That's a good idea.

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,920
Miss,

27
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,760
what should we do now?

28
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:12,560
Don't worry.

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,000
I already have a plan.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,599
In order to save the hearts of customers,

31
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,040
we launched exclusive customization,

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
Provide exclusive service,

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,480
and create a limited edition of this one for individuals.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,359
After all, no one wants to bump into someone else's shirt.

35
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,239
The first step is to distinguish exclusive services

36
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,879
from ordinary consumption,

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,840
We have to launch a lot of membership activities,

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,439
like,

39
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,840
We'll hold sweepstakes,

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
buy clothes and bags, and so on.

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,840
So that customers can really

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,760
enjoy the discount on the purchase.

43
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,159
The second step is exclusive customization,

44
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,719
which will make it more fit

45
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,920
and fit.

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
It makes every piece of clothing unique.

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,719
It also makes everyone who puts on clothes,

48
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,840
unique.

49
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,000
Thereby avoiding

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
low-price plagiarism of other ready-to-wear shops,

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
The third step

52
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,280
is to continuously introduce

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
limited-edition new products in the future,

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
to hold fashion shows,

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,879
to create a brand-name effect,

56
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,439
VIP service

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,439
not only demonstrates the identity and status of customers,

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,599
It also satisfies the customer's superiority in consumption.

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,199
Thereby cultivating the customer's consumption loyalty.

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,439
To achieve stable store revenue,

61
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,599
I believe that as long as we can do this,

62
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,039
The business of the store will get better and better.

63
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,240
I want this too.

64
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I'll take one of these, too.

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,919
It's beautiful.

66
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
Su Jinxia,

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,439
how many surprises can you bring me?

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,479
It suits your skin color very well.

69
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,840
Take a closer look.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
This way, please.

71
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,319
Miss,

72
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,400
this way. Welcome next time.

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
This is designed by our boss himself.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,879
Isn't it beautiful?

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,919
The business across the street is so good,

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,479
we have to do something about it.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
Come again next time.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
What do you think of this style?

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,080
This way, please.

80
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Welcome.

81
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,199
Do you like it?

82
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,639
This fabric is very good,

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,800
Boss,

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,719
I've come up with an idea.

85
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,439
Hello. Please come in.

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,240
Go now.

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,120
Okay.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,719
Boss,

89
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,879
just take a good look.

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,800
I didn't expect that

91
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,479
you would listen to the murder

92
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,879
because you wanted to hide your identity,

93
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,639
I can't recognize you with the Holy Lord.

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,639
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
