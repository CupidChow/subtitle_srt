1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,080
Pearl,

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,599
Pearl,

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,359
I'm here.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,120
I'm here.

5
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,399
Miss,

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,320
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,239
Shh.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,000
Pearl,

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,399
go get the doctor.

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,920
Remember not to reveal his identity.

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:33,560
Yes.

12
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,119
Be careful.

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,679
You didn't listen to me

14
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,399
and acted without permission.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,560
Do you know what the consequences are?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,119
I'm also thinking about the great cause of the Holy Lord.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,359
If Qin Molin doesn't die in a single day,

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,759
the great cause will be hard to achieve,

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,960
Should I reward you?

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,399
As loyal as you are,

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,679
I dare not,

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,200
Is Qin Molin

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,119
dead or alive?

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,239
I don't know,

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,760
after Qin Molin was stabbed,

26
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,239
He escaped.

27
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,359
No trace.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,519
It's no use

29
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,879
keeping a disobedient dog.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,079
Clean him up.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Continue to trace Qin Molin's whereabouts.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,719
I want to see a person alive or a corpse dead.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,480
also

34
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,159
Inform Hearing Murder

35
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,280
that I want to meet him.

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,560
Yes

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,599
Take care, doctor.

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,719
Take care.

39
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,640
My Lady,

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,920
didn't you go out to look for materials?

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,920
Why did you bring His Majesty back?

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,760
Your Majesty,

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,079
why are you here?

44
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,560
And he got hurt.

45
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,680
Is it another plot of rebellion?

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,879
It's so dangerous.

47
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,360
I'd better stay out of it.

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,199
No way.

49
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,919
After all, he saved me twice.

50
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,560
We can't just leave him in disarray.

51
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,719
Gosh.

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,120
Also,

53
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,560
what's wrong with His Majesty's injury?

54
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,960
I don't know.

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,879
I ran away from the palace,

56
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,719
because I wanted to live a peaceful life.

57
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,960
But I still couldn't escape.

58
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
This must be God's will.

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,919
By the way, Miss,

60
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,599
you haven't eaten yet, have you?

61
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,680
I'll get you something to eat.

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,719
Go cook some porridge.

63
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,919
He can drink it when he wakes up.

64
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,280
Yes.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,599
Tell me

66
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,639
Why can't I run away from you?

67
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,240
No, no, no.

68
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,520
This scene is simply inviting people to commit crimes.

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,759
This room is too stuffy.

70
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,960
I need to get some fresh air.

71
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,000
Su Jinxia, what are you thinking about every day?

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,960
Is she injured?

73
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,159
But he's so handsome.

74
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:19,879
Master,

75
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,519
I didn't expect that,

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
How could Her Highness show up there?

77
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,920
Why am I confused?

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,759
Why did His Majesty leave?

79
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,839
I don't know

80
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,879
what to do with the plan, either. What should I do?

81
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,600
Come out.

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,360
Cancel the plan.

83
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,759
In my lifetime,

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,079
I can't believe I saw my master

85
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,560
being carried away by a woman.

86
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:54,959
Me,

87
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,560
I won't be silenced, will I?

88
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,360
Her body is so warm.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Be careful.

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Slow down.

91
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,959
It's like the temperature of my mother when I was a child.

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,759
You knew you would be in danger,

93
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
but you still chose to save me.

94
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,480
She's really different from others.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,439
It's not your fault

96
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,199
that the empress had an accident.

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,759
How is it going?

98
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,399
Did the snake get out of its hole?

99
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,439
The snake has come out of the cave,

100
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,399
Master.

101
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,639
Shouldn't we go back to the palace?

102
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,079
I was seriously injured,

103
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,480
so of course I have to stay with Her Highness.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,639
Take good care of your injury.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,839
Seriously injured,

106
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,360
Master,

107
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,800
if the doctor comes later,

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,519
Your wound is about to heal.

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
Don't think I didn't see you sweating yourself

110
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,480
with your internal energy,

111
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,759
I tricked Her Highness into wiping your sweat.

112
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,079
Inform Eunuch Li.

113
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,120
Ask him to send me

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,079
to Zizhu Residence tomorrow morning to visit the empress,

115
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,439
It will take a few days for the news to be announced.

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,639
Send the memorial to Zizhu Villa,

117
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,480
and bring it to me for review.

118
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,600
Boss,

119
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,279
I heard from Pearl,

120
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,480
Your friend got hurt?

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,399
Yes.

122
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,720
My friend is injured.

123
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,879
Just friends, right?

124
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,920
Men or women,

125
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,720
there's never been a man

126
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,160
around the empress.

127
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,680
Madam,

128
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,519
what is Qin Molin up to?
