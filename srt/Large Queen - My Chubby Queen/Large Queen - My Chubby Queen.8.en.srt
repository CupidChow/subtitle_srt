1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,119
What?

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,760
Su Jinxia from the other courtyard is fake.

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,519
Yes,

4
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,000
When I sneaked into the courtyard,

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,800
I found that the real Su Jinxia wasn't there,

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,559
Only one substitute is there

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,640
Su Jinxia is not in the courtyard,

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,399
Is it possible that Qin Molin doesn't know

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,879
what's going on?

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,640
Continue to investigate Su Jinxia's whereabouts,

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
and once you find him,

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,479
No need to report.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
Kill him immediately.

14
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,159
Yes, Your Highness.

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,600
Why are you still standing there?

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,640
Your Majesty,

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:47,520
in a few days,

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,399
Qin Molin will go hunting in the paddock,

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,399
which is a good chance to get rid of him.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,600
Qin Molin, I have my own plans,

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,039
Yes.

22
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,240
What?

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,120
The Holy Lord still refuses to kill Qin Molin.

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,319
The Holy Lord is stubborn,

25
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,519
Please listen to Lord Sha's decision.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
Master can't see clearly sometimes,

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,599
so he needs us as his subordinates,

28
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,079
Choose a path forward for her.

29
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,480
Your Excellency, you mean.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,560
Kill,

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Yes.

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,879
My Lady,

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,599
you're not really going to make a bet

34
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,719
with Shopkeeper Chen.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,159
If you lose,

36
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,439
don't you want to bark like a dog?

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,640
How can this work?

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,319
My Lady,

39
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,719
you are the body of a daughter,

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,959
What's the point of barking like a dog?

41
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,239
I won't lose a piece of meat.

42
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,519
But.

43
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,959
A big girl can bend and stretch.

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,560
Besides,

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
Why do you think I'm going to lose?

46
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,280
You look down on me.

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,439
No.

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,560
I bet with Chen Jie,

49
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,079
just to promote a large-size women's clothing store.

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,000
Ah,

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,239
Think about it,

52
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Chen Jie's ready-to-wear shop

53
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
is one of the best in our capital,

54
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,560
I bet with him,

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,680
if I win,

56
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,639
Then you'll surely become famous in the capital city.

57
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,719
If you lose,

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,479
it can also have a certain publicity effect.

59
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,319
We won't lose money this time.

60
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,360
That's right.

61
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,240
What about you,

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:22,960
Pearl?

63
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,000
Just keep an eye on the store.

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,199
You're just in time.

65
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,639
Come with me to the street.

66
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,560
Do you have a suitable model?

67
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,960
Okay.

68
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,599
Boss

69
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,039
You're a fast learner.

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
Look,

71
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,319
look at her fat face,

72
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,080
There's a fat girl here,

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,919
whose butt is almost as big as mine.

74
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,840
It's three.

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
She's fatter than a pig,

77
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,560
If I were so fat,

78
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,599
I would have killed myself,

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,599
Come on,

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,479
let's go back and eat some pig food.

81
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,680
Get out of the way!

82
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,599
Where else can you go?

83
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,759
That's right.

84
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,520
Ouch,

85
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
Who hit me?

86
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,000
Hum,

87
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,840
It's your aunt, me,

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:04,919
fatso,

89
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,960
You don't want to live anymore, do you?

90
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,719
I'll teach you a lesson.

91
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,520
Wu Yue,

92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,319
Humph.

93
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,360
Let's go!

94
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,400
That's the way it is.

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
I don't know what's wrong

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,639
with models, do I?

97
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,759
But,

98
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,960
if I can help Miss Su,

99
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm willing to give it a try.

100
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,680
That's great.

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,360
Without further ado,

102
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,840
Pearl,

103
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,400
You help Juan measure himself.

104
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,280
What about me?

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Now I'm going to find some materials

106
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,120
in the woods. I'll go with you.

107
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,599
I'd better not.

108
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,719
You're so weak.

109
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,759
If you faint,

110
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,080
I have to carry you back.

111
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,960
I'll be right back.

112
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:00,639
I'm leaving.

113
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,560
Miss, come back early.

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,199
I have a little donkey,

115
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,199
and she never rides it.

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,800
Your Majesty,

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,079
why are you here?

118
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,879
And he got hurt.

119
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,759
Is it another plot of rebellion?

120
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,560
It's such a dangerous matter,

121
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
I'd better stay out of it.
