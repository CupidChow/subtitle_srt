Get out of the way.

The yamen is taking people,

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,240
Miss,

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,320
What's going on outside?

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,439
I'll go check it out.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,159
Yes.

00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,880
Go ahead.

Okay,

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,679
Do the math carefully.

19
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,119
If it weren't for myself, how could I know it?

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,719
Where the hell is Wu Yue?

21
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,759
Your Highness, to buy clothes,

22

what can I do for you?

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,880
Someone reported that

00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,039
you committed a crime of infringement,

25
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,600
Who did I invade?

26
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,560
I didn't invade anyone.

27
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,079
Cut the crap!

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,880
Are you mistaken?

29
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,520
Now come back to the mansion with us

30

I didn't invade anyone?

36
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,320
Your Highness,

37
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,920
this is a misunderstanding.

38
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,079
Let's talk.

39
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:01,920
Invade what?

40
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,560
Boss,

41
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,600

42
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,079

Shopkeeper Chen across the street was caught.

46
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,920
For what?

47
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,040
He said he committed the crime of protecting copyright

48
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,280
in the new policy introduced by the emperor,

49
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,760
Infringement or something,

50
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,680
by the way,

51
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,560
the woman who came to make trouble before,

52
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,959
He's also the one who found it.

53
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,280
That's too bad.

54
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,959
Protect copyright,

55
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,719
Yes.

56
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
Qin Molin will be a good emperor.

57
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,400
Qin Molin,

58
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,799
didn't I tell you to take good care of yourself?

59
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,480
Why are you here?

60
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,480
I'll be here.

61
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,159
Of course it's because you're thinking about me.

62
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,319
Qin Molin,

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,439
what are you doing here?

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,199
Don't you feel bored being alone in the palace?

65
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,840
Why are you here again?

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,719
I told you,

67
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,879
if you miss me,

68
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,120
I'll show up.

69
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,960
Qin Molin,

70
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,439
why are you afraid to face me?

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,199
Lovesickness for the shadow,

72
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,599
I seem to be really sick.

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,840
I've found Su Jinxia's whereabouts.

74
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,199
You should go now.

75
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,080
Kill her!

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,080
Well,

77
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,240
What?

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,639
What do you think?

79
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,439
According to Lord Sha's order,

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,840
he intends to use Su Jinxia's life

81
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,599
to threaten Su You'an to rebel.

82
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,599
Don't hurt her life.

83
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,080
Listen to kill this old man,

84
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,719
even if you don't need to kill Lou's power,

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,800
I can also take Su Jinxia's life.

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,919
Miss Zhang,

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,520
Miss Zhang,

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,680
I'm Shopkeeper Su.

89
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Miss Zhang,

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm here to deliver the clothes.

91
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,960
Miss Zhang,
