1
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,320
This color suits you very well.

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,679
Are you satisfied?

3
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,480
This fabric is nice,

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,320
this dress is okay,

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,120
Come and take a look.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,199
This is a black shop.

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,559
The clothes I bought yesterday

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,120
are like this today.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,879
That's impossible.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,879
The quality of clothes in our shop has always been very good,

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,640
but here's the truth,

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,079
Do you still want to default?

13
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:29,760
You.

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,879
What's wrong?

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,439
She said,

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,119
the clothes she bought in our store yesterday,

17
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,359
That's what happened today.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,439
Well,

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,000
Let me take a look at the clothes

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,479
first. This guest,

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,320
Calm down.

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,159
If there is something wrong with our clothes,

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,719
we will be responsible for it.

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,840
Let me have a look first.

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,280
Boss,

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,679
the show is starting.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,799
This dress doesn't belong to us.

28
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,719
What do you mean?

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,319
Gosh,

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,879
profiteers are bullying us ordinary people,

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,640
Is there any law left?

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,000
You don't have to spill it here.

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,159
Since I said this dress is not ours,

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,560
of course it's because we have evidence,

35
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,280
Ladies and gentlemen at the scene,

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,159
please witness with me.

37
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:29,920
Yes.

38
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,040
Shopkeeper Su,

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
don't you want evidence?

40
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,280
Where is the evidence?

41
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,000
Please calm down,

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,480
I don't believe you can get through it safely.

43
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,400
Look,

44
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,920
the clothes in our shop,

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
It has the unique logo

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,560
of our large size women's clothing store,

47
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,040
But this dress

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,200
is not very obvious,

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,640
These are not our clothes.

50
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,599
My lady, you're amazing.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,920
How could there be a woman like her?

52
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,640
Strong confidence.

53
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,599
Where is she?

54
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,319
Wu Yue,

55
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,879
come here.

56
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,960
Okay Boss,

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,960
I want to show you today's account.

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,879
Be careful

59
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,759
Boss, you're so powerful.

60
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,960
Is my spring coming?

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,319
Jinxia,
