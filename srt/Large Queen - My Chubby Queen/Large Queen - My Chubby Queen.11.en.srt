1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,480
I didn't know that

2
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,399
my empress was so charming.

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,480
Just a few days after I left the palace,

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
I already have Lan Yan's bosom friend.

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,399
Your Majesty,

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,800
if you say that,

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,679
I would think His Majesty is jealous.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,200
If I'm really jealous,

9
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,679
what about Her Highness?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,439
If Your Majesty likes to be jealous,

11
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,039
I'll ask Pearl to cook tomorrow.

12
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,079
Add more vinegar,

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,079
and,

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,280
Since His Majesty is outside the palace now,

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,640
don't let me come and go.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,799
So as not to reveal his identity.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,280
After the empress left the palace,

18
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,960
she became bolder and bolder.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,880
Of course.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
It's on my turf now.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,479
You can't be pushed around by me.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,359
How does Her Highness want to manipulate me?

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,280
Su Jinxia,

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,599
this is a battle of dignity,

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,959
We can't lose.

26
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,879
Let's see what new tricks you have.

27
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,359
It's only been a few days,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,040
but the anti-flirting trick doesn't work.

29
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,239
Oh,

30
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,480
I admit defeat.

31
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,239
I won't mess with you anymore.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,079
Your wound is bleeding.

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,599
Let me bandage it for you.

34
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,480
I knew the empress

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
had been coveting my body for a long time.

36
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,919
You don't have to take the initiative.

37
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,240
You darned monster.

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
Have you gained weight recently?

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,639
Ah,

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,360
I don't think so.

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
Why do you say that?

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,919
Then why are you getting more and more important

43
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,120
in my heart.

44
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,199
I can't stand you.

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,599
I didn't expect that we started to play local love words in ancient times.

46
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,560
What kind of local love words?

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,199
I'll scratch you to death.

48
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,840
Are you okay?

49
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:53,759
Does it hurt?

50
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,080
I lied to you.

51
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,560
She stayed by my side all night.

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,199
After I met her,

53
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,280
I couldn't help but want to laugh.

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,480
Pearl,

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,759
you're here.

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,199
Your Majesty,

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,399
Childe Qin.

58
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,079
I'm your lady's husband.

59
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,839
Just call me uncle.

60
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes.

61
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,560
Young Master,

62
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,279
your lady was exhausted last night.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,800
Don't wake her up.

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,680
Boss didn't sleep in the same bed

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
with skinny hemp stalks last night, did he?

66
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,639
Yes.

67
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,399
Young Master.

68
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
Did I call Miss?

69
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,000
Fight with me.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,240
You're not qualified.
