1
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,239
Based on this familiar feeling,

2
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,839
I might be suffering from water stress recently.

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,640
You can even hit someone and plot a rebellion

4
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,399
by giving me a dress. What?

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,679
Nothing will happen to me.

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,280
Don't you want to move on?

7
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,920
Su Jinxia,

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
you're finally in my hands.

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,320
Lin Rouyi,

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,719
you are more pleasing to the eye when you play hard.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,320
I sent people to kill you many times,

12
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,320
but you escaped.

13
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,920
Let's see if you still have

14
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,039
this kind of luck this time?

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,600
Actually, I don't quite understand.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,560
Why do you have to kill me?

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,039
As a dying man,

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,719
it doesn't matter if I tell you.

19
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,039
I used to be the princess of the previous dynasty,

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,520
working undercover beside Qin Molin

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,439
in order to restore the great cause.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,599
But I didn't expect that

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,000
I actually fell in love with Qin Molin,

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,560
I fell in love with the son of my enemy.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,640
I was thinking of killing the old emperor,

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,040
Qin Molin taking the throne,

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,879
If I can marry Qin Molin

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,000
and give birth to the prince.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,200
Inherit the throne.

30
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,319
It also completed the great cause of recovery.

31
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,640
But your appearance,

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,319
just messed up my plan?

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,239
I can't wait to break your bones and raise your ashes.

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,599
Your Majesty,

35
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,280
Su Jinxia can't be killed.

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,480
Keep her to restrain Qin Molin and Su You'an.

37
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,480
is the best choice.

38
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,920
Please be patient, Your Majesty.

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
It's impossible.

40
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,159
Your Majesty.

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,319
It turns out that you, a princess,

42
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,120
don't just say whatever you want,

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,519
Even if, as you wish,

44
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,039
you can give birth to a prince and inherit the throne.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,280
Aren't you also a puppet at the mercy of others?

46
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,599
You don't have to drive a wedge

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,879
between the two of you,

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,400
You still need me to provoke you.

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,759
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,000
if you can't bear it, you'll make a big plan.

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,400
Your Majesty.

52
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,520
Brother,

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,879
Shh.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Shh.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Little brother,

56
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,280
why are you here?

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
I went to the store to look for you.

58
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,960
Pearl said you came to the Prime Minister's Mansion

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,879
and didn't go back.

60
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm afraid something bad will happen to you.

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm coming.

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,120
You're reliable.

63
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,039
Come on.

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,120
Let's go.

65
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,199
Now that you're here,

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,919
you still want to leave?

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,240
Take them down!

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,039
You go first.

69
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:23,840
Take him down.

70
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,599
Qin Molin.

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,840
Luckily,

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,599
Qin Molin is not injured.

73
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:35,719
Let's go.

74
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,759
How could it be you?

75
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,240
You knew it long ago.

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,639
Ever since my father died suddenly,

77
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,639
I've been suspicious of you.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
The reason why I didn't arrest you,

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,719
is just to draw out

80
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,759
this spy who's buried deep,

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Prime Minister Situ.

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,800
Prime Minister Situ,

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,120
you're really good at acting.

84
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,919
If I hadn't designed to be assassinated on purpose,

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to lure you out, you old fox.

86
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,919
Take them away.

87
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:12,639
Put him in jail.

88
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,479
Hold on.

89
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,879
Don't you have anything to say to me?

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,240
I have nothing to say.

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,160
I'm the one who thinks too much of myself.

92
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,680
If I had listened to them earlier, I would have killed you.

93
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,879
The great cause has been achieved,

94
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,560
and I actually fell in love with you, the son of my enemy.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,879
Such a miserable end.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,759
I'm not willing to accept it.

97
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,240
Su Jinxia,

98
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,800
go to hell!

99
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,040
Your Majesty.

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:14,959
Your Majesty,
