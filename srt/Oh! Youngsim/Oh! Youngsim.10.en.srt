(Oh! YoungSim)

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,460
So this was...

10
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,390
my birthday present 20 years ago.

11
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,159
Yes.

12
00:00:58,929 --> 00:00:59,960
But...

13
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,129
I couldn't give it to the birthday boy...

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,140
because he disappeared.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,670
Why did you...

16
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,879
disappear without saying goodbye all those years ago?

17
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,378
(Oh Young Sim)

18
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,950
What are you doing? Hand them back.

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,849
Where did you find these?

20
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,090
It's none of your business.

21
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,489
Are you kidding me?

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,159
Remember the headphones?

23
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,730
The headphones were really important to me.

24
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,900
I gave them away because it was you.

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,370
When I saw that some guy had the headphones,

26
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:44,540
I couldn't think straight.

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,709
You should have asked me.

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,749
I lent them to him only for a few days...

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,049
because of a personal reason.

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,719
I just assumed you gave them away because they meant nothing.

31
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,189
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,599
I lost the headphones you cherished.

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,930
I can't even buy them now.

34
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,639
But you know what?

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,310
I have them...

36
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,509
although...

37
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,650
they are broken.

38
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,319
Really?

39
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,120
Then why didn't you tell me?

40
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,060
I realized something from that incident.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,060
That you would never like me back.

42
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,870
That's not true.

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,210
Then why did you treat me like that?

44
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,009
You never accepted my feelings for you.

45
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,159
I guess I wanted to bully you...

46
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,860
because I wanted to know...

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,870
if you would still like me despite the bullying.

48
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,840
But still. You were so mean.

49
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,349
But...

50
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,319
you didn't like me enough...

51
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,280
to have faith in me, did you?

52
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,990
No.

53
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,590
I didn't feel confident about myself. That's all, Young Sim.

54
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,930
So what about now?

55
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,169
Are you confident now?

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,740
In a way, I have you to thank...

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,780
for pushing me to get where I am.

58
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,580
To be someone I was proud of,

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,280
I lived diligently.

60
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,759
Then since you gave me credit for your successful career,

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,659
grant me a wish.

62
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,899
Remember what you said?

63
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,600
My wish...

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,870
is that Young Sim's wish comes true.

65
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:31,579
That's all I need.

66
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,649
How do you know that?

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,519
I watched the footage when I was editing it.

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,990
I'll cash in...

69
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,290
that wish.

70
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,959
This is my wish.

71
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,339
That...

72
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,569
we completely stay true to our feelings.

73
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,759
(Episode 10: For Our Humiliating Past)

74
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,470
We don't have enough clips to air for Min Ji and Woo Chan.

75
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,740
Nothing really happened with them.

76
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,240
We need something that's going to leave an impact on the viewers.

77
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:43,920
Please sit.

78
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,120
I'll sit over there today.

79
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,959
Do you have any good ideas?

80
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,569
How about a date in school uniforms?

81
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,769
School uniforms?

82
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,669
You will go on a double date.

83
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,139
But you and Mr. Wang don't have any connection with the kids.

84
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,339
So I thought making you look like their real friends would be nice.

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,339
A lot of couples go on dates in school uniforms now.

86
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,378
Right. My boyfriend and I took those instant sticky pictures...

87
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,619
in our old school uniforms this weekend.

88
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,220
We had more fun than we thought.

89
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,389
That's why...

90
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,958
we brought the school uniforms of Manna High School.

91
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,529
- Ta-Da. - Ta-Da.

92
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,500
But I'm too old to wear school uniforms.

Kyung Tae?

94
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,410
- Yes. - You're okay with this, right?

95
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,819
Well, there's no way...

96
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,720
Right?

97
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,660
This is too much for you. Right?

98
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,259
No. Wait.

99
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,069
Given the effort you made, I should at least put that on.

100
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,040
- Really? - Yes.

101
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,069
Just don't be so shocked because I look too young in it.

102
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,179
I'm worried that...

103
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,879
I might get an offer to be a school uniform commercial.

104
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,180
That sounds fun.

105
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,860
Come on, we make variety shows. Can't you take a joke?

106
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,069
Let's laugh about it.

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
You said...

108
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,769
we should be extra strict when it came to jokes.

109
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,509
Kyung Tae.

110
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,209
What's that on your neck?

111
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,949
What? Is something on my neck?

112
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,050
Take it off. What is it?

113
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,790
- That's... - Gosh.

114
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,519
What?

115
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,359
Is that...

116
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,930
- Oh, my. Kyung Tae, my man! - What is it?

117
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,730
What is it?

118
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,029
Gosh. It's not what you think. No way.

119
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,300
- You have a dirty mind. - What is that?

120
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,670
Keep working.

121
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,269
Focus on your work.

122
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,509
- Is it what we think it is? - That's...

123
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,850
Did we really see a Hickey on Kingvely's CEO's neck?

124
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,090
Young Sim, do you know anything?

125
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,889
I got something in my windpipe.

126
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,269
Hurry.

127
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,508
- I don't want to go. - Gosh.

128
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,039
Hurry up. People will come.

129
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,759
I didn't know life was this beautiful.

130
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,659
All right.

131
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,799
What is he doing? That's so cute.

132

133
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,168
- Young Sim. - Hey, Sang Eun. What?

134
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,340
- Did you see this? - What is it?

00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,899
Gosh. I thought I was going to get caught.

00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,299
Wang Kyung Tae. Were you two-timing me?

139

No.

140
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,340
I know nothing about that.

141
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,950
I'm quite flustered.

142
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,450
I get the feeling that Wol Sook was involved in this.

143
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,590
Oh, hello.

144
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,758
Yes. I was drunk during my livestream...

145
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,490
and blurted that out. That ended up in the articles.

146
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,399
I never said his real name.

147

I see.

How am I going to fix it this time?

149
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:40,080
I should issue a correction notice and put out my side of the story.

150
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,778
I'll talk to Soon Sim.

151

given what already happened,

So?

158
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,730
We should wait and see where this goes.

159
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,440
But only until this helps the show.

160

167
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,169
I'm not sure.

168
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,980
I need to go back in now.

169

I'll call you tomorrow. Okay? See you tomorrow.

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,110
I'll go.

171
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm really leaving.

172
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't be so disappointed. Please?

173
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,200
I'm leaving for real this time.

174
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,820
Kyung Tae, I'm filming a video for my channel tonight.

175
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,259
Can you help me out?

176
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,559
I'll see you at my house.

177
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,399
His house?

178
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,429
Come on. Aren't things going too fast?

179
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,399
Oh, my.

180
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:52,840
You're here.

181
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,379
Hey, Kyung Tae.

182
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,220
So this is your house.

183
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,649
You have a great place.

184
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,850
I wouldn't have minded if we met outside.

185
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,269
- You haven't eaten yet, right? - No.

186
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,429
Wait.

187
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,100
Then can I look around the house while you prepare the meal?

188
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,639
Go ahead. I'll call you when I'm ready.

189
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,590
Gosh. Look at the chandelier. I wonder how much that is.

190
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,659
The house is clean.

191
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:43,559
But it's too empty...

192
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,360
as if he's going to move soon.

193
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,970
What's that?

194
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,110
Oh, my. Did you prepare everything?

195
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,049
No. I ordered them.

196
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,220
What? I see.

197
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,720
It's always better when experts do it.

198
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,789
Dig in.

199
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,519
Okay.

200
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,960
Kyung Tae.

201
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,070
Have you read it?

202
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,669
The article about us?

203
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,970
Yes.

204
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,979
Those reporters...

205
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,250
must have exaggerated what I said during my livestream.

206
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,619
But what do you think...

207
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,480
about using this chance to get to know each other more?

208
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,289
We have a lot of things in common too.

209
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,259
Like what?

210
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,960
We are both experts in our fields and are passionate.

211
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,129
And we're recognized in our fields too.

212
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,029
Right. If there's something we want, we always get it no matter what.

213
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,870
Do you want something from me?

214
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,110
Isn't it obvious...

215
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,149
what I want?

216
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,179
Wol Sook.

217
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,820
Are you attracted to someone similar to you?

218
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
What?

219
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,830
I hate people who are similar to me.

220
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,129
Why do you like me?

221
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,299
What?

222
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,669
Well...

223
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:37,369
I was some neighbourhood loser you were never interested in.

224
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,509
Now that I'm a CEO of a company and became famous,

225
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,179
I seem like a different guy.

226
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,879
So you must have been curious about me.

227
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,450
Yes. I'll admit that.

228
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,490
But isn't that how everyone feels?

229
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,259
Right. But you know what?

230
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,129
That's what I thought too.

231
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,100
But not me.

232
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,299
Then what kind of person are you attracted to?

233
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,379
Someone who's polar opposite from me.

234
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,309
Someone who's not calculative,

235
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,549
who wears her heart on her sleeve,

236
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,590
and who believes in sincerity over strategies.

237
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,830
Someone who doesn't give up even when she gets...

238
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,759
the short end of the stick.

239
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,769
What has Young Sim done for you?

240
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,440
How am I so different from her?

241
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,740
Wol Sook.

242
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,710
You've never truly loved anyone, right?

243
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,120
You think love is a game.

244
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,120
You're used to finding a man and winning him over.

245
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,319
Then someone becomes a winner...

246
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,419
who has control over the relationship.

247
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,929
One of them has more power over the other.

248
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,029
Is that so bad?

249
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,970
I used to think just like you before.

250
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,869
But that doesn't suit me.

251
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,680
So you shouldn't try so hard.

252
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,380
Kyung Tae.

253
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,589
Your first childhood crush isn't eternal love.

254
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,319
Give me your love too.

255
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,960
You're mistaken that you like me because of your competitive side.

256
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,230
Would you have liked me even if I was the same boy...

257
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,200
from all those years ago?

258
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,189
(Request to return to head office)

(Urgent, quarterly report)

260
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,369
Did you receive the quarterly report?

261
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,499
Please let me know when you will come back...

262
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,869
and I'll set up the meeting with Mr. Stark.

263
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,150
Oh Young Sim.

264
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,980
I'm really running out of time.

265
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,130
(The CEO of a Unicorn Startup Is Dating a Famous YouTuber?)

266
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,099
No.

267
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,869
I should focus on the show for now.

268
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,200
I mean, it's nice. I don't have to try to promote the show.

269
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:55,170
I should think that the universe is helping me.

270
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,538
I really need this show to do well.

271
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,109
I just have to focus on doing a better job.

272
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,380
Come in.

273
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,390
- Young Sim. - You're here.

274
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,589
- You must be tired. - No.

275
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,960
Should I help you with the rest?

276
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,529
No.

277
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,190
I'm so excited that I'm not even tired.

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,799
Our show has to do well.

279
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,969
Young Sim, you said yes to wearing the school uniform.

280
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,069
You're the best.

281
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,140
That's nothing. As long as it helps our show,

282
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,409
I'm willing to dance and sing in the center of the busy street...

283
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,579
next to Gangnam Station.

284
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,578
Young Sim, I can't believe you said yes to filming the show...

285
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:35,749
and going on a double date...

286
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,650
with a guy who came back to take his revenge.

287
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,420
You are the most patient person ever.

288
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,519
Well, it's just business.

289
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,359
I really want to do well this time.

290
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,400
But do you still not like Mr. Wang?

291
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,799
He's not the nicest guy, but he's pretty cool.

292
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,140
Gosh, no.

293
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,539
I hate men like him.

294
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,339
Besides,

295
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,150
You never know, he might stab us in the back again.

296
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,318
We're both doing it for our work.

297
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,149
It's good for him and his company,

298
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,049
and we need the show to do well.

299
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,549
So don't worry about it too much.

300
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,920
Right? I guess people don't really change.

301
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Then...

302
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:24,629
Should we pair Mr. Wang with Wol Sook...

303
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,299
and try to set them up?

304
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,529
Set them up?

305
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,969
With the way things are,

306
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,970
I think Mr. Wang and Wol Sook might be a better fit for the next date.

307
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,210
I see.

308
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:38,640
Don't you agree?

309
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,609
I think it would be all right.

310
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,119
It is all right. That would be fine.

311
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,679
If it means our show will do well,

312
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,818
I'd sing them a celebratory song with them standing at the altar.

313
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,859
Really?

314
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,859
Of course.

315
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,759
Nothing is more dramatic and exciting on a dating show...

316
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,759
than members of the crew dating.

317
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,049
There must be a more provocative way to say this.

318
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,690
I really need this to do well.

319
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,559
I said it was fine, Sang Eun.

320
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,130
Kyung Tae?

321
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,099
What am I to you?

322
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,569
What?

323
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,369
You care more about the show than you do about me.

324
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,039
What are you saying?

325
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,150
I'm asking if people's feelings don't matter to you...

326
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,279
if they get in the way of what you're trying to do.

327
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,250
What's wrong?

328
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,319
Is this about the article?

329
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,589
Or about what I said in the car earlier?

330
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,359
I told you it was for work. Why are you being so immature?

331
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:11,369
"Immature?"

332
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,440
Yes, immature.

333
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,470
You don't know why I'm still here, do you?

334
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,640
That's how you've always been. Your feelings take priority.

335
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,809
Either way, we started this show because of Kingvely.

336
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,818
This show is as important to me as Kingvely is to you.

337
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,289
But things have changed...

338
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,420
since then.

339
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,289
What has changed?

340
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,960
I guess I'm the problem again.

341
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,269
I took it too seriously.

342
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,400
If that's how you feel,

343
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,210
I'll stop right here.

344
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Wait. Kyung Tae?

345
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,109
What...

346
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,309
Darn.

347
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,849
Yes, Director Heo?

348
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,789
Have you finished editing tomorrow's preview?

349
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,149
I'm in the editing studio, finishing it up right now.

350
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,519
We have high hopes.

351
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,430
Right. It's coming along nicely.

352
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,730
Yes. I'll do my best. Thank you.

353
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,400
Goodbye.

354
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,930
But...

355
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,869
Darn.

356
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,470
Let's just get this done first.

357
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,890
You're really leaving so soon?

358
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,359
I'm sorry to see you go in such a hurry, Kyung Tae.

359
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,430
Not at all. Thank you for your hospitality.

360
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,900
Why do you sound like you're making a final goodbye?

361
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:48,299
I just think I'll be quite busy for a while.

362
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,670
Being busy is great when you're young.

363
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,640
You've got this, Mr. Wang.

364
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,809
Our director is quite busy, so we'll get going now.

365
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,279
All right. Safe travels.

366
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:00,839
I'll be in touch soon.

367
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,349
Visit us soon.

368
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,049
- I'll be in touch. - All right.

369
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,049
Oh, my.

370
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,319
Mr. Wang?

371
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,160
Your flight booking is confirmed,

372
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:25,869
Thanks.

373
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,670
Are you really leaving tomorrow?

374
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,910
Yes.

375
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,630
You're home.

376
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Kyung Tae left? Without saying a word to me?

377
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:02,039
Gosh. Didn't you know?

378
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:04,769
Well...

379
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,980
We did argue, but even so...

380
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,389
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable.

381
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,348
Please leave a message after the beep.

382
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,358
He's not answering?

383
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,390
Soon Sim? Why isn't your boss answering his phone?

384
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,500
This is ridiculous.

385
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,029
Let's end things here.

386
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,670
"End things here?"

387
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,439
- What is he saying? - The phone is turned off.

388
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,909
Please leave a message after the beep.

389
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,779
What? Why would he switch off his phone? What on earth?

390
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,480
Wait a second.

391
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,059
Did I just get dumped?

392
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,569
"End things?"

393
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,140
Fine. Leave me.

394
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:15,180
He does whatever he wants.

395
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,279
Just leave me already!

396
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,819
I'm free!

397
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,589
Young Sim! Did you drink all of this alone?

398
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Look at this.

399
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,200
He sent one line and nothing else.

400
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,440
What on earth does it mean to end things now?

401
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,210
You're the expert, so explain it to me.

402
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,349
I wondered how happy you'd be after he did that to me.

403
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:54,849
Here.

404
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,460
Experts don't exist in the worlds of relationships and shares.

405
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:02,789
What?

406
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,529
Young Sim, I was humiliated by Kyung Tae because of you.

407
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,299
Humiliated? You?

408
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,140
I don't understand it at all.

409
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,910
But the only thing that's ever on Kyung Tae's mind is Young Sim.

410
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,180
Young Sim?

411
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,519
Oh, my.

412
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,130
Your name is "Youngsimi?"

413
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,900
(Youngsimi)

414
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,639
It's sickening.

415
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,339
He's been obsessed with you for 20 whole years.

416
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,539
Then, why?

417
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,449
I made the greatest mistake ever...

418
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,809
and this is the best you can do?

419
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,750
Young Sim! Snap out of it!

420
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:05,190
Never mind that. I'll just drink my sorrows away.

421
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,559
Let's drink together.

422
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:10,960
We were rejected together, so we should drink together.

423
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,710
You're both so darn annoying!

424
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:24,539
Seriously!

425
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,539
I'm annoyed too.

426
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,849
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

427
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,849
Stop that! Stop crying.

428
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,769
Min Ji.

429
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,440
Are you talking to me?

430
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,640
Do you see any other Min Ji around?

431
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,740
What is it?

432
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,579
Are you still in touch with Ms. Young Sim?

433
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,579
No.

434
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,619
I got a strange message from Kyung Tae yesterday.

435
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,319
Here.

436
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,329
I'm leaving.

437
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,200
You should find someone else...

438
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,700
before you end up like me.

439
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,000
Don't you think...

440
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,509
we should do something about this?

441
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,079
"Do something?"

442
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,890
For Young Sim's wish to come true.

443
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,160
For Young Sim's wish to come true.

444
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,859
For Young Sim's wish to come true.

445
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,230
That jerk.

446
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,039
Selfish brat.

447
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,609
You said that's all you wanted.

448
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:08,680
Gosh. I don't know anything anymore.

449
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,288
(Min Ji)

450
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:18,318
Young Sim, please help me one last time. It's an emergency.

451
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,319
What is this?

452
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,890
What happened this time?

453
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Bye.

454
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:40,140
Is Woo Chan suddenly going to the US?

455
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,609
Where is Min Ji? She said she would meet me here.

456
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,730
How did you think to help them?

457
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,660
I got the hint from the teddy bear.

458
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:07,539
What are you doing here?

459
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,410
Where are you going?

460
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,869
It's almost time for my flight.

461
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,410
Are you going to leave just like that?

462
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,420
How could you act like this until the end?

463
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,460
You coward.

464
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,599
Fine. Keep on running away like that!

465
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,980
You're right. I might run away at an important moment again.

466
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,119
Fine. Go ahead.

467
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,650
I'll keep on chasing you to the ends of the earth.

468
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,559
Is that not enough?

469
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,359
I know you like me too.

470
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm in no position to like you again now.

471
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,400
I thought I had changed.

472
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,710
But I've started to like you again.

473
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:21,680
The scars I thought were healed have resurfaced.

474
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,809
I hate myself for it too.

475
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,319
You're such a loser.

476
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,950
It's true.

477
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,759
That's me. I can't help it.

478
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,029
If you leave like this,

479
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,960
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

480
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,640
If I can manage to change,

481
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,799
I'll come back.

482
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,369
Although I don't know when.

483
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,440
Who says I'll take you back if you return?

484
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,880
You're the worst.

485
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,509
Why did you show up...

486
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,420
in front of me if you were going to run away again?

487
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,919
Passengers heading to New York,

488
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,189
please head to gate number three.

489
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,259
Are you done?

490
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,859
I'll get going.

491
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,700
If you leave like this,

492
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,440
it's over between us!

493
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,839
Wang Kyung Tae! It's over between us!

494
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,380
I said it's over...

495
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,789
If you leave, it's really over...

496
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,130
The most shameful moment in my life...

497
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,299
has yet to come.

498
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,619
He wanted to finish the show with you,

499
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:15,289
so he pushed his trip back to the US...

500
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,960
before things got out of hand.

501
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,730
I think that's why he left in a rush.

502
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,650
(Two months later)

503
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,050
Young Sim's new show is starting.

504
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,760
(Love Mark)

505
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,829
I hope she gets a lot of views for the first episode.

506
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,500
- Is the show going well? - No.

507
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:59,539
This one is more popular these days.

508
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,699
What?

509
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:03,840
"Lust Island?"

510
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,409
Chae Dong was determined to make it.

511
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,749
I hear it's really...

512
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,110
It's really...

513
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,178
- Gosh. - Gosh.

514
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,319
Hey, turn it off.

515
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,489
- Leave it. - Gosh.

516
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,860
But your father is here.

517
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,699
After leaving "Love Mark,"

518
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:35,300
Chae Dong went to an island to shoot a documentary.

519
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,539
He created a racy variety show for adults...

520
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,779
and became known as the "lustful producer."

521
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,209
(Lust Island)

522
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,250
On top of that,

523
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,150
his show beat us in viewer ratings.

524
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,150
Goodness.

525
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,889
Hey, Lustful Chae Dong.

526
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,030
Congratulations on beating "Love Mark."

527
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,940
Wol Sook realized that someone with similar interests...

528
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,639
was closer to her than she thought.

529
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,679
As smart as she was, she got what she wanted...

530
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,039
without having to change herself.

531
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,400
(Viewer Ratings)

532
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,030
Gosh...

533
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,139
Chae Dong beat you to a pulp.

534
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,139
Yes.

535
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,679
I've been teaching my rival.

536
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,250
After this week, it's just the last episode left.

537
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:52,980
Yes.

538
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:55,690
Try to make a recovery.

539
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
I'm not sure...

540
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,219
if I can beat an island bikini party.

541
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,400
At this rate,

542
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:10,630
even good reviews won't guarantee...

543
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:15,539
a second season of the show. You know that, right?

544
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,809
Yes.

545
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,349
Good luck.

546
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,280
Let's go.

547
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,690
I'll get going.

548
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,119
Cheer up.

549
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:42,230
Maybe we need a new story that's more dramatic.

550
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,599
They're all about the same.

551
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,369
There's no way we can beat "Lust Island."

552
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:52,039
We received a new application.

553
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,948
"I was able to date my first love..."

554
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:58,209
"after many trials and tribulations,"

555
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,250
"but we ended up breaking up because of my mistake."

556
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,189
"I'm a terrible person who ghosted her twice,"

557
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,789
"but I want to turn her heart around one more time."

558
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,119
"Please help me."

559
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,360
They broke up because he ghosted. What do you think of this one?

560
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,059
No.

561
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,429
Someone like that can't be redeemed.

562
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,968
Why don't we call him to get more details first?

563
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,469
I don't like it. Let's look for someone else.

564
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,480
Let's end the meeting here. You can head home.

565
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,079
- Okay. - Okay.

566
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:41,019
Why do I feel so blue?

567
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,260
It's definitely not because of Kyung Tae.

568
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,630
Oh Young Sim.

569
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,099
Am I hearing things now?

570
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,139
Young Sim, please wake up.

571
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,039
Young Sim.

572
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,119
Wang Kyung Tae?

573
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,099
Young Sim.

574
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,269
I'm back,

575
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,639
Young Sim.

576
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:45,489
Have you been well?

577
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,070
All right.

578
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,340
I'll leave.

579
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,110
Don't go.

580
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,690
I thought something happened to you.

581
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:40,710
Even if you tell me to go away,

582
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,750
I'll stay by your side forever.

583
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,019
If you disappear without a word again,

584
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,829
I'll really chase you to the ends of the earth.

585
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,469
I'm too scared to run away now.

586
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,409
You're finally smiling.

587
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:17,710
I'm not.

588
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:20,820
That's my Young Sim.

589
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,889
You didn't get beat up enough.

590
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm home.

591
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,889
Hey.

592
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,230
Gosh. Kyung Tae.

593
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:12,300
What happened?

594
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,369
You look like a homeless guy.

595
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,769
That's right. I'm homeless.

596
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,479
There was an issue at the US headquarter.

597
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,280
I sold off my shares and closed all affiliate companies.

598
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,420
After giving everyone their severance pay,

599
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,289
I had nothing left.

600
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,889
Really?

601
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,219
Are you really homeless?

602
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,690
Yes, sir.

603
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,559
I have to start over from scratch.

604
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,699
Although I'm penniless,

605
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:46,300
would you be okay with it?

606
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,840
What?

607
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,409
Well... You should ask Young Sim.

608
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,980
Yes.

609
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,289
I'll provide for you until you're back on your feet.

610
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:07,260
I waited for 20 years already.

611
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,429
Young Sim.

612
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:14,829
But there are conditions.

613
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,500
- "Conditions?" - Yes.

614
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,209
Number one, you must move in as the son-in-law.

615
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,909
I just have to connect these.

616
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,460
Kyung Tae, I need water.

617
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,860
Do you need water?

618
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,460
Okay, it's coming.

619
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,099
Water. Here.

620
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,900
Thank you.

621
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,500
What about my three ice cubes?

622
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,070
- Ice? - Yes.

623
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,109
Okay, ice.

624
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,339
Ice.

625
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,780
Ice.

626
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,380
Number two, never disappear without a word.

627
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,718
(Be truthful, wise, and pure)

628
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,489
Where were you for 30 minutes?

629
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,889
I went for a jog.

630
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:17,460
I told you not to go around without reporting to me.

631
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:20,860
I'm sorry.

632
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,070
Also, how do you have the time to jog?

633
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:27,369
You can't waste time if you want to get back on your feet.

634
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,769
When are you going to become successful?

635
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,610
All right. If you're done jogging, go back to your office.

636
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:38,250
- All right. - Good luck.

637
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,519
Young Sim, go easy on him.

638
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,590
I feel sorry for Kyung Tae.

639
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,030
It was the life he chose.

640
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,130
Be beside me before I even ask.

641
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:04,070
Young Sim.

642
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Yes?

643
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,269
Are you determined to be with me through all of my shameful moments?

644
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,369
Gosh.

645
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:40,809
(Oh! YoungSim)

646
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:45,010
Gosh. Young Sim's line is really cool.

647
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,380
She told him to be there through all the shameful moments.

648
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:48,750
- Gosh. - Amazing.

649
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,989
I drew and wrote it,

650
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,820
but I'm embarrassed.

651
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:55,118
Why?

652
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,988
People love strong female characters like her these days.

653
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,559
A lot of women propose first now.

654
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,629
Ji Yu, did you upload your grandpa's work...

655
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,530
on the Internet?

656
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,710
I happened to see it and found it entertaining.

657
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,369
Good work.

658
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,480
My daughter is so smart.

659
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,449
- Wait a minute. - What?

660
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,848
It's getting more views than we think.

661
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:21,880
What?

662
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,259
Maybe he might have to revive the series again.

663
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,260
What?

664
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,928
- Gosh. - Wait.

665
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:33,698
- Father. - We paid our debt with that.

666
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:36,230
What? That's not the issue.

667
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,929
Father, is there anything you want?

668
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:41,639
Well, my back and my shoulders hurt.

669
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,738
A massage chair, maybe.

670
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,738
A massage chair? That's a good idea.

671
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,780

00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:51,949
I feel like...

673
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,980
the show only benefited you.

674
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,489
I'm sorry.

675
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:02,360
You'll do better next time, right?

676
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:06,800
"Next time?"

677
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,300
"Love Mark Season Two." But...

678
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:14,969
It'll be for divorced people.

679
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:19,039
- Really? - Yes.

680
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,340
- Really? - Yes.

681
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:23,948
- Really? - Yes.

682
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:25,079
Yes!

683
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,360
Dad, please add to your story that I'm doing season two.

684
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:42,429
No one else cares about that except for you.

685
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,329
That's not true. The fans are waiting.

686
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,639
Also, can you make me look pretty? I'm the female lead, after all.

687
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:50,909
People these days...

688
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,679
prefer things frank.

689
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,650
What is this?

690
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,179
How do you fix this? Erase it.

691
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:00,780
After 20 years,

692
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,119
the dating life of 34-year-old Oh Young Sim...

693
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,349
was revealed to the nation once again.

694
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:07,690
But I don't mind...

695
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,329
if my shameful past can make at least one person happy.

696
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:17,429
Although shameful pasts can feel muddy and nasty,

697
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:21,840
that is where we'll be born as pearls.

698
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,670
Is this the robot vacuum Kyung Tae made?

699
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:29,679
Shall we test it out?

700
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,920
Youngsimi, go clean.

701
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,250
Youngsimi, move.

702
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,119
Good job, Youngsimi.

703
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,960
Youngsimi, go charge.

704
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,760
What is this? It's not responding.

705
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,530
Youngsimi, I love you.

706
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,449
(Oh! YoungSim)

707
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:11,179
(Thank you for watching "Oh! YoungSim.")
