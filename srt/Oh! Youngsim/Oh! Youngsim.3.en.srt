- Yes.

177
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,790
Oh, right.

178
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,040
You two already know each other, right?

179
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,030
- Yes.
- Okay.

180
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,240
That's great! You have already worked with each other once.

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,990
What about PD Oh Young Shim?

182
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,730
Oh, yes. Young Shim?

183
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,240
She might not be able to keep working here...

184
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,300
since she's become the...

185
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,520
National Zero* Votes.
("Young" means zero in Korean)

186
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,900
Young is zero votes, and zero votes are Young Shim.

187
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,180
Young Shim is forever and ever...

188
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,040
I don't know where she got the guts, but she took a sick day.

189
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,790
Some people are saying she's going to quit.

190
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,340
Right, Chae Dong?

191
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,010
Yes, well...

192
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,040
Young Shim sunbae is someone who keeps her word.

193
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,060
Hey, hey. Hey.

194
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,870
You should convince Young Shim since you're her sidekick.

195
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,150
Sidekick?

196
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,800
By chance, if you quit along with Young Shim...

197
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,110
you're dead to me. You got that?

198
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,470
Gosh, Chief Heo, come on!

199
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,160
Right, Chief. Please excuse me. I've got a meeting to go to.

200
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Sure, go ahead. Yes, go on.

201
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,500
Is that PD and PD Oh Young Shim close?

202
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,010
Close?

203
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,920
I'm sure they're something more than that.

204
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,760
Right. I think they're always together, except when they're

205
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,550
using the bathroom and sleeping.

206
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,700
Always together?

207
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,510
Right, PD Lee!

208
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,320
Oh, yes, Wang Kyung Tae.

209
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,790
What's the matter?

210
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,890
<i>"Wang Kyung Tae"?</i>

211
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,900
That's right, Lee Chae Dong.

212
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,420
I didn't get to say thanks to you last time.

213
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,550
Thank you for last time.

214
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,130
Well, Young Shim sunbae did all the hard work.

215
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,030
Now, then.

216
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,580
Excuse me!

217
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,990
Have you worked with PD Oh for a long time?

218
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,680
Why are you curious about that?

219
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,870
Well, it was only out of curiosity.

220
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,000
But you're being really sensitive about it.

221
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,510
We've been on the same team for only a year...

222
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,200
but I love her.

223
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,060
L...

224
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,490
Love?

225
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:02,000
I think density matters more in a relationship than length of time.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,750
Did someone ask?

227
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,060
But why are you telling me that?

228
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,880
You're right.

229
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,710
Why did I?

230
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,060
All right, then.

231
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,690
He's totally a nutcase.

232
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,540
<i>I love her.</i>

233
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,870
<i>I love her.</i>

234
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,460
<i>I love her.</i>

235
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,900
Gosh, no, no.

236
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,700
No, that can't be.

237
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,620
Now's not the time to be concerned with these things.

238
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,600
Love?

239
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,260
What should I name it?

240
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,290
Shall I check how Kingvely feels?

241
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,940
<i>Am I the only one scared from watching the show?</i>

242
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,750
<i>Even though he's our CEO, he's such a loser.</i>

243
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,750
<i>He's so petty.</i>

244
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,340
<i>She seemed really moved at the end.</i>

245
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,680
<i>He just made a fool out of Young Shim.</i>

246
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,280
<i>Even so, it's only a show. Don't believe anyone.</i>

247
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,780
<i>It's just like the rumor says.</i>

248
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,740
<i>Gosh, will anyone even be brave enough to date Mark?</i>

249
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,930
<i>He's still a successful CEO.</i>

250
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,410
<i>You don't worry about those people.</i>

251
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,800
<i>But I thought Wang Kyung Tae was also going to choose Young Shim.</i>

252
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,180
<i>Gosh, now you mention it, Young Shim did choose Wang Kyung Tae.</i>

253
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,340
<i>Did Young Shim like Kyung Tae?</i>

254
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,830
[Kyung Tae]

255
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,630
[Young Shim, Kyung Tae]

256
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,320
[Sam Doo - Young Shim, Ho Jae - Young Shim]

257
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,040
[Ho Jae: writer?, Sam Doo: x]

258
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,740
Oh Young Shim...

259
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,160
Why did she choose me?

260
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,400
<i>Could I see those headphones for a second?</i>

261
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,390
[Oh Young Shim]
<i>What are you doing right now? Give it back.</i>

262
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,450
<i>Seriously.</i>

263
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,380
Whatever.

264
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,080
I'll just give it a go.

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I know this is the one.

266
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,610
Kiddo, what are you doing?

267
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,180
Wh-What did you capture?

268
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,320
Y-You can't just be taking pictures of people like that.

269
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,540
You aren't completely undressed yet, huh?

270
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,320
What are you talking about?

271
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,520
Why don't you explain yourself if you're not guilty?

272
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,830
What are you peeking at over the walls?

273
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,640
It's not like that!

274
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,360
Lee Ji Yoo, what are you doing there?

275
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,110
I caught a flasher, Mom!

276
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,500
You f***ing bastard!

277
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,310
Wh-Whoa, whoa!

278
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,370
You bastard.

279
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,090
Honey, I caught him. I did.

280
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,980
My head...

281
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,520
Wh-Whoa, wait a minute.

282
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
O-Oh, my, c-could you be...

283
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,230
That's right.

284
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,240
I'm Kyung Tae.

285
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,170
Hey, you look way better in person.

286
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,260
My goodness, I didn't even know it was you.

287
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,630
For that midget from back then-

288
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,710
I mean, the cute little boy to have succeeded like this...

289
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,540
Gosh! You're so cool!

290
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,700
You should've told us before coming, though.

291
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,720
What brought you here?

292
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,260
Well, I was starting to miss my old neighborhood when I came back to Korea from the U.S.

293
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,590
That's why I was also reminded of you all, too.

294
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,520
Sure, you're welcome here.

295
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,180
We're all still the same, right?

296
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,020
Yes, yes. Sure.

297
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,780
By the way, what about your wife?

298
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,330
Oh, my mom?

299
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,120
She went on a cruise.

300
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,890
She said housewives need sabbaticals or something, too.

301
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,500
And that's why I can't leave this house.

302
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,940
Aigoo, I wish Mom would come back quickly.

303
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,220
By the way, Kyung Tae...

304
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,880
why didn't you choose our Young Shim? I was so sad.

305
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,300
Aigoo, seriously.

306
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,500
Don't be concerned, Kyung Tae. No, I mean, CEO Wang.

307
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,450
No, you can just call me Kyung Tae, Hyungnim.

308
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,410
- Yes, please.
- How can I?

309
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,800
Oh, yes!

310
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,350
Hyungnim sounds great!

311
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,700
Aigoo, then, should I call you Son-in-Law Wang?

312
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,750
Sorry?

313
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,820
Gosh, seriously!

314
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,920
You're all being so rude to our potential son-in-law, who finally came after 20 years!

315
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,030
We'll prepare the dinner right away. So, go in the room and rest, Kyung Tae.

316
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,150
O-Okay.

317
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,450
Oh, my.

318
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,330
Kyung Tae- I mean, Son-in-Law Wang, help yourself.

319
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,130
O-Oh, okay.

320
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,010
My goodness... I'll be in your care.

321
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,060
Oh, o-okay.

322
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,140
Hey, where's your aunt?

323
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,220
Sunbae, you're okay, right?

324
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,120
I was going to buy you porridge since you're sick.

325
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,260
Your face looks haggard lately, you know.

326
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,470
My face?

327
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,720
I ate some spicy food out of stress lately.

328
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,860
I went to the bathroom a little too often.

329
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,370
I'm fine.

330
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,180
Anyhow, meat is really the only solution to tough times, right?

331
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,870
I'm going to stuff myself.

332
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,240
Let it cook before you eat.

333
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,740
Everything on here is yours, Sunbae.

334
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,760
You brought the company card, right?

335
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,590
Just do this and go. I'm going to eat tons today.

336
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,730
Aigoo, I shouldn't have chosen Wang Kyung Tae, then.

337
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,970
Gosh, seriously.

338
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,450
I was such a fool.

339
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,050
Aigoo.

340
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,390
I'll be going home now.

341
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,470
- Sure, take care.
- Yes.

342
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,360
Come again.

343
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,090
Soon Shim!

344
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,940
Secretary Oh...

345
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,790
CEO Wang, why are you here?

346
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,730
- Hello.
- Hi.

347
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,830
Please take care.

348
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,520
Young Shim is coming, too.

349
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,530
Great timing.

350
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,650
I'm an embarrassing fool!

351
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,250
Aigoo!

352
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,590
What's this?

353
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,140
Why's he here?

If it were you, would you be able to get along again?

359
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,280
Tap, tap- Tap!

360

Stop her, stop her!

361
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,600

- You!

362
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,330
Kyung Tae, are you okay?

363
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,070
- Aigoo!
- What the heck is this?

364
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,090
Don't ever show yourself again.

365
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,800
If you show yourself again...

366
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,900
I'm going to kick you right in your face!

367

Gosh, Young Shim must be crazy!

385
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,560
Oh Young Shim, wake up.

386
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,470
Hey, Oh Young Shim, are you really not going to work?

387
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,140
I'm not. I can't because I'm embarrassed.

388
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,460
Aigoo, hey!

389
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,310
Do you know what's really embarrassing?

390
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,550
Throwing someone down to the ground because you're mad and can't behave yourself.

391
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,940
That's what's really embarrassing, you brat!

392
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,220
I finally get to sleep in! What's your deal?

393
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,640
Let me at least sleep as much as I want.

394
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,740
I'm not eating. I'm not!

395
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,680
Don't f***ing eat, you bitch! Really!

396
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,010
Gosh! What a pain.

397
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,370
Get out, get out!

398
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,710
- Is Young Shim not eating?
- No.

399
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,880
Even if she says she wants to, I'm not letting her.

400
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,090
She got all mad and got all riled up that I woke her up.

401
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm sure Young Shim couldn't get a good sleep after what happened yesterday.

402
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,090
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

403
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,890
The one who beat him up got a goodnight's sleep.

404
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,490
She was snoring, too.

405
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,530

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,680
How is it?

529
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,000
I told Kingvely everything yesterday already.

530
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,050
<i>Also, the new variety show we'll be doing together...</i>

531
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,390
<i>Worried, my foot!</i>

532
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,680
<i>Just die!</i>

533
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,250
<i>Tap, tap- Tap!</i>

534
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,980
<i>That was why he came?</i>

535
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,770
Gosh, but there's a problem now.

536
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,120
I was sure Kingvely would join even until yesterday.

537
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,020
But he suddenly texted me, saying he won't do it.

538
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't want to work with that punk, either.

539
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,900
That's not right.

540
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,650
You should, even if you don't want to.

541
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,420
We need Wang Kyung Tae in order to save you and the show.

542
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,000
What's Wang Kyung Tae worth?

543
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,770
Is he really that big of a thing?

544
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,200
CEO Wang?

545
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,590
He's the hottest and coolest young and rich in Korea right now.

546
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,030
Cool, my foot.

547
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,190
Wh-Who are you saying is cool?

548
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,970
Hey, just listen to how cool he is.

549
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,740
His condition for joining the show was to have you in charge.

550
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,660
Well...

551
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,290
That's not true.

552
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,770
I don't know what he's scheming, but I'm too afraid to work with him.

553
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,460
Aigoo.

554
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,360
Let's just say he is scheming something.

555
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,250
Why does that matter?

556
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,850
Oh Young Shim, what are your priorities as a PD?

557
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,630
This is your last chance!

558
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,060
Look at your colleagues.

559
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,690
Each one makes a hit, moves to a new position, and makes another daebak there!

560
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,610
Don't you feel anything?

561
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,250
Young Shim...

562
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,740
To get what you really want, you need to give up your pride a little...

563
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,920
and learn to kill your temper.

564
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,450
So...

565
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,860
go and convince Kingvely to come back.

566
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,260
Gosh...

567
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,250
how can I work with Wang Kyung Tae?

568
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,970
I'm going to make this one a real hit.

569
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,450
I'll do my best, make sure to get recognized for my work...

570
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:27,700
and help you confidently draw successful Young Shim again, Dad.

571
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,200
All right. Thank you.

572
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,830
Fine, then! I'll join him.

573
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,900
What do I need to do first?

574
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,940
Yes, that's the spirit.

575
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,570
One second.

576
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,130
Hey.

577
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,110
What?

578
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,050
Hey, Oh Young Shim...

579
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,260
Yes.

580
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,820

<i>A favor?</i>

589

590
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,450
<i>All right.</i>

00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,870
<i>What is it?</i>

593
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,170
<i>During the final selections, pick me.</i>

What the heck is this?

595
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,530
You know anything about this?

596
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,970
I don't know, either.

597
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,810
So this means...

598
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,180
they colluded with each other, right?

599
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,400
Why are you asking me that?

600
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,430
Gosh, who the heck posted this online?

601
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,450
The news articles are up and

602
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,620
our website's bulletin board is filling up with complaints.

603
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,480
I'll...

604
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,750
I'll go and look into this.

605
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,170
Ow.

606
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,410
My handsome face without a single speck of flaw...

607
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,480
Oh Young Shim!

608
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,690
No, no.

609
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,960
Stop it. Relax.

610
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,620
Calm down.

611
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,250
How did she come out like that then and there?

612
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,360
Oh Young Shim really is unpredictable.

613
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,960
I shouldn't have gone there in the first place!

614
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,090
Come in.

615
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,100
CEO Wang, we're in deep trouble.

616
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,100
What is the fuss? What's the matter?

617
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,930
Did our new product get a crazy number of pre-orders?

618
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,950
That's not it.

619
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,420
Please listen to this.

["Love Lines" Rigging Controversy]
What's this?

621
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,650
It was uploaded anonymously just now

622
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,010
and it's spreading like wildfire on SNS and YouTube.

623
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,080
There are news articles about it, too.

624
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,380
Something's not right about this, right?

625
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,900
Wait...

626
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,120
Who on Earth posted this?

627
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,650
Should we prepare counter-news articles?

628
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,040
No...

629
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,510
Let's just watch the situation for now.

630
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,610
We can do that, CEO Wang, but...

631
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,140
the direct attack on Kingvely is too much.

632
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,750
<i>I enjoyed the show, but they cheated on us?</i>

633
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,490
<i>Do they still make shows this way?</i>

634
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,500
<i>Wang Kyung Tae is the biggest loser of all time.</i>

00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,790
<i>I'm dropping Kingvely.</i>

636
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,750
<i>What a liar. He's the worst.</i>

637
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,960
<i>I'm done with him as of today.</i>

638
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,270
The aftereffect is greater than expected.

639
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,220
The preference toward Kingvely and the number of new users rose after the broadcast...

640
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,340
are plummeting right after the controversy.

641
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,800
Even the existing users deleted their accounts? Does this make sense?

642
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,570
Including overall sales...

643
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,320
especially our company's PB products' sale rates...

644
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,050
recorded its historical lowest today.

645
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,960
This quarter will be difficult because we've got a lot of

646
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,780
order cancellations and refund requests.

647
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,210
We have a start-up investment company audit and an IPO coming up...

648
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,930
This is tough...

649
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,920
Wait...

650
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,730
Are you sure there's no other reason?

651
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,220
No.

652
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,450
The data doesn't lie.

653
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,650
That's what you said, CEO Wang.

654
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,590
It's because Kingvely's image is still directly related to that of its CEO.

655
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,830
It could be a betrayal of Kingvely's reputation of honesty and smartness you boasted.

656
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,250
With the rise of hostility,

657
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,730
I'm wondering if you shouldn't have gone on the show.

658
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,540
Okay!

659
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,650
What's okay, CEO Wang? Is there a way?

660
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,740
We must pull a head-on breakthrough.

661
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,140
I'll go and resolve the controversy I created.

662
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,850
A head-on breakthrough...

663
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,760
Wol Suk, what do we do about the controversy?

664
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,850
Did you see the hate comments?

665
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,160
Of course, I did.

666
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,880
What if your reputation becomes tarnished?

667
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,330
Do you want to at least release clarification?

668
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,120
There's no need to clarify anything. You should enjoy this, too.

669
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,650
What?

670
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,790
Hate comments over no comments.

671
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,000
Hate comments equal attention.

672
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,320
Look. My number of subscribers doubled in just one day.

673
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,680
Dating and love are all business in the end.

674
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,070

675
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,090
How incredible of you.

676
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:48,910
Is this the sincere program you spoke of?

677
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,320
I'll find the leaker, no matter what.

678
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,980
No, no.

679
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,130
That's no longer important.

680
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,500
Why?

681
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,450
Since people only focus on the controversy itself.

682
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,750
I'll do whatever I can.

683
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,820
Whoa, back to position, back to position.

684
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,150
No.

685
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,970
Don't do anything from now on.

686
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:18,250
The only thing for you to do now is to write a letter of apology.

687
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,930
- Chief Heo-
- Oh, oh!

688
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,100
There's one more thing.

689
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,220
They're shooting a documentary on deserted islands,

690
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,250
so go join that team.

691
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,620
Islands?

692
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,860
I'll be trapped there for six months, then.

693
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,300
Gosh, Sunbae, are you really trying to exile me?

694
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,010
Islands, how nice are they?

695
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,400
You need to take a break.

696
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
Wait, I really think there's a misunderstanding this time.

697
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,400
I'll really take care of this one, just for once.

698
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,130
Aigoo, let's stop this, Young Shim.

699
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,520
Please help me out. I'll really resolve this. Give me one last chance, please?

700
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,160
There's nothing I can do anymore, either.

701
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,210
Gosh, I just need to find it.

702
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,850
Right? Please-

703
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,780
Well...

704
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,100
Oh, well, CEO Wang, what brings you here?

705
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,540
I'll join the new variety show.

706
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,810
Aigoo, seriously.

707
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,370
How unfortunate.

708
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,080
I think the situation changed a lot.

709
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm disappointed, CEO Wang.

710
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,280
We need to resolve the issue right now, not start a new show.

711
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,400
We can do both.

712
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,230
Resolving the issue and starting a new show.

713
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,100
How so?

714
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,890
We need to break through head-on.

715
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:52,370
Also, Kingvely will sponsor the entire production cost for the new show.

716
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,770
<i>The entire production cost?</i>

717
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,720
Not a bad deal for you, right?

718
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,210
I mean, well...

719
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,300
Even if production cost is taken care of...

720
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,230
How are you going to break through the controversy?

721
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:20,420
I'll apologize honestly for causing a problem with my feelings in the past

722
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,590
and create a genuine and sincere dating show with PD Oh Young Shim.

723
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,690
You and I?

724
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,410
We're going to get along...

725
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,900
right?

726
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:53,020
♫ <i>When you're asleep, I stay up all night, every night</i> ♫

727
00:43:53,020 --> 00:44:01,020
♫ <i>Even if I close my heart's eyes that think of you, I still see you</i> ♫

728
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,270
[Oh! Youngsim]

729
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,010
<i>Hey, how are you going to do this?</i>

730
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,160
<i>Bring me an idea in three days.</i>

731
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,580
<i>Wh-Who do you think you are? You think you're the chief or something?</i>

732
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,300
<i>I'm your lifeline, the key to PD Oh's survival in the variety show department.</i>

733
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,270
<i>Am I not?</i>

734
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,680
<i>Must we work with that guy Wang Kyung Tae?</i>

735
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,460
<i>Kyung Tae oppa coming back after 20 years, is it really a coincidence?</i>

736
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,300
<i>How purely honest do you think a person can be?</i>

737
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,500
<i>Shall we test it out right now?</i>

738
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,930
<i>How honest one can become?</i>

739
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,410
<i>In my opinion...</i>

740
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,450
<i>we're wishing for the same thing.</i>

741
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,960
<i>Shall we...</i>

742
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,580
<i>Watch out!</i>

743
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,450
<i>Wh-What's going on?</i>

744
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,350
<i>I can't let her go like this!</i>

745
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,120
♫ <i>Without hesitating</i> ♫
