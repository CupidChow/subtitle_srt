(Song Ha Yoon as the Young Sim we all know)

(Lee Dong Hae as the nerd Wang Kyung Tae)

(Jung Woo Yeon as Gu Wol Sook)

(Ga Young as Soon Sim, and Song Young Jae as Dae Kwang)

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,938
(Cho Yu Ha as Ji Yu, Tony An as Lee Woo Sang,)

7
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,979
(and Wang Ji Hye as Jin Sim)

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,920
(Oh! YoungSim)

9
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,590
Can you edit out everything that happened today?

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,218
Well, actually, I was thinking about what to do.

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,929
Don't think about it. Just delete everything.

12
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,569
This is worse than just hitting on a random girl...

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,630
on a street and getting slapped.

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,269
It's more humiliating than that. You saw it too.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,709
Ki Ho.

16
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,780
I truly understand what you're going through.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,079
My feelings were completely disregarded.

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,090
Yet, you want to air those clips on TV?

19
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,260
Ki Ho. But...

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,599
this is more than just a TV show.

21
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,599
I think this is Yeo Ul's answer to your feelings.

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,109
Everything we recorded today...

23
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,840
is her story as much as it is yours, Ki Ho.

24
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,950
I don't think I'll ever be able to find love...

25
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,120
because of what happened today!

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,750
But...

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,259
you want to record this day with videos that will last forever?

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,189
No! I can't let that happen.

29
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,299
I understand. You should...

30
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,199
try to calm down right now.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,299
- Delete that. - I...

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,030
Ki Ho, have you forgotten?

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,439
We talked about never giving up...

34
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,909
no matter whatever obstacles...

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,080
came your way.

36
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,349
Do you think you could say the same thing if you were in my shoes?

37
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,288
No, Ki Ho! You can't do that.

38
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,750
What are you doing?

39
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,389
- Give it back! No! You can't! - Producer Oh.

40
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,689
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

41
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,759
- Tell them I did it. Okay? - No.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,030
No, Ki Ho! You can't do that!

43
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,999
Ki Ho! No!

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,439
No. Ki Ho!

45
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,270
Hold on. Ki Ho.

46
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,770
Ki Ho, open the door.

47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,378
You can't do this.

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,210
Please be reasonable.

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,580
Ki Ho. Give me another chance at editing them. Please.

50
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,319
Once time passes by,

51
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,289
you'll forget about this and move on.

52
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,759
I'll take care of this.

53
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,228
No!

54
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,029
Don't do it, Ki Ho!

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,698
Ki Ho!

56
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:13,629
Ki Ho, wait!

57
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,770
(Episode 8: Even a Humiliating Past Is Still My Past)

58
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,479
Kyung Tae, where are you going?

59
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,020
I think Young Sim has my watch.

60
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,180
Then you can locate her, right?

61
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,729
I think I can get her approximate location.

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,959
I'll head out now.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,259
- Okay. - I'll go with you.

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,409
What are you doing?

65
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,810
I was going to look at the map to check the location.

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,750
You should focus on driving.

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,620
Fasten your seatbelt first.

68
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,670
What's wrong with you?

69
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,209
I can't stop thinking that this could end badly.

70
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,410
What if someone happened to her?

71
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,050
It's not the time to cry right now.

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,179
If you keep crying, I'll leave you here!

73
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,948
No! I'll go with you.

74
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,660
I'll be quiet and won't do anything.

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,790
Look at the map and check the location.

76
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,999
Drive safely.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,029
Go straight.

78
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,370
You have to get my sister back!

79
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,339
Gosh. Oh, no.

80
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:04,610
This is crazy.

81
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,778
- Ki Ho. Stop the car. - Gosh!

82
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,148
When did you get in?

83
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,278
Stop the car.

84
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,220
Pull over. Let's calm down and talk about this. Please?

85
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,119
Why are you doing this to me? Just leave me alone.

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,620
I'm begging you. Please give me back my laptop.

87
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:21,688
I just need you to get out of the van.

88
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,860
I can't give this to you.

89
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,899
I can't get out of the van, either.

90
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,958
- I can't get out of the van... - What? Come on.

91
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,230
until I get my laptop back.

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Gosh, come on. What are you doing?

93
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,339
I should be saying that to you. What is this? Stop the car now!

94
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,649
Stop shaking your legs! I can't focus. Darn it.

95
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,289
Hey, step on it. Why are you driving so slowly?

96
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,459
Step on it now!

97
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm going as fast as I can.

98
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,699
Liar.

99
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,268
We're getting farther away. What are you doing?

100
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,639
Come on. Step on it. Seriously.

101
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,180
You don't know the way around here.

102
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,850
- Stop it. - Pull over now.

103
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,410
Come on. Give back my laptop!

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,649
Gosh.

105
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,989
- You're going to cause an accident! - Give it back!

106
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,850
- Stop it. Gosh. - Give it back!

107
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,128
Turn the corner. Hurry.

108
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,628
Do you see the white car over there?

109
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,599
Drive past that car quickly. Hurry! Faster!

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,730
Be quiet! You can't even drive.

111
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,540
Step on it!

112
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:52,879
Ki Ho!

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Ki Ho!

114
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,360
Ki Ho!

115
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,669
Hold on! Don't do that.

116
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,100
No!

117
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,000
Hold on a second.

118
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,939
No. Wait.

119
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,009
Let's talk it out. Calm down. Hold on.

120
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,089
Wait up!

121
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,329
But this is the only way.

123
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,360
- No! Hold on! - I...

124
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,628
Don't you know what this footage means?

125
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,670
I do!

126
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,339
This is the footage of my humiliating moments.

127
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,040
This footage has all of my humiliating moments.

128
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,479
- I'll throw them away. - Don't do it. No.

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,508
- No! You can't! - Let go of me!

130
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,549
- Young Sim! - Young Sim!

131
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,619
Darn it. Gosh.

132
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,649
Wake up.

133
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
Kyung Tae.

134
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,019
I told you not to stop me.

135
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,970
Can you put her in my car?

136
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:15,670
Okay.

137
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,839
Ki Ho, put that down.

138
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,879
Don't come close.

139
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,220
Do you think you can get rid of your humiliating moments like this?

140
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,350
Mind your own business!

141
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,659
I'm asking if you can stop being a loser with that.

142
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,529
Give it back.

143
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,789
Please?

144
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,429
Producer Oh...

145
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,870
worked on that day and night...

146
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,370
and didn't go to sleep for days to make that program.

147
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,509
"Days?"

148
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,840
Seven years.

149
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,950
I had feelings for Yeo Ul for seven years.

150
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,519
My seven years didn't mean anything and went to waste.

151
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,620
How could you say that to me?

152
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,220
All this only after seven years?

153
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,190
Don't act like your world collapsed only after seven years!

154
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,429
What?

155
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,529
It's been 20 years for some people.

156
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,740
Twenty years?

157
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,309
Do you know why...

158
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,308
I decided to take your case...

159
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,509
even though you didn't meet many of the standards?

160
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,850
Because I saw myself in you.

161
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,620
Don't make stuff up just to talk me out of this.

162
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,559
A sense of despair comes from never getting your feelings reciprocated.

163
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,899
Then your pride hits the ground so hard.

164
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,730
So you're only left with spite...

165
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,169
which turns you into a loser.

166
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,700
I know how that feels better than anyone.

167
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,240
I know how you feel better than anyone.

168
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,480
If you throw that away,

169
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,039
you will forever be a loser.

170
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,580
Is that what you want?

171
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,480
I told you I could help you,

172
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,120
but you must accept your defeat. Don't you agree?

173
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,490
Why are you calling that defeat?

174
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,470
All that matters is how you feel.

175
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,169
How is that considered a defeat or a waste of time?

176
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,240
You don't own...

177
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,110
her heart.

178
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,950
It's up to her to decide...

179
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,620
what to do with her feelings.

180
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,129
Why are you butting in all of a sudden?

181
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,730
Your feelings...

182
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,029
have to mean something too.

183
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,538
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

184
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,210
Of all people, you can't say that.

185
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,379
You're so mean, Mr. Wang.

186
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,820
I mean...

187
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,620
Do I need your permission to cry for getting dumped?

188
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,850
You got dumped?

189
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,019
Yes. I got dumped.

190
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,629
By Young Sim.

191
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,399
Hurry up.

192
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,940
I like you, Young Sim.

193
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,639
What?

194
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,870
My wish is...

195
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,909
for you to like me back.

196
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,580
Stop joking around.

197
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,690
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:35,690
Well, I slipped.

199
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,289
I'll head down first.

200
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,230
- Young Sim. - Yes.

201
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,269
You heard my wish, right?

202
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,200
How is that a wish?

203
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,039
You will grant my wish, right?

204
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,159
Chae Dong, make another wish.

205
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,000
I know how much you respect me...

206
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,769
and like me.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,029
But...

208
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,009
make another wish.

209
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,809
Why?

210
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,659
It's getting chilly, right?

211
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,139
Come down when you're ready. I'll head down first.

212
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,610
Just like that,

213
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,019
she turned me down so fast before I could say anything!

214
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,559
But still.

215
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,128
- You have it better than me. - How is that better?

216
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,899
I never got to go on a date with her!

217
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,469
It's better to get dumped in private...

218
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,029
than going on an embarrassing date on national TV.

219
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:28,009
I don't even have anyone to blame.

220
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,139
I have to see her every day...

221
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,409
at work even after getting dumped.

222
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,580
I can't see her even if I miss her.

223
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,590
You're still young.

224
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,460
Young, my foot.

225
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,830
That's not comforting at all, Ki Ho.

226
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,360
Gosh.

227
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,399
I know how that feels.

228
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,970
Ki Ho.

229
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,639
I know how you feel too.

230
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,940
It's all because of him.

231
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,879
He's an awful guy.

232
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,820
Don't cry.

233
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,919
He's to blame. It's all his fault.

234
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,990
Ki Ho, don't cry.

235
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,169
Don't cry. We shouldn't cry.

236
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:46,909
Gosh, Young Sim.

237
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,480
You should have been more careful.

238
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,640
Where are we?

239
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,410
What?

240
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:28,579
The broadcast station.

241
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:32,819
What?

242
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:35,950
The station?

243
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,189
Ki Ho? Wait!

244
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,190
Ki Ho! Stop! Just a moment!

245
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,029
- We'll get hurt! Stop it! - Give me the laptop!

246
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,169
- No. Stop. You can't! - Just let go of me!

247
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,230
- Young Sim! - Young Sim!

248
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:53,940
What happened?

249
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,868
How did we get here?

250
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,809
I definitely remember being with Ki Ho.

251
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,140
You remember that?

252
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,849
Yes.

253
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,509
And then you came...

254
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,579
I don't remember after that.

255
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,249
The laptop! Where is Ki Ho?

256
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,759
Are the laptop and Ki Ho okay?

257
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,720
Tell me they didn't fall into the water together.

258
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,960
Here.

259
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,069
The laptop! Thank goodness!

260
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,439
Kyung Tae! This is such a relief!

261
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,008
The laptop survived!

262
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,039
Get off me.

263
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,509
Oh, my.

264
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,440
How did you get this back?

265
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,880
I'll explain later.

266
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:36,849
Aren't you late?

267
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,880
What? Gosh. I am late.

268
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,089
This is yours.

269
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,900
- You should hurry along. - Right.

270
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,500
And be careful!

271
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Yes, that's right.

272
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,359
- Let's get going. - In that case, I will...

273
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,299
Gosh. My back hurts.

274
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,569
Are you okay, Ki Ho?

275
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,250
What on earth? When did that happen?

276
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,589
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

277
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,788
- Ki Ho? - I've decided to accept...

278
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,119
that even bad experiences are mine to cherish.

279
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,990
Please be kind with the editing.

280
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,099
Thank you, Ki Ho.

281
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,529
I'll do my best with the editing.

282
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:13,940
Just a moment.

283
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,880
I want to do something for Ki Ho too.

284
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,279
I can't let this be the end for our first participant.

285
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:25,019
We have some time before the next story, so...

286
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,029
Let's see here.

287
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,858
(I've had a crush on my colleague for a long time.)

288
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:32,758
(I have a colleague who was also employed when I was.)

289
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,630
(Her name is Jung Yeo Ul.)

290
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,369
All I ever did was work.

291
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,539
There was no particular reason.

292
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,839
I just fell for her because it was her.

293
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,880
I really don't want...

294
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,079
to give up on her.

295
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,349
I had such high hopes that it would all go well.

296
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:04,490
Ki Ho, you didn't expect this either, did you?

297
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,000
(Comments)

298
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,500
What?

299
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,069
Ki Ho, I'm so jealous of the woman in your story.

300
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,170
You're innocent and unwavering, and my ideal type.

301
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,640
Please contact me if you happen to get rejected.

302
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,279
"Please contact me?"

303
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,650
What is this?

304
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,990
What should I do?

305
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,589
(Please write your reply here.)

306
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,598
(Hello. I'm the producer, Oh Young Sim.)

307
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,200
(Would you be interested in a blind date with cameras?)

308
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,099
- Ki Ho? - You're here. Hello.

309
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,680
Gosh. You look incredible today.

310
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,450
You've come a long way to put this together yourself.

311
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,250
Right. You know, they say life teaches you...

312
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,650
the most valuable lessons through heartbreak.

313
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,059
Show the world that unrequited love isn't hopeless,

314
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,089
but an opportunity. All right?

315
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
All right.

316
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,430
By the way, Mr. Wang,

317
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,000
how is your 20-year crush going?

318
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,670
Excuse me.

319
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,309
Yes, Soon Sim?

320
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,410
Mr. Wang, you need to come into the office to confirm something.

321
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,579
Just a moment.

322
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,450
You should head inside. I'll be there soon.

323
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,619
Okay.

324
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,319
Keep talking.

325
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,799
Hello. I'm Yang Da Mi.

326
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,369
You look more handsome in person.

327
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:57,670
My gosh. You flatter me, Da Mi.

328
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,579
You take your jokes too far.

329
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,579
Please, eat up.

330
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,819
- Look, there are oranges. - Do you like oranges?

331
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,190
Yes. It's been such a long time since I've eaten oranges.

332
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,930
We did something right.

333
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,369
My gosh.

334
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,980
From now on, Da Mi, you should...

335
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,279
This looks promising.

336
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,359
Hello, Ms. Oh. It's Yoo Ho Jae.

337
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,630
Do you remember me?

338
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,759
Of course, Ho Jae. Have you been well?

339
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,328
- I thought of you so I reached out. - They're doing well.

340
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,299
(I thought of you and decided to reach out.)

341
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,900
- Thinking of me? - He's saying the right things too.

342
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,069
I'm stepping out for a moment.

343
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,319
Gosh.

344
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,119
Things are running smoothly.

345
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,390
They suit each other well too.

346
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,500
Are you going somewhere, Young Sim?

347
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,529
I brought a gift for Ki Ho, so I'm going to get it from my car.

348
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,829
Right. I see.

349
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,869
- By the way, Young Sim, - Yes?

350
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,509
where did you park your car?

351
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Why?

352
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,539
I'll carry the gift for you.

353
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,980
- It's fine. I'll do it. - No.

354
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,349
I'll do it.

355
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,750
Young Sim,

356
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,589
I know we can't go back to as close as we were.

357
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,730
But I'm still a junior employee that likes you and learns from you.

358
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,339
All right. Thanks, Chae Dong.

359
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,019
I'm home.

360
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,849
- You're home. - Yes.

361
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,259
Ji Yu, would you clean your aunts' room in my place?

362
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,130
Me? Where are the aunts?

363
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,829
They're both very busy and barely home these days.

364
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,369
That's right. It's too much for the two of us to do everything.

365
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:42,339
My gosh. My back. Why does it hurt so much?

366
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,279
Ask your aunts for pocket money when you're done cleaning.

367
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,710
I'll leave it to you.

368
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,420
What was that?

369
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,730
It's so messy.

370
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,000
Gosh.

371
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,170
What is this?

372
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,058
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable.

373
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:40,329
- Please leave a message. - Then...

374
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,379
Yes, Ji Yu. What is it?

375
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,720
Make it quick. I'm busy.

376
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,190
I cleaned your room. Give me an allowance.

377
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,750
"An allowance?"

378
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,619
You didn't have to clean it.

379
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,220
I already did.

380
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,160
It's Young Sim who messes it up.

381
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,930
I only sleep there.

382
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,430
You should ask Young Sim to pay you.

383
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,500
She won't pick up her phone.

384
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:21,000
Right.

385
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,809
She told me she ran out of money this month.

386
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,039
Is this what people call overdue payment?

387
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,180
I hear I should go to the workplace of the one who owes to make a scene.

388
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,818
Just sell something she doesn't use...

389
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:35,920
and use it as your allowance.

390
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,390
She has a lot of stuff piled up, but she doesn't use them.

391
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,720
I got your back.

392
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,660
I have to go. Bye.

393
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,980
Come in.

394
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,729
Per your request, I brought last quarter's sales figures...

395
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,230
and last year's audit documents.

396
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,369
Thank you.

397
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,220
Kyung Tae.

398
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,420
What?

399
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,990
There isn't anything bothering you, is there?

400
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,089
Don't worry.

401
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,430
Also, don't work overtime again.

402
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,299
You should go home on time.

403
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,299
I will. You too.

404
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
Good luck.

405
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,149
This is going to get ugly.

406
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,849
You should look into this matter now.

407
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,058
If you don't come back by the 19th,

408
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,689
I have no choice but to turn the matter over...

409
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,430
to the Star Company's lawyers.

410
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,660
Call me, and please come back. Min Kim.

411
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,039
(Send)

412
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,710
(Email sent)

413
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,029
She usually comes out around this time.

414
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,700
What's taking her so long?

415
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,009
You startled me. What are you doing?

416
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:18,579
I was just stretching.

417
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,819
Stretching.

418
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,220
"Stretching?" Here?

419
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:26,319
Yes, I often stretch before driving.

420
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,160
Like so. You know?

421
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,390
I see.

422
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,759
It looks like we're going in the same direction.

423
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:37,670
If you want, you can get in.

424
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,009
All right.

425
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,609
Get in.

426
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,220
Next applicant, please come in.

427
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,489
("Love Mark")

428
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,859
- Hello. - Hello.

429
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,359
Please introduce yourself.

430
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,500
I'm a junior at Manna High School. My name is Kim Min Ji.

431
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,599
Can you tell us more about the story you sent us?

432
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,008
I went to elementary school, middle school, and high school...

433
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:22,849
with this one guy named Woo Chan.

434
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,180
We live in the same neighbourhood, and he follows me around.

435
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,289
Or more like he used to.

436
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,368
(Rasung Villa 1)

437
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,400
Min Ji,

438
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,400
let's go to school together.

439
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,470
I told you to stop bothering me.

440
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,250
Min Ji, wait for me.

441
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:01,818
But it's starting soon.

442
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,419
Exactly. But we're so hungry.

443
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,558
- Seriously. - What's wrong with them?

444
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,589
Min Ji.

445
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,230
Do you want to get some tteokbokki?

446
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,799
Why would I eat tteokbokki with you?

447
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:18,170
There's a new tteokbokki place in front of the school.

448
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,240
Their half-price sale ends today.

449
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,069
Really?

450
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,779
Gosh. But that means it'll be crowded.

451
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,009
I hate lining up.

452
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,420
Should I stand in line for you?

453
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,430
- You can come in now. - Okay.

454
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,630
Min Ji, over here.

455
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,299
Are you next?

456
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:53,900
How many of you are there?

457
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,170
There are five.

458
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,839
Really? Goodness.

459
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,679
Our store is really small.

460
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,750
The maximum I can allow is four. What should we do?

461
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,079
I'll...

462
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,519
I'll eat next time.

463
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:12,889
Let's go in.

464
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,599
He's always chasing you around. Maybe you should date him.

465
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,699
Are you crazy? Why would I date him?

466
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,969
Why not? He's so loyal to you.

467
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,269
You should date him.

468
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:36,349
No...

469
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,750
This is really delicious.

470
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,099
Do you have a wish? Tell me one.

471
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,670
- Really? - Yes.

472
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,869
Actually, my birthday is next week.

473
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,940
Do you want to go to an amusement park?

474
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,110
All right. If I'm free.

475
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,359
But he didn't contact me for days.

476
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,760
I even visited his house...

477
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,630
and found out he went abroad to study during the winter break.

478
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,059
He went abroad to study?

479
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,699
We met again after a year.

480
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,570
(Manna High School)

481
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:46,379
- It's Woo Chan. He's so handsome. - No way.

482
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,719
Kang Woo Chan! Hurry up.

483
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,690
- "Kang Woo Chan?" - Min Ji, isn't that him?

484
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,329
He was the one who used to chase you around.

485
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,860
Hey, Kang Woo Chan!

486
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,679
Ever since then, he treats me like I'm invisible.

487
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:18,250
He doesn't even say hello.

488
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,420
Let's go!

489
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,329
You went to middle school with Woo Chan, right?

490
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:39,869
Yes.

491
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:41,400
Can you pass this on to him?

492
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:44,570
What is that?

493
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,920
Did you say Kim Min Ji signed up for this show?

494
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,730
Why?

495
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,530
This might take you by surprise,

496
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:16,610
but Min Ji wants to start over with you again.

497
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,480
What a big dream she has.

498
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,590
They're young, but their story is relatable.

499
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,159
They're innocent too.

500
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:38,329
She doesn't think he's good enough for her,

501
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,730
but she doesn't want to give him away, either.

502
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,000
A young girl brought up her courage to apply.

503
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,638
I think it's a common situation...

504
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,010
that could happen to any young person.

505
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,769
"Common?"

506
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,079
It never happened to me.

507
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,919
I think we can take a cute and innocent approach...

508
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,449
to this story.

509
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,150
"Cute and innocent?"

510
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,219
We're thinking of putting them on a double date.

511
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,159
- "A double date?" - "A double date?"

512
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:11,929
Who will go on the date with them from this room?

513
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,760
Well, it's a given.

514
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,768
The concept of our show focuses on...

515
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,769
Young Sim and Kyung Tae from the past.

516
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,440
I don't think it's necessary to push for that.

517
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,709
If I join them on the date, I can coach them...

518
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,380
and make it more fun.

519
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,920
Are you going to just sit there?

520
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,289
Say something.

521
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,018
Then Wol Sook and Mr. Wang can go together,

522
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,230
and Young Sim and Chae Dong can go too.

523
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,000
I'll stay out this time.

524
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,900
I have to look after some equipment.

525
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,170
I'll excuse myself.

526
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,639
Where are you going?

527
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,578
Then let's stick to the original plan...

528
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,750
and have Mr. Wang and Young Sim go with them.

529
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,650
Are we okay with that?

530
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,289
Kyung Tae, aren't you busy?

531
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,690
Don't you have to get your company listed?

532
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,260
Kyung Tae is busy.

533
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,619
Let's leave the others to it.

534
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,989
I'll do it.

535
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,260
It's work.

536
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,170
Really?

537
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,570
Gosh. Are you finally enthusiastic about "Love Mark?"

538
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,690
Chae Dong!

539
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,159
Chae Dong, hurry up.

540
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,759
Chae Dong, didn't you see me trying to set things up?

541
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,000
Why did you suddenly say you didn't want to be in it?

542
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,800
Did you forget about our partnership?

543
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,070
Gosh.

544
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,769
I gave up...

545
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,539
on Young Sim.

546
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,579
You gave up? Why?

547
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,510
She has someone in her heart,

548
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,349
so she can't accept my feelings.

549
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,019
That's no reason to give up.

550
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,989
She looked sincere.

551
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,360
- Young Sim. - Yes?

552
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,429
You heard my wish, right?

553
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,239
Chae Dong.

554
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,409
I know how much you respect me...

555
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,210
and like me.

556
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,449
But...

557
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,489
make a different wish.

558
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,488
If you were going to give up so easily,

559
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,889
why did you like her for so long?

560
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,260
Don't you feel wronged?

561
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,670
I'll help you, okay?

562
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,599
I respect...

563
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,670
her opinion.

564
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,949
This is the way...

565
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,820
I express my love for her.

566
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,500
- Gosh. What do I do? - Goodness.

567
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,268
Ki Ho found...

568
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:38,670
a new love.

569
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,698
(Ki Ho found a new love.)

570
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,099
(Life is so unpredictable, isn't it?)

571
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,010
That sounds smooth.

572
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,779
It would be nice if we could Photoshop...

573
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,820
a picture of them together in front of the wishing rock.

574
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,820
Let's see...

575
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,150
What?

576
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,420
What is this?

577
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,289
When did they take this?

578
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,269
So this is the wishing rock, is it?

579
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,809
A rock that grants wishes...

580
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,619
My wish is for Young Sim's...

581
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:39,659
I wonder why we were like that.

582
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,299
As if we were under a spell that kills us...

583
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,429
for saying the truth,

584
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,039
we were never honest.

585
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:49,769
Not until...

586
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,039
that happened.

587
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,860
(Oh! YoungSim)

588
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,928
I never said I wanted tteokbokki.

589
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,599
Why is a man acting so stingy?

590
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,328
I don't want to do this anymore.

591
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,969
He's going to apologize.

592
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,309
I heard you almost kissed Kyung Tae while eating.

593
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,269
Was it another joke?

594
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,480
You amaze me.

595
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:03,309
How can you sleep so deeply in a situation like this?

596
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,050
Min Ji!

597
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,820
She left on her own will. Why are you looking for her?

598
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,118
Why are you so bitter?

599
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:12,860
Forget it. I won't ask for your help again.

600
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:14,920
I think I know how you feel.

601
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,130
It happened to you before, didn't it?

602
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:18,960
Me?

603
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,400
Didn't you read this?

604
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,630
("YoungSim")

605
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,329
Gosh.

606
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:28,340
Will Kyung Tae finally leave this place now?

607
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,710
That's good news.

608
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:31,969
Did they already finish the check-up and everything?

609
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,380
With this outfit, you're sure to win your date over.

610
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,579
Did Young Sim really do that?

611
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,150
Why didn't she tell me?
