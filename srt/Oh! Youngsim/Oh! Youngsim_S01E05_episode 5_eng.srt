1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,650

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,380

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,370

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,940

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,450

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,150

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:45,390

8
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:54,950

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,270
Is no one home?

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,350
Man, it's hot.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,080
Gosh, this hurts my pride, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,870
No, I can do much worse than this!

13
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,520
Love is something you attain.

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,200
Huh? Chae Dong, what brings you here?

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,140
Hello. What brings you here, Wol Sook?

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,300
There's something I need to call dibs on.

17
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,790
Anyway, what brings you to your colleague's house at this hour?

18
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,410
Oh, I also have something to deliver to Senior, so I stopped by.

19
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,810
What do you need to deliver? I'll give it to her.

20
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,200
By chance, is it love?

21
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,960
You'll wake everyone up.

22
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,390
Did you say you're PD Chae Dong?

23
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:15,340
Mr. PD, are you aware your gaze and my gaze are the same right now?

24
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,140
In my opinion, we wish for the same thing.

25
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,270
Do you want to... form an alliance with me?

26
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,910
I can probably be of great help to you.

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,590
Why are you doing this?

28
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,320
Why are you scared?

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,590
Gosh, what are you doing?

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,690

31
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,180
 Flushed face,

32
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,190
 loose and disheveled front,

33
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,420
 and just the two of them at home, on top of that?

34
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,230
 Shaky eyes,

35
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,530
 hyperventilating,

36
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,550
 and why is her hair wet?

37
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,550
A-Aren't you going to drink your drinks?

38
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,510
Whoa... it's really hot today.

39
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,860
The ice is going to melt.

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,210
Wh-Whoa, S-Senior, what's wrong? Wh-Why?

41
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,510
I thought there was a bug.

42
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,000
There definitely is. Something happened.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,970
You can't fool my instincts.

44
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,940
I'm busy, so excuse me first.

45
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,770
Where do you think you're going? We didn't even get to the point.

46
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,350
What happened? I even heard someone scream.

47
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,940
What happened here?

48
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,580
Hey!

49
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,880
What the? Get away from me!

50
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,790
You get your hands off of my body!

51
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,180
What— Look the other way.

52
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,170
You could've gotten up already!

53
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,500
Hurry up! Look the other way and close your eyes.

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,080
Seriously, there's nothing to see.

55
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,120
Nothing to see? You saw?

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,890
You saw. You did. You definitely saw!

57
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,560
- You saw! You did! 
 - No, I didn't. I didn't see.

58
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,530
 Young Shim, are you upstairs?

59
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,480
- Why? 
 - Senior, I'm here.

60
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,380
Should I come up?

61
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,830
Hey, that's my sweater... That's mine.

62
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,080
Why did she wear my clothes?

63
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,670
Pink?

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,770
Yes, I'm coming!

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,410
Senior...

66
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,620
There's only one b-bathtub in our house.

67
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,790
So we were both fighting to wash first, and you guys came in.

68
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,060
Right?

69
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,440
Y-Yes.

70
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,570
S-She's r-right.

71
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,570
That scream was definitely when you see something you shouldn't have.

72
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,980
 As expected, Goo Wol Sook, you're keen.

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,040
Am I wrong?

74
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,660
You're wrong. What scream?

75
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,910
 Oh Young Shim, don't get played into this.

76
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,030
Well, anyhow, what brings the two of you to my house at this time?

77
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,630
Oh, me?

78
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,050
I came to cast my dear Kyeong Tae.

79
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,370
M-Me?

80
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,580
Wang Kyeong Tae's doing a show with me, though?

81
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,440
What? What's this about? What show?

82
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,260
The two of you? Together?

83
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,860
When? How can you do this without even telling me?

84
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,010
Chae Dong, is this true?

85
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,850
Yes. Huh?

86
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,590
What show is this?

87
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:27,080
Oh, well, it's a dating show.

88
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,360
They're on board together.

89
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,980
Whoa, you two are really disloyal.

90
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,000
Disloyal?

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,150
It's a business.

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
 What's this?

93
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,320
 What's this pounding of heart?

94
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,050
That business sounds like fun. Looks like I can be a part of it.

95
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,290
And who says?

96
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,270
I honestly have a part in how the show became an issue, and you got to have a second show.

97
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,530
In fact, I don't only have a part.

98
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,360
I was the one who made the decisive move.

99
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,500
You think it would've been possible without my achievement?

100
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,260
Is backstabbing someone an achievement?

101
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,930
Oh, my. What's this girl saying?

102
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,040
Such a thing is called suspense, not backstabbing, Young Shim.

103
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,400
Gosh, this is why all your shows and dating alike so far were so boring.

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,360
What?

105
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,530
Hey, Goo Wol Sook!

106
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,960
I just can't get through to you.

107
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,140
Kyeong Tae, it's okay. Right?

108
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,760
- Well, I'm— 
 - I'm sure it'll be a plus for you, too.

109
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,090
Since you're a businessman, don't you get it right away?

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,910
I'm sure Chae Dong is okay with it, too. Right?

111
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,120
Chae Dong... please tell that lady to stop saying unnecessary stuff.

112
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,960
Unnecessary stuff...

113
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,290
 Do you want to... form an alliance with me?

114
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,180
 I can probably be of great help to you.

115
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,980
Well, the thing is...

116
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,090
Where does this sound keep coming from, by the way?

117
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,910
Your alarm keeps ringing.

118
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,950
 Abnormal pulse. Warning. Your heart is racing.

119
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,950
Isn't it broken?

120
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,670
 There is nothing wrong with me.

121
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,400
Nope.

122
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,460
 State of excitement.

123
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,380
 Please relax your heart and take a deep breath.

124
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,240
Is this crazy? What's up with this? Why isn't it turning off?

125
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,990
- It is crazy. 
  - I don't want to turn off.

126
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,210
Do such human-like smartwatches exist?

127
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,950
Well, this is my company's smartwatch that's going to be launched.

128
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,480
Don't worry about it, and let's continue the conversation.

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,540
Oh, right.

130
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,090
We were in the middle of an important talk. Right?

131
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,900
Nope.

132
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,750
There's nothing more to discuss with you, Goo Wol Sook.

133
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,180
Your YouTube channel and broadcasting are two clearly different things.

134
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,870
What's so different?

135
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,540
I'm a YouTuber with a silver button for having 200,000 subscribers.

136
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,670
I know better than you about what people like and are interested in.

137
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,520
Including dating and content!

138
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,710
Kyeong Tae... didn't you say this show is important for you as well?

139
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,730
You need to hire an expert, then.

140
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,330
Gosh, what dating show is a bunch of dating failures going to make?

141
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,690
F-Failures, Wol Sook? You're speaking rather harshly!

142
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,000
Nowadays, dating is also a job field with a market.

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,330
Doing it only with an imagination without experts is something that amateurs do.

144
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,310
Who among you were in a relationship recently?

145
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,270
No one, right?

146
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,230
Have you seen dating shows without an expert in them?

147
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,260
You need various experiences and relatable advice

148
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,580
for the show to build trust and get spread by word of mouth.

149
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,060
If you have the marketing effect through my channel, it's the cherry on top.

150
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:46,330
Oh, if you try to cast the popular panels now, it'll take at least a few months.

151
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,130
If you really don't want to, forget it.

152
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,240
I'll disclose my know-how on my channel.

153
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,830
I'll take my leave since it looks like I'll be getting busy.

154
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,350
W-Wait a second!

155
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,210
One second.

156
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,130
A-All right, then.

157
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,160
L-Let's work together.

158
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,610
Instead, you'll absolutely not fake things like last time!

159
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,890
Why the sudden change of mind?

160
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,420
That's because... you're a dating expert.

161
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,500
I'm acknowledging you for that.

162
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,100
So let's work together.

163
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,940
I'm conflicted.

164
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,100
All right. Well, what are friends for?

165
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,820
I'll do that for you.

166
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,420
Okay...

167
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,600
Thanks.

168
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
 Senior, I'll be going now.

169
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,480
By the way, Kyeong Tae... will you continue to stay at Young Shim's house?

170
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,640
Why do you ask?

171
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,760
It looks uncomfortable with only one bathroom and all.

172
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,450
That's right. Having only one bathroom will be really inconvenient.

173
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,790
Should I look for a place that's way cozier and more convenient than this place,

174
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,790
with more than two bathrooms?

175
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,920
W-Will you?

176
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,400
What's all this ruckus in the middle of the night?

177
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,690
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

178
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,970
Wol Sook and Chae Dong are here, too. Did you hang out together?

179
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,030
But were the four of you close like this?

180
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,410
Does it feel good to eat delicious food without me?

181
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,410
You told us not to talk to you when you're on a break.

182
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,690
Oh, shoot! I forgot the bath bombs!

183
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,300
Oh... y-yes...

184
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,900
Wait, I had texted Kyeong Tae earlier since he didn't seem to be home.

185
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,760
Oh, yes. I saw your text.

186
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,180
But I had gone out to work out.

187
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,300
I see. Did you eat anything?

188
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,120
Take a shower and come down. I'll make you something delicious.

189
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,210
I-I'm going back inside now.

190
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,450
T-Take care.

191
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm going back inside, too.

192
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,300
Kyeong Tae, good night!

193
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,330
Senior, have a good night!

194
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,440
- Let's get inside. 
 - Yes.

195
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Please take care.

196
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,650
- Have a good night. 
 - Yes.

197
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,170
- See you. 
 - Yes, yes.

198
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,570
I'll come again next time!

199
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,870
It'll be good for your safety to forget anything you saw today.

200
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,850
That's my line.

201
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,380
Don't even touch the tip of my finger from now on.

202
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,990
Good god, that little!

203
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,000
As I expected, leaving those two together is too dangerous.

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,150
Seriously.

205
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,160
It would've been bad if we didn't come by today.

206
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,760
Since we'll be working together from now on, let us make this joint operation a success.

207
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,660
In many ways.

208
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,540
Let's go!

209
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,410
W-Wait for me!

210
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,710
Gosh, why is it so hot?

211
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,970
Is it because I haven't run in a while?

212
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,790
Or is it because I saw what I shouldn't have?

213
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,320
Let's just sleep.

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,950
Go to sleep.

215
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,860
Ji Yoo...

216
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,690
Are you studying, Ji Yoo?

217
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,960
Do you want some snacks?

218
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
I don't need any.

219
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,540
You should've come to dinner with us.

220
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,730
Why? Is there something wrong?

221
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,420
I mean... I just don't have any appetite.

222
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,630
Mom, I need to get to studying.

223
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,790
O-Okay. Sure, sure.

224
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,000
Study hard, sweetie.

225
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,610
 I heard suspicious sounds from the bathroom.

226
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,350
 Hurry up! Look the other way and close your eyes.

227
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,070
 You saw! You did! You definitely saw!

228
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,950
 I didn't! I didn't see!

229
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,500
 Come on, you naughty. What are you doing?

230
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,590
 My goodness.

231
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,230
 You're cute.

232
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:55,500
 In that place filled with steam and moisture were Aunt Young Shim...

233
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 and Mr. Kyeong Tae who were glazing at each other, touching each other up...

234
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,300
panting for breath and...

235
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,420
making weird—

236
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,420
What the heck?

237
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,490
♫  We always get into a fight as soon as we run into each other  ♫

238
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,420
♫  How can love ever happen between us?  ♫

239
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,310
♫  It's unfair how I've been waiting for you  ♫

240
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,710
♫  Why are you shaking me after appearing out of nowhere?  ♫

241
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,380
My goodness!

242
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,700
Do you hate me that much?

243
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,730
I told you not to touch even the tip of my finger!

244
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,150
Even so, how can you look at me as if I'm a bug?

245
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,110
Calm down.

246
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,180
 We'll now start the kick-off meeting for the new show.

247
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,210
Our show's theme is... Please look at the screen.

248
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:38,560
Six men and women who met for the first time will be spending three weeks under one roof.

249
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,630
We'll observe and film the feelings that naturally arise within those three weeks.

250
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,050
After those three weeks,

251
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,290
we'll listen to the participants' feelings and encourage them,

252
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,200
making this an innocent and harmless observant dating show.

253
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,130
One roof and three couples?

254
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,370
PD Oh Young Shim! I'm really disappointed here.

255
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,470
This looks like nothing more than a camping version of "Love Lines."

256
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,730
It's not just a dating camp you see everywhere.

257
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,120
Utilizing our IP, which became popular,

258
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,170
we'll be conveying retro trends and the advantages of observational entertainment—

259
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:24,770
Camping, survival, exposal, and virtual reality have all been done in dating shows.

260
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,570
We don't have our own innovation and uniqueness!

261
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,170
Excuse me...

262
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,090
CEO Wang?

263
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,710
It's not like every dating show needs to set a new record.

264
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,740
If we go overboard and a colluding incident like last time happens,

265
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,710
are you going to take responsibility?

266
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,430
I'm asking if you're going to!

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,920
 CEO Wang!

268
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,400
Excuse me, CEO Wang.

269
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,290
You should answer when someone asks you a question.

270
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,990
 Abnormal pulse. Warning.

271
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,990
 Your heart is racing.

272
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,530
- Huh? 
 - CEO Wang?

273
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,600
That sounds the most innovative out of everything I heard so far.

274
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,090
Setting a new record.

275
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,910
 Wang Kyeong Tae...

276
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,220
 Should I break open his Wang skull?  
  ("Wang" means king or king-size in Korean)

277
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,560
 Gosh, I can't. Easy, now.

278
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,220
 I decided not to use violence.

279
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,470
What do you think about this, everyone?

280
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,770
Please give your opinion on this matter freely.

281
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,370
Chae Dong, please hold me back.

282
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,830
Hold me back before I resort to violence.

283
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,660
 Ji Yoo, could I... ask you a favor?

284
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,550
 What is it?

285
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,200
 You know, between Aunt Young Shim and Mr. Kyeong Tae...

286
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,970
 If it looks like something is happening between them,

287
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,030
 could you let me know right away?

288
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,660

- Chae Dong. 
  - Chae Dong...

289
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,540
- Chae Dong. 
  - Aunt Young Shim and Mr. Kyeong Tae were

290
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,050
 on top of each other in the bathroom last night.

291
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,160
Chae Dong!

292
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,650
Hey—

293
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,610
 Senior!

294
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,090
 There's only one b-bathtub in our house.

295
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,310
 So we were both fighting to wash first, and you guys came in.

296
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,320
Chae Dong!

297
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,350
This is the conference room for Kingvely, right?

298
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,410
Hello, Young Shim.

299
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,390
Senior, should we take a break?

300
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,850
Sure. L-Let's take a 10-minute break before we resume.

301
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,830
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

302
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,910
What are you trying to do here?

303
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,790
CEO Wang, when will you leave Senior Young Shim's house?

304
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,510
What does that have to do with you, PD Lee?

305
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,930
If you can't leave, I was going to bring you out myself!

306
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,400
He's a total nutcase!

307
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,810
Crazy...

308
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,910

309
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,790
CEO Wang, we'll fix the proposal one more time.

310
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,500
Do you have time to make a new one?

311
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,190
If Kingvely will give us a good idea, we'll do our best to use it.

312
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,040
You should've said so from the beginning.

313
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,420
I wish Kingvely's identity would be shown properly.

314
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,540
I'm sure things only Kingvely can do will become our uniqueness.

315
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,340
But if we do a PPL so blatantly like that these days, it will actually backfire.

316
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,830
You can just do a good job without making it blatant, then.

317
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,640
Make it subtle but strong at the same time, and flashy without making it showy.

318
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,850
Is it that hard to do that?

319
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,010
How do you do it?

320
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,320
Should Kingvely and our broadcast station's employees have a blind date or something?

321
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,140
Blind date, my foot.

322
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,980
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:56,280
Well, this will be hard due to internal opposition.

324
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,460
This wouldn't have happened in the first place if you did a good job.

325
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,920
Who was the one to mess it up when we were doing fine?

326
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,070
It's a rightful demand, not messing it up.

327
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:11,820
Also, don't you remember who made it possible for this show to go on?

328
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,300
Planning and production costs are all thanks to Kingvely!

329
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,110
So you're abusing your power outright like this?

330
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,290
So what if you're a CEO when you're a mess as an individual?

331
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,210
Is money everything in life?

332
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,580
Hey, hold on.

333
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,930
Will you look over here, please?

334
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,840
I think we'll need some time to get to know each other.

335
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,610
Let's go to a workshop.

336
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:47,940
♫  I miss you and I want to hear you  ♫

337
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,170
♫  I want to go to you and I want to meet you  ♫

338
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:01,970
♫  I miss you and I want to hear you  ♫

339
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:08,050
♫  I want to go to you and I want to meet you  ♫

340
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,960

341
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,120
It's the beach!

342
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,250
 - Hey, amazing!  
 - Did we have to come this far?

343
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,180
 Come on, it's nice.

344
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,400
I guess it's nice being here after all this time.

345
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,840
♫  One means one, not two  ♫

346
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,310
♫  Two means two, not three  ♫

347
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,320
 I need to keep a lookout, so Young Shim won't fall for someone else.

348
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,540
♫  Four means four, it doesn't mean five  ♫

349
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,820
By the way, the beach and the boarding house here are all owned by Kingvely?

350
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,480
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

351
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,170
He came to shoot a commercial and bought the entire place when he found out it was in the auction.

352
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,140
- Amazing! 
 - It's amazing, right?

353
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,740
He just buys everything whenever he can...

354
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,890
Thanks to him, we get to enjoy this entire beach!

355
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,350
I compliment myself for suggesting a workshop.

356
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,790
All right, we'll begin the game!

357
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,040
- Yeah! 
  - Whoa!

358
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,820
It's a very important game where our show's direction and production cost are at stake.

359
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,040
You should each make a bet.

360
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,010
Well, then, we'll be betting...

361
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,500
150% increase in production cost!

362
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,760
 - Yay!  
 - Whoa!

363
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,850
You heard, right?

364
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,210
Okay.

365
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,910
Well, then, I want Kingvely's logo to be exposed in every episode,

366
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,680
a special OST for Kingvely, and lastly...

367
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,370
all cast members wear products from Kingvely in every episode!

368
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,180
 Whoa!

369
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,330
So cool!

370
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,780
 - Whoa!  
 - Is it possible?

371
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,970
Chae Dong, you heard. Right?

372
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,640
It's a deal, and we're in!

373
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,870
Applause!

374
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,420
Chae Dong, your physique is the best!

375
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,650
CEO Wang, be cool and strip, too!

376
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,640
CEO Wang, go get him!

377
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,620
I won't go easy.

378
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,690
You talk too much.

379
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,340
All right, both of you, get ready.

380
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,510
What's this?

381
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,640
Hey, what the heck?

382
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,340
What the heck is this?

383
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,820
Isn't this cheating? He's cheating!

384
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,360
Hey! Whoa...

385
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,370
CEO Wang, you need to work out.

386
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,680
Anyhow, Chae Dong is really amazing. Right?

387
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,580
It is a little anticlimactic.

388
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,750
Chae Dong, plant him on the ground!

389
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,140
Senior, we're almost done here.

390
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,820
 What are you even good at?

391
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,730
 Most of all, you lack charisma.

392
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,700
Kingvely won.

393
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,420
CEO Wang, you're so cool!

394
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,010
Sports isn't about strength.

395
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,870
♫  I miss you...  ♫

396
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,500
It's about strategy.

397
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,380
♫  ...and I want to hear you  ♫

398
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:31,500
♫  I want to go to you and I want to meet you  ♫

399
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,040
Gosh, what's your problem?

400
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
Soon Shim, you look exhausted.

401
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,640
I'll run in your place this time, so take a break.

402
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,780
So annoying.

403
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,330
Whatever.

404
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:57,450
If Kingvely wins this time, production costs will be cut by 30%!

405
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,220
If the staff team wins, put up the show's banner on

406
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,440
Kingvely's main home page until the show ends.

407
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:14,180
And also... after the show ends, send all staff members on a staycation!

408
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,090
 Whoa!

409
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,290
Whoa! Nice!

410
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,920
Chae Dong, whatever happens,

411
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,840
even if I fall, don't hesitate and drag me to the end if you have to.

412
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,650
Yes.

413
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,620
Come closer.

414
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,970
 - Oh Young Shim!  
  - Kingvely! Kingvely!

415
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,370
 - One, two! One, two!  
  - Oh Young Shim!

416
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,370
 One, two! One, two!

417
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,360
What the heck!

418
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,890
So suddenly? Come on, get back up.

419
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,020
- Get on my back. Come on. 
 - Oh, my.

420
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,970
Get on my back.

421
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,890
- G-Get on your back? 
 - Get on my back. Quickly.

422
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,390
- I think I'm going to fall. 
 - No, I got you.

423
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,940
I got—

424
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,020
Gosh, this won't do. We lost this one.

425
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,070
We won!

426
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,210
Jang Hwan, we won!

427
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,280
 Staycation! Staycation!

428
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,070
♫  Do it, so it  ♫

429
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,330
♫  Come on and do it  ♫

430
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:33,430

431
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,560
I've got something to say.

432
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,660
First of all, thank you, CEO Wang, for making this happen.

433
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:49,760
I'm just so thankful for this occasion, so please let me give a toast.

434
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,690
Even if it's boring, please applaud.

435
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,450
I want to try making a toast in French.

436
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,400
French, French! Drink until we drop in French!

437
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,730
- Nice to meet you. 
 - My pleasure.

438
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,600
Gosh, it's delicious.

439
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,430
- I shouldn't drink too much. 
 - There's something I want to do.

440
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,600
All right, let's play the alphabet game.

441
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,350
Worms!

442
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,650
Wait! That's not how you play that game!

443
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,650
Is he okay?

444
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,370
Gosh, why did I have to injure this part?

445
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,600
Came for a breather?

446
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,860
Why do you care?

447
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,160
You're making me care.

448
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,180
Aren't you limping your leg too much?

449
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,420
You got hurt during the game earlier. Right?

450
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,590
- Let me take a look. 
 - Mind your own business.

451
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,680
I'm fine.

452
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,920
It'll swell up more if you don't treat it. Let me see.

453
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,890
You were going overboard during the sand wrestling.

454
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,240
You could've just let him win.

455
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,700
How can I be a man and lose?

456
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,920
Hey! It's a lot more swollen than I expected.

457
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,650
Hey, this much is— Wait, y-you put too much!

458
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:52,600
Gosh, then and now, you exaggerate so much.

459
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,340
You're just the same.

460
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,970
- Gosh. 
 - Why did you spray so much?

461
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,470
- There! 
 - Ouch!

462
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,360
Move it.

463
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,290
I'm going to look at the ocean alone.

464
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,590
So leave now.

465
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,720
You bought the entire beach, and what now?

466
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,900
You can look at it whenever you want.

467
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,130
This is my first time seeing the beach in 10 years.

468
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,610
I didn't even get to look at a picture of the beach. All I did was work.

469
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,590
E-Even if you say that, I have no sympathy for you.

470
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,070
Why aren't you leaving?

471
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,730
Well... you also helped me when I was in danger.

472
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,450
A long time ago...

473
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,790
when I went to the beach with my friends and almost drowned.

474
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,780
Back then.

475
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,520
 P-Please help!

476
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,110
 I-It's too deep—

477
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,940
 Youngsim! It's dangerous!

478
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,100
 Please help!

479
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,080
 - Youngsim! 
 - Y-Youngsim... Youngsim first!

480
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,370
 Please save Youngsim first!

481
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,640
 Youngsim, wake up.

482
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,380
 You can't die!

483
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,260
 I need to save Youngsim.

484
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,570
 Just the way I learned in class, do CPR.

485
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,530
You knew about that?

486
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,270
Although I was half-awake,

487
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,390
I strangely remembered that.

488
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,760
Soon Shim told on me after getting an allowance from Dad.

489
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,260
So it came out in the cartoon, too. Didn't you see it?

490
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,140
I didn't have time to watch that.

491
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,660
I told you I didn't even have time to go to the beach.

492
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,040
What a showoff.

493
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,210
What about Uncle?

494
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,430
Does he still draw cartoons?

495
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,200
It looks like he does want to.

496
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,960
But his condition or ideas aren't the same as before.

497
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,060
Even so, I can't let my guard down.

498
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,690
My dad finds out like a psychic when something happens to me.

499
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,890
Then, couldn't today also be drawn as a cartoon later?

500
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,600
- Hey! 
 - Scared me!

501
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,830
Hey...

502
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,640
I said I couldn't let my guard down.

503
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,100
He might draw us again.

504
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:05,380
But why did you... act like you didn't know back then?

505
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,150
I didn't want to admit it.

506
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:18,120
That it was... Oh Young Shim's first kiss.

507
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,680
Do you hate it so much that I'm your first kiss?

508
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,260
You know that's not what I meant.

509
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,140
That's not it! I-It's...

510
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,840
What about you, then?

511
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,200
Why did you... disappear without a word?

512
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,410
You even broke our promise.

513
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,330
I still can't understand.

514
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,910
Back then...

515
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:52,150
why did you suddenly disappear without a word?

516
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,630
That's...

517
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,100
 Young Shim! Kyeong Tae! What are you doing?

518
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,150
Hurry up and come!

519
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,940
Okay!

520
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,560
O-Okay, we'll be right there!

521
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,420
I was wondering when the two of them disappeared.

522
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,620
But they're together, huh?

523
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,280
L-Let's go.

524
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,040
Let's go.

525
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,180
Gosh, my leg...

526
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,250
Gosh, w-wait.

527
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,650
Come and sit down!

528
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,350
Okay? Hurry back!

529
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,180
Chae Dong, now's not the time for that.

530
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,690
- Cheers, cheers. 
 - Cheers.

531
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,710
Hurry back.

532
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,020
Let's drink.

533
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,550
Everyone!

534
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:11,280
Finally, shall we begin a round of truth or dare?

535
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,460
I'd love to.

536
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,740
CEO Wang, choose your question.

537
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,690
Do we really need to go this far?

538
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,600
What does this have to do with team building?

539
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,720
Take a shot if you can't answer.

540
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,130
I just need to choose, right?

541
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,550
This one looks good.

542
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,940

543
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,560
Must I answer this?

544
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,800
What's the question?

545
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:08,740
"Does first love... come true? Yes or no?"

546
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,010
CEO Wang, you should answer for us.

547
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,960
They come true.

548
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,740
So romantic.

549
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,950
What the heck?

550
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,170
All right, all right! Let the spinning resume!

551
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,520
Twice in a row doesn't make sense.

552
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,200
Are you sure you didn't rig this?

553
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,500
This game is weird.

554
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,970
The questions are weird.

555
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,730

556
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,310
Geez, what's with this question?

557
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,100
How do I choose something like this?

558
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,630
Gosh, what is it?

559
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,950
"The person I like is currently present."

560
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,010
H-Here?

561
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,560
Penalty drink. Penalty drink. Penalty drink.

562
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:42,050

563
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,330
CEO Wang, you should answer the question.

564
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,780
The penalty is daunting.

565
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,610
W-What's the penalty?

566
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,160
Take a love shot with the person to your right!

567
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,730
What the heck?

568
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:10,200
"The person I like is currently here. Yes or no?"

569
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:15,400
♫  There are feelings that can't be contained  ♫

570
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,120
♫  A love that feels like it'll overflow  ♫

571
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:26,800
♫  I don't know what to do from time to time  ♫

572
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,460
♫  The words I spoke as a joke when we were young  ♫

573
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,350
♫  That I'll be yours forever  ♫

574
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:43,190
♫  I wasn't the only one who started having feelings that way  ♫

575
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:52,320
♫  Is your heart also racing toward me?  ♫

576
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,220
♫  Without a doubt  ♫

577
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,190

578
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:05,550
 When was your last skinship?  
  (Slang for physical intimacy)

579
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,400
 You're saying that wasn't skinship?

580
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,980
 Senior, what's he saying?

581
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,070
 Something really happened that night?

582
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,470
 Love Mark!

583
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,880
 You'll mark love?

584
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,420
 I guess I'll trust Kingvely.

585
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,680
 Don't laugh!

586
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,020
 What the hell?

587
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,230
 Don't the two of them seem similar?

588
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,090
 In what way? They don't suit each other at all.

589
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,020
 We received this many?

590
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,600
 So many people were accessing the page during the night that it froze.

591
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,700
 I fell for her just for who she is.

592
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,810
 Please help me.

593
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,080
 I oppose this.

594
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,080
 How desperate must he be to come all the way here?

595
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,960
 Chae Dong, worrying about your senior? You've come a long way!

596
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,280
 I'm a man, too, Senior.

597
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,190
 Hey, what's with you?
