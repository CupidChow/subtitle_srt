 Youngsim! Why are you going so fast? Wait for me!

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,700
 Gosh, why are you two wasting your strength?

15
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,510
 You guys are so childish.

16
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,250
 I'm going on ahead!

17
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,760

Yo Han!

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,550
Please appear on our show, will you?

23
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,830
An idol like you is really the perfect fit for my show.

24
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,790
I heard you trained as a cyclist up to middle school.

25
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,600
And your brother was a former athlete.

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Whoa. How did you find out all this?

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,630
It's really because my show really needs an idol

28
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,150
who has the blood of an athlete like you! Okay?

29
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,730
Please come out just once. I'll really do a good job this time.

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,400
I'll make you a top star!

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,770
I said I wouldn't do it.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,210
Please stop following me now.

33
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,370
She doesn't know when to give up.

34
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,650
I came all the way here. I can't go back.

35
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,070
- PD Oh... 
 - Yes?

36
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,800
you won't change my mind doing this.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,320
It's no use, so leave now.

38
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,610
In that case, what about this?

39
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,360
Come out on my show if I arrive at that bridge before you.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,860
Okay? Deal?

41
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,410
You think that's possible?

42
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,910
What if I really win?

43
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,570
I'll come out on your show, then.

44
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,730
Although it'll never happen.

45
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,910
Okay. You have to keep your promise!

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,050
Kneecaps, I trust you.

47
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,930
All right. One, two!

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,100
I'm going to cast you this time for sure!

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,360
PD Oh, are you okay?

50
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,730
She's unstoppable.

51
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,080
All right, you win!

52
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,920
I'll come out on your show.

53
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,360
I can do it.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I can do it.

55
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,700
I can do it.

56
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,430
I can do it!

57
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,790
Sir, would you like some dessert?

58
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
Sure.

59
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,630
Please enjoy.

60
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,040

61
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,950
What the heck?

62
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,820
Oh! Hey, great timing.

63
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,680
- Are you okay? 
 - I cast Han Yo Han, you know?

64
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,500
I sacrificed my body.

65
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,780
- Han Yo Han? Oh, my. 
 - Wait.

66
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,610
I guess my kneecaps weren't sacrificed for nothing.

67
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,420
Hey! Hey!

68
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,000
- It feels off. Take this to my seat. 
 - Y-Yes.

69
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,600
Yes, Chief.

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,460
Yes, your show was taken down.

71
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,230
Wow! How can you do this without even talking to me about it?

72
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,590
Does this make sense?

73
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,620
I even cast Han Yo Han this morning, the hottest one lately!

74
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,280
You really can't do this to me! What will he think of me?

75
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,050
It was decided by the higher-ups during reprogramming!

76
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,250
I can't help it, either.

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,740
I won't accept this!

78
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,530
And if you don't? What, what, what? What will you do?

79
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,460
I'll have to butt my head!

80
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,720
I mean, of all shows, why is it always my show that's canceled?

81
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,340
"Of all shows"? They were just letting you go so far!

82
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,170
Hey, we can cover the walls of our station with the apology letters you wrote!

83
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,630
I told you to shoot variety shows. Why shoot detective shows?

84
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,480

85
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,700

86
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,560

87
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,150
"PD Oh of a broadcasting station who had a fistfight with a cast who has sexual assault records."

88
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,900
In my opinion, I'll be dying early, thanks to you.

89
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,520
Don't gather people's attention with these.

90
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,340
You need to make your show popular.

91
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,280
Do I just stay still in those situations? Justice comes first!

92
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,750
I think justice comes before provocative shows.

93
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,850
- Ms. Oh Young Shim. 
 - Yes!

94
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,990
You're a PD for variety shows, not documentaries.

95
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,240
All right?

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,060
I know.

97
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,870
Anyhow, consider this program reshuffle a measure to deal with enthusiasm no one wants.

98
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,880
No one...

99
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,460
Please consider my position, too.

100
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,270
Although my temper is shitty like this, I still get hurt, too!

101
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm going to tear up for real.

102
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,690
I'm going to cry.

103
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,160
Just look at you.

104
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,600
Crying those insincere tears.

105
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,700
Hey, hey, hey. I'm saying this so you'll get hurt!

106
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,110
Please do nothing for a while.

107
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,140
Get out!

108
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,760
Looks like you were having a conversation.

109
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,240
Yes, I'm having an important talk right now. Come back later.

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,360
No, no. Not at all.

111
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,470
- Come in, Hee Jin. You can come in. 
 - Okay.

112
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,670
Sorry, Senior.

113
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,500
I'm going to be starting a new show this time.

114
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,630
- Yes. 
 - Oh?

115
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,310
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

116
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,750
Hee Jin is making her debut.

117
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,420
Congrats.

118
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,260
Everything's going well, right?

119
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,100
Of course.

120
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,380
Well, don't you feel anything seeing your junior debuting before you?

121
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,350
Senior...

122
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,300
- Chief. 
 - Senior, sir.

123
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,830
Call me Chief.

124
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,000
Senior, sir!

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,050
What?

126
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,320
I ended up this way because you oppose

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,420
every show I do and take down even the ones I have left.

128
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,180
Help me out here!

129
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,360
- Oh Young Shim... 
 - What?

130
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,390
Variety shows are a jungle, too!

131
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,820
Finding your source of food quickly is the only way to survive!

132
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,380
I know. I know it!

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,930
Gosh, what am I going to do for real, then?

134
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,370
If I really do nothing because you said so,

135
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,180
you'll kick me out, saying I'm just fooling around.

136
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,290
Fortunately, you can still read between the lines!

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,880
What are you doing? Get out!

138
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,020
Get your face out of here!

139
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,600
Why are you yelling? I'll take my leave!

140
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,940

141
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,920
What...

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,030
Huh?

143
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,940
- Hey, wait— 
 - What's this?

144
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,330
H-Hey, hey, hey.

145
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,090
- I see! 
 - N-No, it's not.

146
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,800
I-It's a new pilot show proposal. It has nothing to do with you.

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,590
Oh, yes, yes.

148
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,850
It's the one that's being held back due to a lack of staff. I can take it, then.

149
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,090
You'll take this?

150
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,250
- Yes. 
 - No, no, no.

151
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,130
It's fine. It's fine. I'll get someone else.

152
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,110
Nope, nope, nope.

153
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,890
I also know dating. I'm also good at it.

154
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,160
You know I get things done terrifyingly well once I get hooked, right?

155
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,990
I'll try my best here.

156
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,250
No, no, no.

157
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,620
No, you don't know.

158
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,700
You really don't. You wouldn't know dating! You shouldn't know!

159
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,330
 You're doing a dating show, Senior?

160
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,800
Yes.

161
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,590
To survive in this heartless entertainment jungle, I had to take it.

162
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,760
A pilot episode will air soon.

163
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,800
Love Lines?

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,520
Dating programs aren't easy.

165
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,180
But, Senior, how long has it been since your last relationship?

166
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,160
- Two, three, four, five— 
 - Hey!

167
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
Why is that important, huh?

168
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,450
I told you the most important aspect of a program is authenticity.

169
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,000
Whatever. Forget it if you don't want to! Forget it!

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,040
- Forget it if you don't want to! 
 - No, no, no!

171
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,940
No, no, no.

172
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,950
No, Senior.

173
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,870
I'll help you. Don't worry so much.

174
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,200
Right? You'll join me, right?

175
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,250
I really need to do well this time.

176
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,650
I almost got canned earlier.

177
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:22,400
Speaking of which, what do you think is the most important point of a dating program?

178
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,570
- Point? 
 - Yeah.

179
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,370
In my opinion,

180
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,220
- the point of a dating program... 
 - Yeah?

181
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,350
is that the characters give it life and are the narrative itself.

182
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,790
If there's a very attractive cast that moves my heart,

183
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,200
then I don't need anything else, Senior.

184
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,660
Where will I find a very attractive layperson right away?

185
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,530
Exactly.

186
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,960
It'll be hard to do right away.

187
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,720
Especially nowadays, it'd be bad if you cast someone and they spark a controversy.

188
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,740
You're going through a lot to protect my forehead.

189
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,220
You'll hurt yourself, Senior.

190
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,770
Stop recklessly using your head for random things.

191
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,550
It's because my head isn't working properly.

192
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,400
Where do I even start? Shit...

193
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,980
This is the perfect time to use a friend chance.

194
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,390
Friend chance?

195
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,470
I don't know if it'll work out, but I'll give them a call.

196
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,950
I'll also reach out to my colleagues.

197
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,460
No!

198
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,180
Isn't Oh Young Shim the queen of casting?

199
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,970
I'll take care of this. I can do this!

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
- You can do this! 
 - I can do it.

201
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,370
Let's go. Go, go, go!

202
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,210
Geez, there's no one to contact.

203
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,730
She'll definitely decline...

204
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,350
 Senior Oh Young Shim won't make it.

205
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,140
Did you hear?

206
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,370
Oh Young Shim is doing the pilot program.

207
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,680
What?

208
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,580
Gosh, she's such a tireless busybody.

209
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,970
Why does the director have a soft spot for her?

210
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,440
I'd leave on my own if my junior debuted first.

211
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,180
She doesn't even have any self-respect.

212
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,840
If she has any tact, she'll leave after shooting this program.

213
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,100
Our department is going to lay people off.

214
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,200
Why does Chae Dong follow Oh Young Shim around?

215
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,550
Chae Dong's reputation will only keep getting tarnished.

216
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,710
Could the rumor about her lending him money be true?

217
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,370
- That's it! 
 - Right?

218
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,400
I think that's it!

219
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,230
Gosh, thanks so much for your concern.

220
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,630
Since it ended up this way, I'm going to give it my best.

221
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,630
You... do your best, too.

222
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,630
Fighting!

223
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,360

224
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,670

225
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,900

226
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,790
Oh Young Shim, you're sucking the energy out of me. What's wrong?

227
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,640
Lighten up.

228
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,260
I think the god of variety shows has abandoned me.

229
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,570
Was he ever with you?

230
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,380
Don't you remember?

231
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,970
Twenty years ago, not a single person in Korea

232
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,610
didn't know my name through the cartoon Youngsim.

233
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,510
My childhood was a bit of a mess because of that...

234
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,450
Anyway,

235
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,130
I must've used up my entire life's worth of fame back then.

236
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,150
Let's see, let's see.

237
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,480
From your viewpoint,

238
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,770
if you go east, there is an important person for you.

239
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,370
It's your fortune for this month.

240
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,340
East from my viewpoint?

241
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,050
This is west, so...

242
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,490
Oh Soon Shim is sitting in the east.

243
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,590
Never mind...

244
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,080
Are you interested in joining a TV program?

245
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,530
Me?

246
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,610
You want me to join a program you're creating?

247
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
No, no, no.

248
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,850
Are you looking down on me, too?

249
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,110
If I tell you to join, you should just join.

250
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,220
In this day and age, if you make a wrong move on TV,

251
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,760
you'll have a scarlet letter trailing after you forever. You know better than anyone.

252
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,670
I don't want to.

253
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,550
Furthermore, I'm starting a new job next week,

254
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,320
so it won't do me any good to appear on TV.

255
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,000
- A new job? 
- Yeah.

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,180
Ta-da.

257
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,080
 Everyone, come down for dinner.

258
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,660
- Okay! 
 - Okay.

259
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,180
Is it a special day?

260
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,930
Geez, what kind of aunt are you?

261
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,030
It's our Ji Yoo's birthday today.

262
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,950
Lee Ji Yoo.

263
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,380
It's your birthday today?

264
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,330
She has no reaction.

265
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,170
She's going through puberty. Please understand.

266
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,490
What kind of a kid puts on that much makeup?

267
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,930
Ji Yoo is really interested in her looks these days.

268
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,570
Right, Ji Yoo?

269
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,060
I wouldn't need makeup if I were as pretty as Mom.

270
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,930
Who do I take after that I'm so ugly?

271
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,670
It's 8:00.

272
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,400
All right. Let's eat.

273
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,020
So, no one in our family goes on dates on holidays?

274
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,330
Young Shim, no dates for a holiday?

275
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,820
No way.

276
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,610
Dates, my foot.

277
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,570
Oh Young Shim doesn't even update her cellphone.

278
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:32,220
She looks perfectly fine, has a job, and everything a woman needs.

279
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,330
What does Young Shim lack that she can't date anyone?

280
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,120
Fine, my foot.

281
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,310
She doesn't have a man because she's not fine.

282
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,500
You used to call me your muse for your cartoons.

283
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,000
This is partially your fault, too.

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,530
What does your inability to date have to do with my cartoon?

285
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,110
I think I told you at least 3,000 times.

286
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,570
Everyone I meet asks me to sing the song.

287
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,220
They ask me if Soon Shim is pretty.

288
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,060
They just think of me as the funny girl who came out in the cartoon.

289
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,640
Even though I raised her for over 30 years, she blames all her faults on her parents.

290
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,810
Dad, finish eating—

291
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,680
Did I say something wrong?

292
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,970
What's Dad's problem now?

293
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,220
Hormonal changes from andropause. Eat up.

294
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,730
The god of inspiration has abandoned me.

295
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,000
It's about time for him to return...

296
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,830
 Tomorrow's the deadline.

297
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,020
 Why can't I think of anything?

298
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,320
 Mr. Star, you know tomorrow's midterm. Right?

299
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,370
 Oh, my. You're aware, so hurry up and tell you what I want?

300
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,500
 Please let everything I studied be on the exam tomorrow.

301
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,190
 And please put haughty Wol Sook and Kyeong Tae in their places.

302
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,500
 It should be an easy task for you, Mr. Star.

303
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,330
 Right?

304
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,030
 She's my daughter, but she's something special.

305
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,670
 Oh Young Shim.

306
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,750
 Gosh, where did a girl like that come from?

307
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,580
 Huh?

308
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,960
 Yes, that's right. This is what I needed.

309
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,310
 An unprecedented and phenomenal... adolescent character in her own world!

310
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,820
 It's always the last place you look!

311
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,990
 That's right.

312
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,960
 Artist Oh Dae Gwang, who drew the "Youngsim" cartoon... is none other than my dad.

313
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,430
 I was away on vacation.

314
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,810
 Gosh, what's the matter with me?

315
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,090

316
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,360
 My goodness, Mr. Star. None of this is from what I studied.

317
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,370
 I can't see anything.

318
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,440
 I guess it can't be helped now.

319
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,780
 Whoa, Mr. Star, thank you. I got number four!

320
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,640
 Left hand is you, Mr. Star, and right hand is me.

321
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,060
 Rock, paper, scissors, set, shoot!

322
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,390
 Gosh, I failed this test, too.

323
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,350
 Oh Youngsim scored first place for this midterm exam.

324
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,620
 What?

325
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,690
 Whoa!

326
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,800
 Last problem is to guess the author of a poem.

327
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,740
 I planted the parasol tree to see the phoenix—

328
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,300
 The answer is Hwang Jini!

329
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,720
 Incorrect!

330
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,370
 - Jeong Cheol! 
 - Incorrect!

331
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,640
 - The answer is Lee Doo Beom! 
 - Incorrect!

332
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,450
 - Gosh. 
 - That's not correct?

333
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,460
 What do I do? I've never heard of this before.

334
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,640
 Oh Youngsim is the only one who has a chance now. Oh Youngsim?}

335
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,450
 All right. Since things came down to this... here goes nothing!

336
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,710
 All right, Oh Youngsim. Who's the author of this poem?

337
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,430
 I-I don't know.

338
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,850
 Oh, you don't know? Anonymous...

339
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,720
 Yes, that's the answer!

340
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,430
 Congratulations!

341
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,830
 What the heck, Oh Youngsim? She's always so lucky.

342
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,040
 My future husband's face will show up if I do this, huh?

343
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,090
 What if he shows up, but he's ugly?

344
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,350
 Why isn't he showing up?

345
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,690
 Youngsim, what are you doing?

346
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,410
 No way.

347
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,970
 Is that me?

348
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,280
 Yes.

349
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,020
 Wait!  You used my story and face without my permission.

350
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,120
 Are you all enjoying this right now?

351
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,260
 Come on, this is among family members.

352
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,750
 He's right. You need to congratulate Dad since this is his debut work.

353
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,070
 Congrats, Dad.

354
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,930
 Thank you.

355
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,570
 Work of art?

356
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,060
 That's clearly my private life.

357
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,560
 Dad, please say something. Huh?

358
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,980
 I did it because it was a waste to watch you alone, even if you're my daughter.

359
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,860
 But the publishing company's employees just loved it.

360
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,230
 So I scrapped what I'd been drawing for three years

361
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,600
 and decided to go with you, Young Shim.

362
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,950
 - Dad! 
 - Yes?

363
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,520
 You could've at least made me pretty.

364
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,410
 Is my forehead that wide?

365
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,800
 Is my temper that bad?

366
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,700
 Young Shim, be proud.

367
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,500
 You're Artist Oh Dae Gwang's muse!

368
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,130
 Young Shim, thanks to you... he finally paid off the mortgage.

369
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,910
 Does that mean we don't need to move?

370
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,900
 - Yes. 
 - Hurray!

371
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,180
 Hurray!

372
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,520
 That's how the most sensitive middle schooler Oh Young Shim's adolescence

373
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,920
 was opened to the entire country

374
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,530
 and Dad's debut work "Oh! Youngsim," contrary to everyone's expectations...

375
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,470
 ended up getting a high viewer rating.

376
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,880
 Are you Young Shim?

377
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,930
 Oh, you're Young Shim, huh?

378
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,800
 Young Shim, be good friends with Kyeong Tae.

379
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,100
 Young Shim, I really enjoyed the cartoon.

380
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,630
 After that day, people all talked to me as if they knew everything about me...

381
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,350
 liking or hating me without even knowing better.

382
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,580
 Of course, that includes my family.

383
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,490
I mean, Father-in-Law must have had enough.

384
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,850
Young Shim, he's telling you to have a lovey-dovey relationship like other people,

385
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,130
eventually, meet your match, get married, and live happily.

386
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,350
No one marries because they're old enough these days.

387
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,490
Everyone does fine without marrying.

388
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,240
Young Shim, live alone if you are capable.

389
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,890
You're living happily with Brother-in-law, though.

390
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,120
You and Brother-in-law are my role models.

391
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,830
Oh. I see.

392
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,250
Gosh, sure, sure.

393
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:07,910
Of course, a man like... your brother-in-law is fine, too. Yes.

394
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,880
Gosh, where will I meet a man like him?

395
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,830
Huh? It's "Studio of Love."

396
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,100
Dear, we met on "Studio of Love" for the first time. Right?

397
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,030
Do you remember?

398
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,770
You're right.

399
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,800
I had forgotten about that.

400
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,980
I fell for her at first sight.

401
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,940
He was a really popular singer at that time.

402
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,340
- Yes. 
 - You all remember, right?

403
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,520
Yes, I was almost godlike at one point.

404
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,620
Did that show disappear, by the way?

405
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,630
It was such a popular show.

406
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,250
Hey, that show has been gone for years.

407
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,270
There's no hope.

408
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,820
Come on. She isn't totally hopeless.

409
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,530
She has a junior at work who likes her.

410
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,400
That guy who looks like a puppy brought cake and chicken on Sis's birthday!

411
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,120
I thought he was cute.

412
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,440
- Chae Dong? 
 - Huh?

413
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,120
No, I'm not like that with him.

414
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,650
Oh Young Shim... just date when you've got someone who likes you.

415
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,710
She's right. Chae Dong...

416
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,580
The kid who used to always follow...

417
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,020
Young Shim around every day with cream puffs in his hands!

418
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,230
Hey, it's Kyeong Tae!

419
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,970
Gosh, you idiot!

420
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,580
- Who's Kyeong Tae? 
 - Shush.

421
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,990
It's the guy whose name is a lifetime taboo for Young Shim.

422
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,860
This is clearly... Wang Kyeong Tae's curse, for sure.

423
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,420
All right.

424
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,790
It all started back then.

425
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,540
 Young Shim, let's play.

426
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,910
 I don't want to.

427
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,430
 Why do you dislike me?

428
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,460
 In short, you're not attractive.

429
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,410
 Firstly, you're short and ugly.

430
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,300
 That's the same for you, though.

431
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,340
 That's exactly the point!

432
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,430
 You don't understand a girl's heart.

433
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:38,810
 Your mental age is low, and most of all, you lack charisma.

434
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:44,190
 I don't think it's good to classify people into tall and short like you do.

435
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,570
 I think they need to be classified into those who are diligent and those who aren't.

436
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:54,750
 However, if someone's tall and diligent... wouldn't he be even cooler?

437
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,690
 A-A person should be judged based on the contents of his life.

438
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,140
 Really?

439
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,760
 Try climbing up the tree at the park.

440
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,810
 The tree? How?

441
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,270
 See?

442
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,850
 That's the difference between you and me.

443
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,260
 Don't even think about a tree you can't climb.

444
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,050
 If that's what you mean, I can climb it.

445
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,780
 I can do anything if it's for you.

446
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,400
 Can you live up to your words?

447
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,680
 It's too high.

448
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,420
 It's scary.

449
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,140
 Please help me!

450
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,160
 Somebody get me down!

451
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,390
 Young Shim...

452
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,370
 Young Shim!

453
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,010
 Young Shim...

454
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,980
 Young Shim!

455
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,600
 Happy birthday, Young Shim.

456
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,040
 This is what you wanted at that time.

457
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,530
 I even engraved your name on it.

458
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,620
 Sure, I appreciate it.

459
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,570

460
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,600
 Then, you can hang out on my birthday. Right?

461
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,390
 Sure, well...

462
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,500
 A promise is a promise.

463
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,260
 Meet me at the park at 6:00 p.m.

464
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,840
 Okay.

465
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,780
 What the heck?

466
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,530
 Where's Wang Kyeong Tae?

467
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,620
 He dares to make me wait?

468
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,980
 Wait until he shows up.

469
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,920
 I'll destroy him.

470
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,020
 Kyeong Tae went to America to study abroad.

471
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,590
 To study abroad?

472
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,540
 - When will he return? 
 - That's odd.

473
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,510
 Didn't Kyeong Tae tell you? We decided to emigrate.

474
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,570
 We'll be following him soon.

475
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,520
 Emigrate?

476
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,070
 After that, Wang Kyeong Tae disappeared like a lie.

477
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,450
 I thought I'd feel lighthearted.

478
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:30,800
 Oddly, I felt empty... as if a part of my heart had a gaping hole.

479
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,710
I still don't understand him.

480
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:51,390
I admit I was a bit hard on him,

481
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:56,910
but how could he break his promise and leave without a word?

482
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,230
Petty bastard.

483
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,940
Come on, Dad.

484
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,620
I'm sorry for complaining earlier.

485
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,210
Forget it.

486
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,510
I'll pretend I never heard anything.

487
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,040
Just live your life doing whatever you want.

488
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,190
I'm doing a dating—

489
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,030
Dating?

490
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,510
No.

491
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,090
I've been assigned a dating program.

492
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,200
I thought you were actually dating someone!

493
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,530
I might not be able to date in real life,

494
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,420
but I'm going to create an excellent dating program.

495
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,910
I'll do my best and be recognized,

496
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:23,160
so you can proudly draw a successful Youngsim again.

497
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,030
All right. Thanks.

498
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,280

499
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,920
I didn't even write that.

500
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,370
Oh! I know this person from Instagram.

501
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,350
Whoa, Senior. How did you cast all these people?

502
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,900
I used all the networking I've built up to now

503
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,370
and I begged until my knees wore down.

504
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,850
I wrote handwritten letters. I also sent about 3,000 DMs.

505
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,360
- 3,000? 
 - Yeah.

506
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,040
Amazing!

507
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,890
Senior, you really are determined this time.

508
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,740
Of course, I am.

509
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,400
It's a dating program,

510
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,960
so it would be nice to have one more unique female cast.

511
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,360

512
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,550
Hey! I can cast one of my friends.

513
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,140
- Your friend? 
 - Yeah.

514
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,260
She has a dating YouTube channel or something.

515
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,260
What do you think? Not bad, right?

516
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,750
Not bad at all.

517
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,660
Wait. I'll make a call.

518
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,400
Yeah, it's not bad.

519
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,070

520
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,570

521
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,680

522
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,030
Hey, Young Shim. It's been a while.

523
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,590
Hi, Wol Sook! How have you been?

524
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,400
I'll cut to the chase.

525
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,280
I was assigned a dating program.

526
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,270
Would you like to be on it?

527
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,310
You want to cast me for your program?

528
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,120
Yeah, the shooting only takes one day.

529
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,130
Please do me this favor. What are friends for?

530
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,120
It would be great for promoting your dating channel, too.

531
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,420
You said it's just a one-episode pilot, though.

532
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,100
I don't think it's on my level.

533
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,680
Who are the other cast members?

534
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,630
Really hot lay people.

535
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,250
 Oh, lay people?

536
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,260
It doesn't hold appeal, but I'll think about it.

537
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,710
Oh, but don't get your hopes up.

538
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,990
You're also really hot—

539
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,750
Gosh, Goo Wol Sook.

540
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,770
She's still the same old braggart.

541
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,030
Senior, did your friend agree?

542
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,720
Yeah, add her to the list for now. I'll cast her no matter what.

543
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,840
Whoa, look at that drive.

544
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,010
Look, look.

545
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:09,830
Okay, then. Everything's almost ready.

546
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,080
There's just one male left, right?

547
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,350
Right.

548
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,990
One is a health trainer and one is a poet.

549
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,360
The remaining one should be...

550
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,860
You know those young people who run startups these days? CEOs.

551
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,210
Young CEOs. How about someone like that?

552
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:37,380
Senior, if we're talking about startups, how about this person?

553
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,480
Who is this?

554
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,300
It's Kingvely, an on-the-rise unicorn startup.

555
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,050
They made a lot of money through fashion e-commerce and their CEO just arrived in Seoul.

556
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,010
Senior, if this man joins, forget scripts and outcomes and whatnot.

557
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:55,110
We'll be the top-searched program and make a big hit for sure.

558
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,930
It will be impossible to cast him.

559
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,720
He rejected all offers he had received so far.

560
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,320
Who am I?

561
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,610
Aren't I, Oh Young Shim, the queen of casting?

562
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,760
I'll give it a shot.

563
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,950
Huh?

564
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,750
Holy cow.

565
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,680

He's a startup CEO...

566
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,330
He's got a crazy good revenue.

567
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,600
Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, million...

568
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,580
Is it going into the trillions?

569
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,890
How many zeros are there?

570
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,820

571
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,010

572
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,770
His identity is veiled, huh?

573
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,510
The mystery is also a plus.

574
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,020
I'll cast him, no matter what it takes.

575
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,640
Wait... Kingvely?

576
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,670
Kingvely. That sounds familiar.

577
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,400
 I'm starting a new job next week

578
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,120
 so it won't do me any good to appear on TV.

579
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,820
 - A new job? 
 - Yeah.

580
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,940
 Ta-da.

581
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,650
Soon Shim! Soon Shim! Over here, over here!

582
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,770
Soon Shim, Soon Shim, over here.

583
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,750
Why are you looking for Soon Shim here?

584
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm Oh Ha Yoon.

585
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,070
And why do you look like a bum?

586
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,270
You're embarrassing me, gosh.

587
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,500
Geez, I don't have time to argue with you right now.

588
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,540
First off, I...

589
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,450
Wait, first, congratulations on joining Kingvely.

590
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,590
Sure, thanks.

591
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,740
Let me cut to the chase and ask you a question.

592
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,620
What is it?

593
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,490
Do you know anything about your company's CEO?

594
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,890
Why are you suddenly interested in our company?

595
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,510
And why are you curious about our CEO?

596
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,730
I'm creating a program and I'm considering casting your CEO.

597
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,680
Keep dreaming.

598
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:19,170
Sis, an old saying goes, "Don't even look at a tree you can't climb."

599
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,240
I haven't even laid eyes on him yet.

600
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,740
I heard he arrived in Seoul. You must have his contact information.

601
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,060
It must show up in the company directory or something.

602
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,230
- Oh Young Shim. 
 - What?

603
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,400
I'm telling you based on a woman's instinct, but I don't have a good feeling.

604
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,510
So how about backing off from our company?

605
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,370
And...

606
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:44,090
do you think a relationship virgin like you is suited for a dating program?

607
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,770
Did you call me here for this? I'm leaving.

608
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:53,680
Does paying off your credit card bill for this month give you a good feeling?

609
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,370
What did you say? Card bill?

610
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:04,250
PD Oh, what were we talking about again?

611
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,950
What did you want to know?

612
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,920
His contact info.

613
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,650
Will his email address suffice?

614
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,600

615
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,690

616
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,670

617
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,440

618
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,190

619
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,080

620
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,980
Stop staring and drink up, Senior.

621
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,120
If Kingvely hasn't responded until now, they're not interested.

622
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm feeling oddly obstinate.

623
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,730
If it doesn't work out, there are other startup CEOs.

624
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,750
Other startups?

625
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,760
Gosh, fine, you're right.

626
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,950
Let's do this, then.

627
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,760
If they don't contact me while we're here, I'll give up.

628
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,720
Yeah, no questions asked.

629
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,330
 I went to the Secretary's Office earlier and happened to hear

630
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,650
 Mark got a casting offer for a dating show.

631
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,500
 Will Mark really go out on the show?

632
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,510
 He's definitely not doing it.

633
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,280
 Mark earnestly values his private life.

634
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,650
 But the effects will be great if he goes out.

635
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,990
 We also have the IPO issue.

636
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:11,900
Senior... are you really not going home?

637
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,380
I haven't been home for three days to help you. What the heck is this?

638
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,790
You can still go ahead and get a good sleep.

639
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,840
I'm so sad. So sad.

640
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,990
You won't even understand my feelings.

641
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,220
What do you mean I don't understand?

642
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,540
I know it all. You think I don't know how tough you have it?

643
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,930
This big sister will compensate you for them all.

644
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,530
Gosh, I don't have it tough...

645
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,070
But how will you?

646
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,860
How are you going to compensate me? Hurry up and tell me.

647
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,630
Is there something you want?

648
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,980
I'll grant you anything you want. Tell me.

649
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,870
Really? Anything I want?

650
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,780
Man, what is it? What's the wait for?

651
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,470
Hurry up before I change my mind.

652
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,960
Senior...

653
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,960
I think you're the only one who doesn't know this at work.

654
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,390
In fact...

655
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,500
I, Chae Dong...

656
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,400
- It came! 
 - It came?

657
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,530
It came?

658
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,830
- It came. 
 - Really?

659
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,560
It came!

660
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,160
H-Hey, you brought the company card. Right?

661
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,890
- Yes. 
 - I'll see you later.

662
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,140
Whoa, amazing!

663
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,810
Boss, ring me up, please.

664
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:49,500
On the condition of PPL throughout the entire program?

665
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,280
Whoa. He got a great deal, acting like he didn't want it.

666
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,720
Looks like things are going to work out for me. Getting Kingvely casted and all...

667
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,440
You don't need to see his face in person?

668
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,490
If he's handsome, that's great and

669
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,600
if he's ugly, that will also be a hot topic.

670
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,820
I only cast him for the popularity, so it doesn't matter anyway.

671
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,540

Whoa, what the heck?

672
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,740

I'll come out on that show of yours.

673
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,590
Yes!

674
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,950
Hey, hey. After Mark Wang, Goo Wol Sook also replied.

675
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,040
Hey, everything worked out!

676
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,350
Hey, Wol Sook said she'd come out on my show.

677
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,520
Goo Wol Sook...

678
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,010
Sis, do you still hang out with Wol Sook?

679
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,170
Gosh, I've got a bad feeling about this.

680
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,690
Be careful.

681
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,700
That girl always backstabs you when it matters the most.

682
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,600
Goo Wol Sook. Well, that's all in the past.

683
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,640
Wouldn't Wol Sook have turned a new leaf now?

684
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,720
We're getting old together. We can help each other out.

685
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,380
I'll be getting a sweet sleep now.

686
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,390
- Take this and go inside first. 
 - Okay, got it.

687
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,220
Can we move the podiums together? There are only four.

688
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,360
Let's get it done quickly.

689
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,840
All right. Be careful not to get hurt.

690
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,160
Please set it up as a full shot.

691
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,740

692
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,580
 This way, please.

693
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,010
 Senior.

694
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,900
- Hello! 
  - Hello.

695
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,200
Please make yourselves comfortable and say hi.

696
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,530
The main PD Oh Young Shim will give a quick run-through of today's shoot.

697
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,830
- Hello. I'm looking forward to working with you. 
 - Hello.

698
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,290
I think we're missing one person.

699
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,830
Gosh. I'll go and check. One moment, please.

700
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,880
I look forward to working with you today, and

701
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,590
for now, you can have the drinks and fruits in the green room until we start.

702
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,820
We'll notify you again before we go into the shoot.

703
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,020
- There's cold water inside, so, please. 
 - This way, please.

704
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,870
Please come this way.

705
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:12,000
We need to start the shoot. Why isn't he here?

706
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,780
- The last male participant, Mark, just arrived. 
 - Oh, really?

707
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,350
He came exactly on time.

708
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,090
You should tell him to hurry up and come in.

709
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,280
Why isn't he coming up?

710
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,400
He's coming from the elevator, not that way.

711
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,370
 Oh, that person is Mark?

712
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,090
Hello.

713
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:55,010

714
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:00,200
Hello. I'm Kingvely's CEO, Mark...

715
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,950
Wang Kyeong Tae.

716
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:09,990
♫  I'm calling for you and your name only  ♫

717
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:16,870
♫  Words I want to say to you fill up completely  ♫

718
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,380
 The Wang Kyeong Tae from 20 years ago...

719
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,910
 appeared in front of me again.

720
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:34,460
♫  The entire world is becoming dyed white  ♫

721
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,300

722
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,930
 The second female participant got in a car accident on the way.

723
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,030
 A car accident?

724
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,740
 Although you lack the charms, you've got the skills and cheats. Right?

725
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,120
 Young Shim?

726
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,200
 - You don't know Young Shim? 
 - Is that a person's name?

727
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,400
 What are you even good at?

728
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,430
 Didn't you wear glasses when you were young?

729
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,190
 Why aren't you saying anything?

730
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:01,220
 The person who scores higher on the song gets a wish in this mission.

731
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,840
 A person who doesn't cherish other people's feelings wouldn't understand this.

732
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,110
 Don't you remember, Young Shim?

733
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,630
♫  I look back  ♫
