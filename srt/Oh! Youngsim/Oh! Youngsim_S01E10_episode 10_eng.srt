1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,930

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,710

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,720

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,490

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,220

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,530

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,800

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,290

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:57,060
Then... this was my birthday gift from 20 years ago?

10
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,940
Yeah.

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,410
Although... I couldn't give it to its owner because he ghosted me.

12
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:16,060
That day... why did you suddenly disappear without a word?

13
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,520

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,710
 What are you doing right now? Give it back.

15
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,420
 Where did you get these?

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,500
 What's it got to do with you?

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,430
 Seriously.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,480
Those headphones... were really precious to me.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,070
I only gave them to you because it was you.

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,900
But I only saw red... when I saw them in someone else's hands.

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,710
You should've asked me about them.

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,100
I only lent them to him for a few days because of his situation.

23
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,920
I thought you gave them to someone without a second thought.

24
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,190
I'm sorry... for losing something precious to you.

25
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,120
We can't even buy new ones.

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,250
But those headphones... I have them.

27
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,330
Although... they are broken.

28
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,320
Really?

29
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,340
But why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:41,170
Because that day was when I realized... that Oh Young Shim will never like me.

31
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,050
It wasn't like that.

32
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,290
Why did you treat me like that, then?

33
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,140
You never once acknowledged my feelings.

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,760
♫  The words I spoke as a joke when we were young  ♫

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,250
♫  That I'll be yours forever  ♫

36
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,160
I must've wanted to annoy you.

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,040
I wanted to know if you'd...

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,910
continue to like me even if I treated you like that.

39
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:23,780
♫  Is your heart also racing toward me?  ♫

40
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,140
Even so, you were too cruel.

41
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,440
But didn't you also...

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,870
not like me enough to trust me?

43
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,120
No.

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,490
It was because I had no self-confidence, Young Shim.

45
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,690
Then what about now?

46
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,320
Do you feel more confident now?

47
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,220
The reason I am who I am today...

48
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,750
is all thanks to you in some way.

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,590
Since I lived diligently to become...

50
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,600
more confident today.

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,480
Since your success was thanks to me,

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,710
grant me a wish.

53
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,840
You said it yourself.

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,470
 My wish is for Oh Young Shim to...

55
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,730
 have her wish granted.

56
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,410
 That's all I need.

57
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,930
How did you know that?

58
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,600
I saw it while editing.

59
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,110
I'll use that wishing chance right now.

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,830
This is my wish.

61
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,790
♫  I stay up all night, every day  ♫

62
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,210
Becoming 100% sincere with our feelings right now.

63
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:10,830
♫  I promised I'd stay by your side  ♫

64
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:18,880
♫  The words I timidly spoke after kissing your trembling lips  ♫

65
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,660

66
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,400

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,650
Min Ji and Woo Chan don't have a lot of screen time.

68
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,040
There's no development, either.

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,420
I think we need some kind of impact.

70
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,970
Oh, Hyungnim, please sit down.

71
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,310
I'll just sit at the end today.

72
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,790
Does anyone have a good idea?

73
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,700
How about a school uniform date?

74
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,280
School uniform?

75
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,910
There was a big gap between the members of each couple during the double date,

76
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,220
so I thought it'd be nice if they could interact like real friends.

77
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,120
There are many couples who go on dates wearing school uniforms these days.

78
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,630
That's right. My boyfriend and I wore school uniforms this weekend and took sticker photos,

79
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,230
and it was more fun than we expected.

80
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,720
That's why...

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,970
we went and got Manna High's school uniform.

82
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,410
- Ta-da! 
 - Ta-da!

83
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,590
But how can we wear school uniforms at this age?

84
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,870
Hyungnim?

85
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,270
- Huh? 
 - You're fine with this, right?

86
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,780
T-There's no way I'd be fine...

87
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,580
Right?

88
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,360
It would be difficult, huh?

89
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,730
No, no, no!

90
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,300
Hold on.

91
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,730
I'll still try it on out of consideration for your hard work.

92
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,770
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

93
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,030
Just don't be shocked at how young I look.

94
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,940
At this rate, I don't know what I'll do if I get a school uniform ad offer.

95
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,510
A school uniform ad sounds fun.

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,890
How can you work on variety show programs without a sense of humor?

97
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,860
Let's laugh!

98
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,090
You're the one... who told us to be strict with laughter.

99
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,650
Hyungnim, what's that on your neck?

100
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,460
What? What? Is there something on it?

101
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,960
Take it off. What is it?

102
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,670
- Isn't that... 
 - My gosh!

103
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,320
What?

104
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,780
- Is that... 
 - Whoa, Hyungnim!

105
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,920
What? What is it?

106
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,840
Gosh, no. You're being ridiculous.

107
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,630
Your imaginations are all...

108
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,380
Keep working.

109
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,990
Just keep working.

110
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,760
You're all being ridiculous.

111
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,980
A real love mark has been spotted on Kingvely's neck?

112
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,320
Senior, do you know anything about this?

113
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,980
That went down the wrong pipe.

114
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,610
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

115
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,520
- I don't want to leave. 
 - Someone's coming.

116
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,090
Was life always this beautiful?

117
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,050
What the heck?

118
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,410
He's so cute.

119
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,380
Senior!

120
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,610
- Senior. 
 - Oh, hey, Sang Eun.

121
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,640
- What is it? 
 - Did you see this?

122
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
What is it?

123
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,310

124
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,260
I thought we were going to get caught.

125
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,540
Wang Kyeong Tae, you were two-timing me?

126
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,840
No!

127
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,200
I don't know what this is about, either.

128
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,470
I'm so dumbfounded by this.

129
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,940
I think Wol Sook had a hand in this once again.

130
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,410
Hello, Reporter!

131
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,410
Yes, what slipped out during my drunken live broadcast must've made the headlines.

132
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,740
I never mentioned any names.

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,790
How should we resolve the problem this time?

134
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,250
We can publish a correction and explain.

135
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,760
I can ask Soon Shim to—

136
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,550
Actually...

137
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,010
Why don't we come up with a strategy since things ended up this way?

138
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,400
A strategy?

139
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,640
Yeah! Our program's receiving a lot of publicity because of this dating scandal.

140
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,940
And?

141
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,500
Let's just watch it play out for now.

142
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,610
But only until our program receives enough publicity.

143
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,550
Must we go that far?

144
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,630
Look at this.

145
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,860
Kingvely even shows up as a related search.

146
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,170
Even so, this is a bit...

147
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,080
You and I both need to do well this time. Right?

148
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,410
The premiere is right around the corner,

149
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,310
so the matter at hand takes priority first.

150
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,210
I don't know.

151
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,870
I should go back for now. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?

152
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,150
See you tomorrow.

153
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,070
I'm leaving.

154
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,410
I'm really leaving.

155
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,050
Don't be upset.

156
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,580
I'm really leaving.

157
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,020
 Kyeong Tae, I'm filming content for my channel tonight.

158
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,500
 Could you help me out?

159
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,280
 Meet me at my house.

160
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,780
"At my house"?

161
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,830
What the heck? Isn't this too fast?

162
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,140
What should I do?

163
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,240
Oh, you're here?

164
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,450
Hi, Kyeong Tae.

165
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,650
So this is Kingvely's house.

166
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,290
It's so nice.

167
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,210
I was fine with meeting outside.

168
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,430
- You haven't eaten yet, right? 
 - Yeah.

169
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,990
Sit tight for a moment.

170
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,450
Oh, can I look around the house in the meantime?

171
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,970
Make yourself at home as you look around. I'll call you later.

172
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,540
Oh, my. That chandelier!

173
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,900
How much could it be?

174
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,830
His house is clean, but it's too empty.

175
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,570
Like someone who's moving soon.

176
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,110
What's that?

177
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,190
You made all this yourself?

178
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,300
No, I ordered them.

179
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,920
Huh?

180
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,810
Leaving it to the professionals is always a good idea.

181
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,610
Go ahead and eat.

182
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,170
Okay.

183
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,370
Kyeong Tae, did you see it by any chance?

184
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,930
The dating scandal article?

185
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,620
Yeah.

186
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,740
I think people exaggerated what I said during my live broadcast,

187
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,330
but how about growing closer through this opportunity?

188
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,540
We have a lot in common, too.

189
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,400
In what regard?

190
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,810
We have our own expertise, passion, and recognition.

191
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,310
Oh, and we always obtain what we want.

192
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,020
Is there something you want from me?

193
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,370
Can't you tell... what it is?

194
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,000
Wol Sook, do you like people who are similar to you?

195
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,090
Huh?

196
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,030
I don't like people who are similar to me.

197
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,190
Why do you like me?

198
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,880
Huh?

199
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,530
Oh, that's...

200
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,430
The pathetic boy next door in whom you had zero interest in the past

201
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,740
became the CEO of a company, became famous, and looks different than before.

202
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,150
Which is what kindled your curiosity, right?

203
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,810
Yeah, I'll admit it.

204
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,530
But aren't all people the same?

205
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,810
You're right. But you know...

206
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:01,090
I thought I would be the same, but I wasn't quite there yet.

207
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,430
Then, what kind of person do you like?

208
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,590
Someone who's the polar opposite of me.

209
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,420
Someone who's not calculative, can't hold a poker face,

210
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,650
and someone who believes in sincerity over strategy.

211
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,070
Someone who doesn't give up despite having a hard time...

212
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,980
and suffering a loss every time.

213
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,230
What has Young Shim ever done for you?

214
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,580
How is she any different from me?

215
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,680
Wol Sook,

216
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,800
you've never genuinely liked someone before, have you?

217
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,150
You think love is a game.

218
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,430
You capture and win your opponent.

219
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,540
Someone wins, and someone loses, and one of them holds the authority.

220
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,050
An alpha and a beta are created.

221
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,010
Is that so bad?

222
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,320
I had a similar mindset at one time.

223
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,020
But I don't think it suits me.

224
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,960
So you shouldn't try so hard, either.

225
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,060
Kyeong Tae, a child's first love won't last forever.

226
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,630
Give me some of your love, too.

227
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,180
You're mistaking your competitiveness as your feelings for me.

228
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,200
Would you have liked me even if I was... still the same Kyeong Tae from the past?

229
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,420

230
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,390

231
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,620
 Did you receive the quarterly report?

232
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,050
 Please let me know when you will come back and I'll set up the meeting with Mr. Stark.

233
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,990
Oh Young Shim, we really don't have much time left.

234
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,550

235
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,500
No.

236
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,830
Let's focus on the program for now.

237
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,960
We're even gaining publicity without lifting a finger.

238
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,430
I'll take this as a blessing from the heavens.

239
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,410
We must do really well this time, so I just need to work harder.

240
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,060
Yeah.

241
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,550
- Senior. 
 - Yeah, you're here?

242
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,090
You must be tired.

243
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,380
It's okay.

244
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,650
Should I help you with the rest?

245
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,880
It's fine.

246
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,070
I'm so excited right now that I'm not tired at all.

247
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,970
Our "Love Mark" needs to do well.

248
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,080
Senior, you even agreed to wear the school uniform.

249
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,580
You're the best.

250
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,530
Not just uniforms.

251
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:32,510
If it's for our program I could even sing and dance in the middle of Gangnam.

252
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,930
Senior, you're even willing to go on a double date with the guy

253
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,600
who aims to get revenge on you.

254
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,170
Your patience is incredible.

255
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,580
Well, it's just business.

256
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,390
I really want to do well this time.

257
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,480
But do you still not think much of CEO Wang?

258
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,000
His personality might be lacking, but he's attractive.

259
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,340
Hey, no way.

260
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,310
I hate those types of men.

261
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,660
And we don't know if he'll stab us in the back again.

262
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,320
We're just helping each other.

263
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,910
It's beneficial for his company, and our program needs to do well, too.

264
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,880
So you shouldn't worry about it.

265
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,260
Right, since people don't change easily.

266
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,490
Right.

267
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,170
Then, should we really try to get CEO Wang and Wol Sook together?

268
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,290
G-Get them together?

269
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:35,420
Since it ended up like this, we could have CEO Wang and Wol Sook go on the next date.

270
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,300
You don't like the idea?

271
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,370
I think it sounds good.

272
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,110
It sounds good.

273
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,030
I think it'll be good.

274
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,800
If it's for our program,

275
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,810
I'd be willing to sing them a celebratory song in a wedding hall.

276
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,740
Really?

277
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,190
Why, of course.

278
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,900
 There's no hotter issue than the formation of a workplace couple in dating programs.

279
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,850
Isn't there a more provocative way to word this?

280
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,730
We really need to do well this time.

281
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,790
I said I'm fine, Sang Eun.

282
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,930
Kyeong Tae!

283
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,580
What am I to you?

284
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,630
What?

285
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,030
You value the program over me, don't you?

286
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,960
What are you talking about?

287
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:53,440
I'm asking you if other people's feelings... don't matter if it's for this program.

288
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,150
What's wrong?

289
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,710
Is this because of the scandal?

290
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,870
Or because of what I said in the car?

291
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,410
I told you it's for work. Why are you acting immature?

292
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,180
Immature?

293
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,430
Yeah, immature.

294
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,180
You don't know why I remain here, do you?

295
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,440
You're always like this. Your feelings come first.

296
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,030
At any rate, we started this program for Kingvely.

297
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,810
Just as Kingvely is important to you, this program is important to me, too.

298
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,050
The circumstances then and now... are different.

299
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,380
What's different?

300
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,160
I was the problem again.

301
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,330
I was the only sincere one.

302
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,470
If that's the case, I'll stop here.

303
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,160
Wait, Kyeong Tae—

304
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,300
I mean...

305
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,270
Wait...

306
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,930
Yes, Chief.

307
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,770
 The edit for the viewing is ready for tomorrow, right?

308
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,140
Yes, I'm in the editing room. I'm editing that right now.

309
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,020
 The president has high expectations.

310
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,480
Yes, I'm preparing diligently.

311
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,460
I'll do my best. Yes.

312
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,190
Okay.

313
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,670
I mean...

314
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,740
Let's put out the fire first.

315
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,400
You're leaving this soon?

316
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,650
I'm disappointed you're leaving so suddenly, Kyeong Tae.

317
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,340
It's fine.

318
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,010
Thank you for everything.

319
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,300
Hey, why do you sound like someone going far away?

320
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,790
I'm going to be quite busy for the time being.

321
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,810
Being busy is good news for a young man.

322
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,850
CEO Wang, fighting!

323
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,530
All right, our CEO is quite busy, so we'll leave first.

324
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,630
Sure, take care.

325
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,290
Okay, I'll be in touch.

326
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,520
Come again!

327
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,260
- I'll be in touch! 
 - Okay.

328
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,200
CEO Wang.

329
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,410
I reserved your flight ticket.

330
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,160
Thanks.

331
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,910
You're really leaving tomorrow?

332
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,640
Yeah.

333
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,620
Hey, you're home.

334
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,650
Wang Kyeong Tae left? Without even telling me?

335
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,620
You didn't know?

336
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,730
I mean...

337
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,350
We did argue, but still...

338
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,310
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep...

339
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,190
Why isn't he picking up?

340
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,520
Oh Soon Shim, why isn't your boss picking up?

341
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,750
I'm flabbergasted.

342
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,150
 Let's end it here.

343
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,770
"End it here"?

344
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,370
What in the world?

345
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,920
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail...

346
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,700
Huh? Why did he turn off his phone? What's going on?

347
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,410
Wait.

348
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,290
Did I just get dumped?

349
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,640
End it here?

350
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,830
Fine! Leave.

351
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,840
He does whatever he wants.

352
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,030
Fine, leave!

353
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,620
I'm free!

354
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,780
Oh Young Shim!

355
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,550
How much did you have to drink alone?

356
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,660
Look at this.

357
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,440
He ended it with this one line.

358
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,420
Where exactly is "here"?

359
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,490
You're the expert, so analyze it for me.

360
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,810
I wondered how happy you two would be after he treated me like that.

361
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,530
Here.

362
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,760
It's true that there are no experts in relationships and stocks.

363
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,900
Huh?

364
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,300
Hey, Oh Young Shim. Kyeong Tae humiliated me even worse because of you!

365
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,440
Humiliated? You were?

366
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,810
I don't understand why,

367
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,060
but Wang Kyeong Tae's brain structure is built around Oh Young Shim.

368
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,040
 Youngsimi?

369
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,790

370
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,300
 Your name is Youngsimi?

371
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,630
It's sickening. So sickening.

372
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,850
He couldn't forget about Young Shim for 20 years.

373
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,640
Then why...

374
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,520
Then why?

375
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,900
I made a Messi-level blunder, and you still ended up like this.

376
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,090
Hey, Oh Young Shim. Get it together!

377
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,270
Forget it.

378
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,420
I should drink and get it together.

379
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,080
Let's drink together.

380
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,410
We got dumped together, so let's drink together.

381
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,670
I'm so annoyed because of you two, too.

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm annoyed, too!

383
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,830
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

384
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,360
Don't cry.

385
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,430
Don't cry!

386
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,600
Kim Min Ji.

387
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,880
Are you calling me?

388
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,850
Is there another Kim Min Ji here beside you?

389
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,500
Why did you call me?

390
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,450
Can you get in touch with PD Young Shim?

391
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,270
No.

392
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,760
I got a weird text from Kyeong Tae yesterday.

393
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,780
 I'm leaving.

394
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,030
 Don't end up like me and just find another girlfriend.

395
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,650
I think... this is our cue to take action.

396
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,310
Take action?

397
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,200
 For Oh Young Shim to have her wish granted.

398
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,420
 For Oh Young Shim to have her wish granted.

399
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,170
 For Oh Young Shim to have her wish granted.

400
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,970
What an asshole.

401
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,170
You selfish bastard.

402
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,930
You said that's all you needed.

403
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,580
Seriously, I'm totally lost here, too.

404
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,500

Unni, please help me out one last time.

405
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,990

- It's urgent!  
 - What?

406
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,130
Gosh!  What is it this time?

407
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,440
Thank you.

408
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,820
Woo Chan is going to the U.S. all of a sudden?

409
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,750
Where's Min Ji? She said she'd be waiting here.

410
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,940
What made you want to help them out?

411
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,770
I got a hint from the teddy bear.

412
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
Why are you here?

413
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,610
Where are you going?

414
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,990
The time for my flight is soon.

415
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,550
You're really leaving like this?

416
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,610
You'll really insist on doing this?

417
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,160
You coward!

418
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,770
Go ahead! Keep running away like that!

419
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,460
Yes. I might run away again at a crucial moment.

420
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,650
Yes. Keep running all you want.

421
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,720
I'll chase you all the way to hell.

422
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,520
Is this still not enough?

423
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,570
You like me, too, don't you?

424
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,590
Me as of now can't like Oh Young Shim again.

425
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,530
I thought I had changed...

426
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,860
but I think I'm seeing again

427
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,850
the wounds I thought healed after starting to like you again.

428
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,840
I also hate myself for being like this.

429
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,430
What a loser.

430
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,890
You're right.

431
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,820
That's who I am. I can't help it.

432
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,040
If you really leave like this... you'll regret it for life.

433
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,680
If, by chance, I'm able to change...

434
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,550
I'll come back.

435
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,810
Though I don't know when it'll be.

436
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,120
Did I say I'll accept you if you come back?

437
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,450
You're really the worst.

438
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,260
If you were going to be like this... why did you show up in front of me again?

439
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,080
 All passengers headed to New York, please enter through gate 3 at this time.

440
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,070
You're done, right?

441
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,650
I'll go now.

442
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:23,760
If you really leave like this, we're done!

443
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,750
Wang Kyeong Tae! We're finished!

444
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,870
♫  I'm calling for you and your name only  ♫

445
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,270
I said, we're done...

446
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:40,350
If you leave, we're really done...

447
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:46,840
♫  I look back at the sight of you looking at me  ♫

448
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,790
 It seems like the most shameful moment... of my life hasn't come yet.

449
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:58,010
♫  The entire world is being colored in white  ♫

450
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:11,140
♫  When I hold your hand, it feels like a flower blooms in my heart  ♫

451
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,850
 While he was putting off matters in the U.S.

452
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,610
 because he wanted to finish the show with you,

453
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,290

it looks like things got worse suddenly.

454
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,740
 I think that's why Kyeong Tae left in a hurry.

455
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,290
♫  If I can be with you every step of the way  ♫

456
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:33,350
♫  I'll fly away like the drifting petals  ♫

457
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,450
♫  I'm calling for you  ♫

458
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,510

459
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,350
Hey, Young Shim's new show is starting.

460
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,580

461
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,490
Man, I hope Young Shim's show gets a good view rating this time.

462
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,920
Did she say things are going well?

463
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,880
Nope.

464
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,730
She said this one's a bigger hit lately.

465
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,890
H-Hey, hey-

466
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,240
"Lust Island"?

467
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,190
PD Chae Dong was determined when he created this.

468
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,670
Lately, this is like... so like...

469
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,430
I mean, it's so like—

470
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,300
 - Whoa!  
  - G-Goodness...

471
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,800
H-Hey, hey, turn the channel. All right?

472
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,640
- Leave it on for a second. 
 - Goodness...

473
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,370
Come on, Father is here, too.

474
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,100
 Chae Dong, who eventually left "Love Mark,"

475
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,580
 ended up creating a sensual R-rated dating show for adults

476
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,010
 after filming documentaries on an island in my place... earning the nickname "PD Lust."

477
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,160

478
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,830
 He even ended up beating our viewer ratings.

479
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,360
Gosh, what the heck?

480
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,650
Hey, Lustful Chae Dong!

481
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,180
Congrats on beating "Love Mark."

482
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,260
 Wol Sook realized the person who desires the same thing she does

483
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,050
 is closer to her than she thought.

484
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,970
 As I thought, she cleverly got what she wanted without changing herself.

485
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:21,020
Final Credits

486
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,930
Final Credits

487
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:33,000
Final Credits

488
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,580
Final Credits

489
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,980
Chae Dong beat you completely, huh?

490
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,610
Yes.

491
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:47,230
I had raised a tiger cub.

492
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,380
You only have the final episode after this week. Right?

493
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,620
Yes.

494
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,760
Try to make up for it somehow.

495
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,460
Still...

496
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,490
Will I be able to beat a bikini party on an island?

497
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,410
At this rate...

498
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,810
no matter how good the reviews are... Season 2 isn't guaranteed.

499
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,690
You know that, right?

500
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,600
Yes.

501
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,200
Fighting!

502
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
Fighting!

503
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll get going now.

504
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,200
Hold your chin up!

505
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,250
Don't we have a more intense and twisted story?

506
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,520
No, they're all more or less the same.

507
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,540
There's no way to beat "Lust Island."

508
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,080
We've got a new applicant.

509
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:58,260
"Though I ended up dating my first love after going round and round for years...

510
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,300
we ended up breaking up again because of my mistake.

511
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,270
Though I'm trash who ghosted her twice,

512
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,120
I want to ask her for forgiveness one more time.

513
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,570
Please help me out."

514
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,510
It's a ghosting breakup story.

515
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,060
What do you think about this one?

516
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,840
That won't do.

517
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,440
Trash that ghosts you can't even be recycled.

518
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,040
Still, why don't we hear the details?

519
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,580
It sucks. Let's look for someone else.

520
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,780
Let's call it a day here. You're all free to go.

521
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,970
- Yes. 
  - Okay.

522
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,110
Why am I in such a shitty mood?

523
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,590
It's definitely not because of Wang Kyeong Tae.

524
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,450
Oh Young Shim!

525
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,460
I'm even hearing things now, huh?

526
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,420
Oh Young Shim, pull yourself together.

527
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,950
Young Shim.

528
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,250
Wang Kyeong Tae?

529
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,080
Young Shim...

530
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,300
I'm back...

531
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,590
Young Shim.

532
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,430
Have you been well?

533
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,070
I got it.

534
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,300
I'll go.

535
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,130
Don't go.

536
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,820
I thought something happened to you.

537
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:45,840
Even if you tell me to leave... I'll stay by your side forever.

538
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,310
If you leave without a word again,

539
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,150
I'll chase you down to the ends of the earth.

540
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,550
I'm too scared to run away now.

541
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,530
Now, you're smiling.

542
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,710
I'm not.

543
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,790
That's the Oh Young Shim I know.

544
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,970
♫  I came all this way  ♫

545
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,020
You need another beating.

546
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:39,030
♫  What can't be erased doesn't go the way I want  ♫

547
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:44,180
♫  I can't bring myself to stop you, and I can't even look away  ♫

548
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,770
♫  Because I keep missing you  ♫

549
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:56,610
♫  Because you're like an unforgettable dream  ♫

550
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,950
I'm home!

551
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,520
Hi.

552
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,640
Oh, my. K-Kyeong Tae!

553
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,650
Wh-What in the world is going on?

554
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,620
You look homeless now.

555
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,050
You're right. I'm homeless now.

556
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,310
There was a problem at the U.S. headquarters, so I sold all my shares and subsidiaries.

557
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,350
Once I gave out my employees' severance pay,

558
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,420
I wasn't left with a single penny.

559
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,550
Y-You're... really broke now?

560
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,470
Yes, Father.

561
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:42,200
I have to start from the beginning again.

562
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,860
Will you still accept this... penniless beggar?

563
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,460
Huh?

564
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,470
Oh, that's...

565
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,600
something you should ask Young Shim.

566
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,960
Unni...

567
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,110
Sounds good.

568
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,720
I'll feed you until you make a comeback.

569
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,520
This is nothing compared to 20 years.

570
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,380
Young Shim...

571
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,920
But on one condition.

572
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,600
- Condition? 
 - Yeah.

573
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,800
 - First. Move into our home as the son-in-law.  
 - I just need to connect this.

574
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,760
 Kyeong Tae! I need water.

575
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,560
Water?

576
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,560
Okay, water!

577
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,320
Water, water. Here you go.

578
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,570
Oh, thank you.

579
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,630
Where are the three ice cubes I like?

580
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,100
- Ice? 
 - Yeah.

581
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,680
Okay, ice! Ice, ice, ice. Freeze...

582
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,380
Unfreeze! Ice, ice, ice.

583
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,690
 Second. No disappearing without a word.

584
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,680
Where were you for the past 30 minutes?

585
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,350
I went to exercise for a moment.

586
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,550
Did you forget that unreported action is one of the reasons for eviction?

587
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,530
Sorry.

588
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,410
And do you even have the time to exercise right now?

589
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,140
When are you going to make a comeback spending your time jobless?

590
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,970
And when will you succeed?

591
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,640
Okay, okay. If you're done exercising, go back to your workroom.

592
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,330
- Yes! 
 - Work hard!

593
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,650
Young Shim, take it easy on him.

594
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,860
I feel so bad for Kyeong Tae.

595
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,000
Kyeong Tae's the one who chose this path.

596
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:00,370
 And being by my side before I even have to call you.

597
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,890
Young Shim.

598
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,590
Yeah?

599
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,610
You're ready to be a part of my shameful past for the rest of your life, right?

600
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,700

601
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,750
Whoa. Young Shim's lines are so tough.

602
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,580
She told him to be a part of her shameful past for life.

603
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,370
- Oh, gosh. 
 - Wow!

604
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:54,420
I drew it and wrote it, but this is embarrassing.

605
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,100
Why? You don't know how popular girl crushes are these days.

606
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,700
Many women propose first these days.

607
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,660
Ji Yoo, you're the one who uploaded Father's drawings to the internet?

608
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,830
I saw them coincidentally, and they were more entertaining than I expected.

609
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,500
Good job. Good job!

610
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,820
My daughter's so smart!

611
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,610
Huh? Wait a minute...

612
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:17,660
What? Why?

613
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,050
This is getting more views than I expected.

614
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,230
What if we have to start the series officially again?

615
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,810
Huh?

616
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,370
What do we do?

617
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,600
Wait, Father!

618
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,330
- We paid off our debts last time! 
 - Wh-What?

619
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,370
Debts are the least of our worries right now.

620
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,350
Father, do you want anything?

621
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,130
I mean, my back and shoulders hurt these days.

622
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,880
A massage chair wouldn't hurt.

623
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,970
A massage chair! A massage chair sounds nice.

624
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,180
It looks like... you two were the only ones who benefited from this.

625
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,700
I'm sorry.

626
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,630
You can do better next time. Right?

627
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,980
Next time?

628
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,540
Love Mark Season 2.

629
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,390
In return... it'll be the divorced couples' edition.

630
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,460
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

631
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,410
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

632
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,020
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

633
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,010
Yay!

634
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:34,250
♫  I want to see you, and I want to hear you  ♫

635
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:38,320
Dad, you need to include that we're planning Season 2. Okay?

636
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,730
No one cares about that except you.

637
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,640
No, our fans are all waiting.

638
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,260
And draw me pretty. I'm the female protagonist.

639
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,120
People these days like to see you as you are.

640
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,700
Hey, what's that?

641
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,340
Come on. How do you do this? Erase it.

642
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,290
 And that's how my past 20 years and relationship at 34 years old

643
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,370
 were revealed to the world again.

644
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,080
 But that didn't matter.

645
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,820
 If even one person can be happy, thanks to my shameful past.

646
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:23,580
 In the muddy water of our shameful pasts... we're all born as a shining pearl.

647
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,150
This is the robot vacuum Kyeong Tae made?

648
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,330
Should we test it out, then?

649
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,730
Young Shim, clean up.

650
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,850
Young Shim, move.

651
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,800
Young Shim, good job.

652
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,030
Young Shim, charge.

653
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,960
What the? There's no reaction.

654
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,710
Young Shim, I love you.

655
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,960

656
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,460

657
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,110
♫  You've done great so far  ♫

658
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:20,680
♫  I'll carry the burden on your shoulders with you from now  ♫

659
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:28,710
♫  The countless mountains you overcame prove you've been doing great  ♫

660
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:33,720
♫  Of course, it's okay to take a break  ♫

661
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,290
♫  You have the right to do that  ♫

662
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:47,680
♫  You can bury your face in your sleeves and cry all you want  ♫

663
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,100
♫  When things don't go as you wish and when you want to fall to the ground  ♫

664
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:57,160
♫  Try screaming out until you feel better  ♫

665
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,340
♫  To yourself from yesterday, who must have gone through a lot  ♫

666
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,690
♫  I'll give you a hug  ♫

667
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:12,480
