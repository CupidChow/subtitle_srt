00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,150
I'm suddenly reminded of back then.

9
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,440
Don't you remember...

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,300
Young Shim?

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,280

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,110

Oh, my.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,620
I think I've seen this scene from somewhere.

 One episode of contents...

 Kingvely's AI will create the matching orders and old-school retro themes for each date.

 Goo Wol Sook and Wang Kyeong Tae, congratulations!

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,840
 I'll go at once.

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,940
 I want to...

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,690
 have a lovely relationship with someone who has a king-size company.

31
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:21,000

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,030
Gosh, seriously.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,360
Gosh, it's so funny.

34
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,310
     Romantic, businessman, and successful.

35
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,050
 You're... the Wang Kyeong Tae I know, right?

36
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,630
 Wol Sook, let me ask you for a favor.

37
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,670
 A favor?

38
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,240
 Until the final date, please pretend not to know me.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
 Why?

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,160
 Is there any reason for that?

41
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,960
 Not really.

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,950
 I just want it to be that way.

43
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,770
 All right.

44
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,560
 Instead, there's a condition.

45
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,440
 What is it?

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,250
 During the final selections, pick me.

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,100
 That's my condition for keeping your secret.

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,780
 "Love Lines" final couple is here.

49
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,990
 Goo Wol Sook and Wang Kyeong Tae, congratulations!

50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,840
Oh, my.

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,620
I think I've seen this scene from somewhere.

52
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,830
 Just what the heck is Young Shim?

53
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,650
 Young Shim used to bully Kyeong Tae, who followed her around.

54
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,400
 That Kyeong Tae is Kingvely? Wow.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,960

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,100

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
 There was a background story to this.

58
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,060
 I knew it was like that ever since.

59
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,320
 Kyeong Tae's revenge starts now.

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,590
 Did the tables turn on Young Shim?

61
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,570

62
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,920
We got the highest viewer ratings among this week's programs, huh?

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,610
I should've made Young Shim go on the show from the beginning.

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,750
Her potential shines here, huh?

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,010
Seriously.

66
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,710
It came out way better than what we expected.

67
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:25,530
Hey! If it's this good, wouldn't it be turned into a regular program?

68
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,860
- Really? 
 - Yes.

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,060
Hey, wait a second.

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,680
At this important moment, where did Oh Young Shim go?

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,930
Oh, Senior Young Shim took a sick day because she wasn't feeling well.

72
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,540
Gosh, this little...

73
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,980
We should be celebrating with a toast right now.

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,620
A sick day? Huh?

75
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,370
Why? Is she really sick or something?

76
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,540
Wang Kyeong Tae, you bastard...

77
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,860
 Whoa! Wh-Whoa!

78
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,240
And those show business bastards...

79
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,600
I told them so many times to cut out the vomiting part!

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,200
They put a slow motion here?

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,930
Gosh, they've got no respect for their senior or any sense of humanity.

82
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,010
They're viewer-rate diggers who are just like Wang Kyeong Tae.

83
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,150

Senior, Chief said the vomiting scene must be included.

84
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,080
 I'm sorry.

85
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,260
Lee Chae Dong, you're just the same.

86
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,630
I'm done for!

87
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,330
I'm done for...

88
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,570

89
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,390
♫  Put everything back  ♫

90
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,370
♫  the way they were  ♫ 
 Capture...

91
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,620
It came out nicely. Very nice.

92
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,110
Gosh, that's a relief.

93
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,660
Looks like I won't need digestive meds today.

94
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,870
Great.

95
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,380
Huh?

96
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,990
What's this?

97
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,350
 I've never seen such a ridiculous show before.

98
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,680
 - Why air such a program? 
 - Huh? How's this a dating show?

99
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,270
Why are they being this mean?

100
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,910
 What?

101
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,890
He jumped in?

102
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,610
Why?

103
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,330
What's this?

104
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,780
♫  One means one, not two  ♫

105
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,530
 I need to keep a look eye, so Youngsim won't fall for someone else.

106
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,060
♫  Three means three, it doesn't mean four  ♫

107
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,360
♫  It doesn't mean five  ♫

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,610
 Gosh, really? I wanted to watch that movie as well.

109
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,400
 - I'd love to. 
  - Goo Wol Sook...

110
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
 That sly wench!

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,880
 Why is she with the guy I had in mind?

112
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,120
 I need to come up with a plan. Just wait.

113
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,210
 P-Please help me!

114
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,550
 Please help!

115
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,480
 P-Please help!

116
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,010
 I-It's too deep-

117
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,020
 Youngsim! It's dangerous!

118
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,800
 - Youngsim! 
 - Y-Youngsim-

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,130
 Youngsim first!

120
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,320
 Please save Youngsim first!

121
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,680
How do you do?

122
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,860
My name is Oh Ha Yoon, your new secretary starting today officially.

123
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,760
Yes. Please sit over here.

124
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,400
CEO Wang, first of all...

125
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,290
I'll report to you on the current increase in Kingvely's sales right after the broadcast.

126
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,310
"Love Lines" took first place among its peers, based on the capital area.

127
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,410
Kingvely's sales increased by an average of 138% before and after the broadcast.

128
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,030
It marked the highest viewer rating at the end of the show and a maximum of 208%

129
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,040
- of its effect on sales— 
 - No need to report things like this...

130
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,110
Soon Shim.

131
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,100
Yes, CEO Wang.

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,580
You... knew I was Soon Shim all along?

133
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,900
I knew from the beginning.

134
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,850
What's the use of changing your name? You look just the same.

135
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,390
Still, I'll call you Oh Ha Yoon at work.

136
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,190
Don't worry about it.

137
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,460
Gosh, I got goosebumps!

138
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,760
That's why I pretended not to know.

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,980
Okay.

140
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,570
I'll also pretend not to know.

141
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,950
Also...

142
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,740
the broadcast was fun, CEO Wang.

143
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,750
What about Young Shim? How is she?

144
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,200
Is she doing well?

145
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,330
Well, you buried her properly.

146
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,970
You know what broadcasts are like.

147
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,690
I fully and surely realized this time that when...

148
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,730
a man holds a grudge, it's way scarier than when a woman—

149
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,370
Never mind.

150
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,530
Please excuse me now as I must go back to my duties as a secretary.

151
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,570
Yes, Chief Heo.

152
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,350
Is it thanks to your name, Mark Wang?

153
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,570
The viewer ratings are really making a mark.

154
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,090
This is all thanks to you, CEO Wang.

155
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,420
You're more popular than most celebs.

156
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,660
So while we're on the topic, don't you want to

157
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,610
join me on a variety show that's on the board right now?

158
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,800
A variety show?

159
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,320
It looks like Kingvely is key to everything.

160
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,130
Let's do one together! I heard Kingvely also benefited from the show.

161
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,640
Let me also benefit from Kingvely, please!

162
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,210
That's...

163
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,600
Well...

164
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,090
Is there a problem?

165
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,020
If I do decide to join, who will be in charge?

166
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,400
Oh, yes, yes.

167
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,320
Don't even worry for a bit.

168
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,890
I'll get you a clever and competent PD, not Young Shim.

169
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,740
Young Shim has...

170
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,560
served her purpose, sort of speak.

171
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,910
Chae Dong! Come in for a second.

172
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,570
 Yes.

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,710
He's our station's next-in-line ace in the sleeve.

174
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,160
- Take a seat. 
 - Yes.

175
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,690
Oh, right.

176
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,940
You two already know each other, right?

177
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,930
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

178
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,140
That's great! You have already worked with each other once.

179
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,890
What about PD Oh Young Shim?

180
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,830
Oh, yes. Young Shim?

181
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,140
She might not be able to keep working here...

182
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,400
since she's become the...

183
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,420
National Zero Votes. 
  ("Young" means zero in Korean)

184
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,800
Young is zero votes, and zero votes are Young Shim.

185
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,380
Young Shim is forever and ever...

186
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,940
I don't know where she got the guts, but she took a sick day.

187
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,590
Some people are saying she's going to quit.

188
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,240
Right, Chae Dong?

189
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,910
Yes, well...

190
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,240
Senior Young Shim is someone who keeps her word.

191
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,960
Hey, hey. Hey.

192
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,970
You should convince Young Shim since you're her sidekick.

193
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,050
Sidekick?

194
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,700
By chance, if you quit along with Young Shim...

195
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,010
you're dead to me. You got that?

196
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,370
Gosh, Chief Heo, come on!

197
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,060
Right, Chief. Please excuse me. I've got a meeting to go to.

198
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,100
Sure, go ahead. Yes, go on.

199
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,400
Is that PD and PD Oh Young Shim close?

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,310
Close?

201
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,820
I'm sure they're something more than that.

202
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,660
Right. I think they're always together, except when they're

203
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,550
using the bathroom and sleeping.

204
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,000
Always together?

205
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,810
Right, PD Lee!

206
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,220
Oh, yes, Wang Kyeong Tae.

207
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,690
What's the matter?

208
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,790
 "Wang Kyeong Tae"?

209
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,800
That's right, Lee Chae Dong.

210
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,320
I didn't get to say thanks to you last time.

211
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,450
Thank you for last time.

212
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,030
Well, Senior Young Shim did all the hard work.

213
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,930
Now, then.

214
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,780
Excuse me!

215
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,090
Have you worked with PD Oh for a long time?

216
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,580
Why are you curious about that?

217
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,770
Well, it was only out of curiosity.

218
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,900
But you're being really sensitive about it.

219
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,610
We've been on the same team for only a year...

220
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,400
but I love her.

221
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,360
L... Love?

222
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,800
I think density matters more in a relationship than length of time.

223
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,650
Did someone ask?

224
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,160
But why are you telling me that?

225
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,780
You're right.

226
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,610
Why did I?

227
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,360
All right, then.

228
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,690
He's totally a nutcase.

229
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,440
 I love her.

230
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,770
 I love her.

231
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,360
 I love her.

232
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
Gosh, no, no.

233
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,000
No, that can't be.

234
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,820
Now's not the time to be concerned with these things.

235
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,900
Love?

236
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,910

237
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,360
What should I name it?

238
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,190
Shall I check how Kingvely feels?

239
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,040
 Am I the only one scared from watching the show?

240
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,650
 Even though he's our CEO, he's such a loser.

241
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,950
 He's so petty.

242
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,240
 She seemed really moved at the end.

243
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,580
 He just made a fool out of Young Shim.

244
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,180
 Even so, it's only a show. Don't believe anyone.

245
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,680
 It's just like the rumor says.

246
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,640
 Gosh, will anyone even be brave enough to date Mark?

247
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,830
 He's still a successful CEO.

248
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,310
 You don't worry about those people.

249
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,700
 But I thought Wang Kyeong Tae was also going to choose Young Shim.

250
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,280
 Oh my god! Now you mention it, Young Shim did choose Wang Kyeong Tae.

251
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,340
 Did Young Shim like Kyeong Tae?

252
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,070

253
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,370

254
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,730

255
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,420

256
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,040

257
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,940
Oh Young Shim...

258
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,360
Why did she choose me?

259
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,300
 Could I see those headphones for a second?

260
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,290

What are you doing right now? Give it back.

261
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,250
 Seriously.

262
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,580
Whatever.

263
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,380
I'll just give it a go.

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
I know this is the one.

265
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,610
Kiddo, what are you doing?

266
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,080
Wh-What did you capture?

267
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,320
Y-You can't just be taking pictures of people like that.

268
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,640
You aren't completely undressed yet, huh?

269
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,520
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,420
Why don't you explain yourself if you're not guilty?

271
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,730
What are you peeking at over the walls?

272
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,940
It's not like that!

273
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,260
Lee Ji Yoo, what are you doing there?

274
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,110
I caught a flasher, Mom!

275
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,800
You f***ing bastard!

276
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,470
You bastard.

277
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,290
Honey, I caught him. I did.

278
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,980
My head...

279
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,420
Wh-Whoa, wait a minute.

280
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,980
O-Oh my, c-could you be...

281
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,130
That's right.

282
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm Kyeong Tae.

283
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,170
Hey, you look way better in person.

284
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,160
My goodness, I didn't even know it was you.

285
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,530
For that midget from back then—

286
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,610
I mean, the cute little boy to have succeeded like this...

287
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,440
Gosh! You're so cool!

288
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,500
You should've told us before coming, though.

289
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,520
What brought you here?

290
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,160
Well, I was starting to miss my old neighborhood when I came back to Korea from the U.S.

291
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,490
That's why I was also reminded of you all, too.

292
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,420
Sure, you did the right thing!

293
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,080
We're all still the same. Right?

294
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,820
Yes, yes. Sure.

295
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,780
By the way, what about your wife?

296
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,230
Oh, my mom?

297
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,020
She went on a cruise.

298
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,790
She said housewives need sabbaticals or something, too.

299
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,400
And that's why I can't leave this house.

300
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,940
Geez, I wish Mom would come back quickly.

301
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,020
By the way, Kyeong Tae... why didn't you choose our Young Shim?

302
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,780
I was so sad.

303
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,300
Gosh, seriously.

304
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,400
Don't be concerned, Kyeong Tae. No, I mean, CEO Wang.

305
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,450
No, you can just call me Kyeong Tae, Hyungnim.

306
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,010
- Yes, please. 
 - How can I?

307
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,200
Oh, yes! Hyungnim sounds great!

308
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,500
Gosh, then, should I call you Son-in-Law Wang?

309
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,550
Sorry?

310
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,720
Gosh, seriously!

311
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,820
You're all being so rude to our potential son-in-law, who finally came after 20 years!

312
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,930
We'll prepare the dinner right away. So, go in the room and rest, Kyeong Tae.

313
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,050
O-Okay.

314
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,950
Oh, my.

315
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,330
Kyeong Tae— I mean, Son-in-Law Wang, help yourself.

316
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,430
O-Oh, okay.

317
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,910
My goodness... I'll be in your care.

318
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,060
Oh, o-okay.

319
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,240
Hey, where's your aunt?

320
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,120
Senior, you're okay. Right?

321
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,020
I was going to buy you porridge since you're sick.

322
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,160
Your face looks haggard lately, you know.

323
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,370
My face?

324
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,620
I ate some spicy food out of stress lately.

325
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,760
I went to the bathroom a little too often.

326
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,570
I'm fine.

327
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,080
Anyhow, meat is really the only solution to tough times. Right?

328
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,970
I'm going to stuff myself.

329
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,140
Let it cook before you eat.

330
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,940
Everything on here is yours, Senior.

331
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,660
You brought the company card. Right?

332
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,490
Just do this and go. I'm going to eat tons today.

333
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,630
Gosh, I shouldn't have chosen Wang Kyeong Tae, then.

334
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,970
Gosh, seriously.

335
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,950
I was such a fool.

336
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,390
I'll be going home now.

337
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,370
- Sure, take care. 
 - Yes.

338
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,160
Come again.

339
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,990
Daughter!

340
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,840
Secretary Oh...

341
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,990
CEO Wang, why are you here?

342
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,930
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

343
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,030
Please take care.

344
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,420
Young Shim is coming, too.

345
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,430
Great timing.

346
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,250
I'm an embarrassing fool!

347
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,490
What's this?

348
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,040
Why's he here?

349
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,980
I went to the station for work today and got worried when I heard you took a sick day.

350
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,700
Let's forget about the past, and let's get along, Young Shim.

351
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,750
Also, the new variety show we'll be doing together...

352
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,170
Worried, my foot!

353
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,370
If it were you, would you be able to get along again?

354
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,640
Take that!

355
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,180
Tap, tap— Tap!

356
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,870
Stop her! Stop her!

357
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,400
- Gosh... 
 - You!

358
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,230
Kyeong Tae, are you okay?

359
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,070
- Gosh! 
 - What the heck is this?

360
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,990
Don't ever show yourself again.

361
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,900
If you show yourself again...

362
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
I'm going to kick you right in your face!

363
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,430
Gosh, I did that earlier already!

364
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,650
Wh-Whatever the case, don't let me see you ever again!

365
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,250
She's completely crazy.

366
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,400
You're not any different then and now! I'm never coming back!

367
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,330
What? He's still not getting it!

368
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,160
You!

369
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,590
Go inside! Go inside.

370
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,380
- Y-You... 
 - Wh-Whoa, be careful.

371
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,090
- Gosh... 
 - She's insane.

372
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,110
Goodness gracious. Kyeong Tae, are you okay?

373
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,330
Hyungnim...

374
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,230
- I'll be going home now. 
 - Yes, yes.

375
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,890
Gosh, she's crazy.

376
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,100
She's a wacko.

377
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,850
Gosh, Kyeong Tae, make sure to go to the hospital.

378
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,920
Gosh, Young Shim must be crazy!

379
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,660
Oh Young Shim, wake up.

380
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,370
Hey, Oh Young Shim, are you really not going to work?

381
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,340
I'm not. I can't because I'm embarrassed.

382
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,360
Gosh, hey!

383
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,210
Do you know what's really embarrassing?

384
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,450
Throwing someone down to the ground because you're mad and can't behave yourself.

385
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,840
That's what's really embarrassing, you brat!

386
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,120
I finally get to sleep in! What's your deal?

387
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,540
Let me at least sleep as much as I want.

388
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm not eating. I'm not!

389
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,580
Don't f***ing eat, you bitch! Really!

390
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,910
Gosh! What a pain.

391
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,270
Get out! Get out!

392
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,610
- Is Young Shim not eating? 
 - No.

393
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,780
Even if she says she wants to, I'm not letting her.

394
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,990
She got all mad and got all riled up that I woke her up.

395
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,140
I'm sure Young Shim couldn't get a good sleep after what happened yesterday.

396
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,990
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

397
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,790
The one who beat him up got a goodnight's sleep.

398
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,490
She was snoring, too.

399
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,630
But I wonder if Kyeong Tae is okay. His back must feel the shock.

400
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,350
It looks like I gave birth to thugs.

401
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,840
One's a kicker, and the other is a thrower—

402
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,950
It looks like melee combat is in the Oh family's genes.

403
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,770
I'm going to work now.

404
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,690
Soon Shim, please explain things nicely to Kyeong Tae.

405
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,170
I might even get fired because of Sis.

406
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,490
I'll be back.

407
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,710
Bye.

408
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,930
Sorry for the trouble.

409
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,060
What was that about Oh family?

410
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,610
Even dogs don't get bothered when eating.

411
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,320
 Also, the new variety show...

412
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,580
 Worried, my foot!

413
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,760
 Would you be able to get along again?

414
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,900
 Take that!

415
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,080
 Don't ever show yourself again.

416
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,200
 You're not any different then and now!

417
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,090
 I'm never coming back!

418
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,080
A new show?

419
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,050
What's that about?

420
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,300
Never mind.

421
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,890
Let's not worry about anything.

422
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,760
Don't even think about anything related to Wang Kyeong Tae.

423
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,860
What could possibly be new?

424
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,360
Just go back to sleep.

425
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,150

426
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,200

427
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,940

428
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,770

Stop...

429
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,250

Stop! No more...

430
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,410
Stop sending them...

431
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,980
I'm sure it's not my pay.

432
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,040
Oh Young Shim, get up.

433
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,470
You're still a slave.

434
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,570
You're only a modern-day indentured servant...

435
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,250
who hasn't obtained financial freedom.

436
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,620
Get up. You need to go out.

437
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,400
Get up...

438
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,260
Hey, look at this. It's so funny.

439
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,640
Oh, is this that "Love Lines" show?

440
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,800
Yes.

441
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,000
How can you not know this show?

442
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,920
It happens.

443
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,010
 No way.

444
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,660
 Please just eat one egg for me.

445
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,630
Hey, PD Young Shim!

446
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,550
Y-Yes. Hello.

447
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,320
If it's nothing urgent, I'm...

448
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,700
- I also saw the show. 
 - Sorry?

449
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,980
Since a familiar face came out, I watched it to the end.

450
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,120
But even I felt sorry for you in the end.

451
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,960
What's the deal with zero votes? It's not like you were Lee Young Pyo. 
  (Famous soccer player, "young pyo" sounds like zero votes)

452
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,920
O-Okay. Excuse me—

453
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,470
I was really upset, seriously.

454
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,560
I called all my unmarried nephews.

455
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,290
What do you say? Should I set you up?

456
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,590
N-No, it's okay. I'm fine.

457
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,380
O-Okay, take care.

458
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,740
Thank you.

459
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,750

460
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,560

461
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,860
I went out on a show, but why don't I have more new subscribers?

462
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,300

463
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,860
There's no way this is happening.

464
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,500
What if it only ends up benefitting Oh Young Shim?

465
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,880
Amazing!

466
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,680
Wait, really? This is Senior Young Shim?

467
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,310
Gosh, she's so cute.

468
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,210
She looks the same.

469
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,070
Yes, she does. She's so cute.

470
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,570
- What's up? 
 - Oh, Senio!

471
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,860
It was great.

472
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,370
Wow! Are you really Young Shim, Senior?

473
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,180
I didn't know until now!

474
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,390
I watched all episodes of "Youngsim" over the break.

475
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,500
♫  Try it  ♫ 
 What's wrong with you all?

476
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,800
♫  You can make mistakes, it's fine  ♫ 
 Stop. Cut it out.

477
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,210
Be quiet, all of you!

478
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,700
Senior, this means CEO Wang is the little boy with glasses. Right?

479
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,370
Soon Shim— I mean, what does your sister do nowadays?

480
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,770
Do you all still live there together?

481
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,070
- What's the matter? 
 - Senior...

482
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,680
Yo Han also put it on his SNS and got so many views.

483
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,090

484
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,560
What's this? You put this on your SNS? Geez!

485
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
Seriously!

486
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,960
Senior, Chief wants to see you.

487
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,390
Fighting.

488
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,730
Look who we have here.

489
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,120
Why's it so hard to see you around?

490
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,360
All right. Take a seat.

491
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,390
Have a seat.

492
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,330
How are you? Did you get a good rest?

493
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,500
You're being really awkward right now.

494
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,730
Please just do as you always do.

495
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,160
Gosh. You've already become a celeb.

496
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,700
Young Shim the Zero Votes.

497
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:53,200
Even the rhyme is perfect, like a rigged game of poker.

498
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,840
Are you sure this wasn't your big picture, Young Shim?

499
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,370
You said seeing me makes your lifespan decrease.

500
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,160
Please live long.

501
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,260
Hope you live forever, Senior.

502
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,140
Geez, come on. Sit, sit.

503
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,250
Please take a seat, Miss Junior.

504
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,130
You're still mad about it, huh.

505
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,900
Well, what can we do, still?

506
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,430
If I want to be employed for a long time, I need to get on my junior's good side.

507
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,720
Join the new show. It's a regular program this time.

508
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,750
The president gave a special order, saying he commends your spirit of not holding back

509
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,720
even in a critical situation.

510
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,110
I can't believe you, though.

511
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,560
Were you lied to your entire life?

512
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,040
At the end of the year, I'll get you your promotions and

513
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,630
negotiate your salary again.

514
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,640
I'll guarantee this to you in my name.

515
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,560
What kind of a show is it?

516
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:02,590
A new variety show, made by Young Shim and Wang Kyeong Tae together.

517
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,680
How is it?

518
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,100
I told Kingvely everything yesterday already.

519
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,050
 Also, the new variety show we'll be doing together...

520
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,330
 Worried, my foot!

521
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,240
 Take that!

522
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,680
 Just die!

523
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,950
 Tap, tap— Tap!

524
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,980
 That was why he came?

525
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,670
Gosh, but there's a problem now.

526
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,020
I was sure Kingvely would join even until yesterday.

527
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,820
But he suddenly texted me, saying he won't do it.

528
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,900
I don't want to work with that punk, either.

529
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,800
That's not right.

530
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,550
You should, even if you don't want to.

531
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,320
We need Wang Kyeong Tae in order to save you and the show.

532
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,900
What's Wang Kyeong Tae worth?

533
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,670
Is he really that big of a thing?

534
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,100
CEO Wang?

535
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,490
He's the hottest and coolest young and rich in Korea right now.

536
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,930
Cool, my foot.

537
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,090
Wh-Who are you saying is cool?

538
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,870
Hey, just listen to how cool he is.

539
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,740
His condition for joining the show was to have you in charge.

540
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,760
Well...

541
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,190
No way.

542
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:25,270
I don't know what he's scheming, but I'm too afraid to work with him.

543
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,060
Let's just say he is scheming something. Why does that matter?

544
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,750
Oh Young Shim, what are your priorities as a PD?

545
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,530
This is your last chance!

546
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,960
Look at your colleagues.

547
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,590
Each one makes a hit, moves to a new position, and makes another jackpot there!

548
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,810
Don't you feel anything?

549
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,550
Young Shim...

550
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,640
To get what you really want, you need to give up your pride a little...

551
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,820
and learn to kill your temper.

552
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,950
So... go and convince Kingvely to come back.

553
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,050
How can I work with Wang Kyeong Tae?

554
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,870
 I'm going to make this one a real hit.

555
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,350
 I'll do my best, make sure to get recognized for my work...

556
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:27,600
 and help you confidently draw successful Young Shim again, Dad.

557
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,700
 All right. Thank you.

558
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,730
Fine, then! I'll join him.

559
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,800
What do I need to do first?

560
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
Yes, that's the spirit.

561
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,470
One second.

562
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,130
Hey.

563
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,410
What?

564
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,950
Hey, Oh Young Shim...

565
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,360
Yes.

566
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,020
You're in big trouble.

567
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,590

568
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,060

569
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,340

570
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,450

571
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:23,090
 You're... the Wang Kyeong Tae I know, right?

572
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,890
 Wol Sook, let me ask you for a favor.

573
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,740
 A favor?

574
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,940
 Until the final date, please pretend not to know me.

575
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,350
 All right.

576
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,380
 Instead, there's a condition.

577
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,970
 What is it?

578
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,070
 During the final selections, pick me.

579
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,080
What the heck is this?

580
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,430
You know anything about this?

581
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,870
I don't know, either.

582
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:59,310
So this means... they colluded with each other, right?

583
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,600
Why are you asking me that?

584
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,330
Gosh, who the heck posted this online?

585
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:15,450
The news articles are up and our website's bulletin board is filling up with complaints.

586
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,380
I'll...

587
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,850
I'll go and look into this.

588
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,410
My handsome face without a single speck of flaw...

589
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,580
Oh Young Shim!

590
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,590
No, no.

591
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,860
Stop it. Relax.

592
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,920
Calm down.

593
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,150
How did she come out like that then and there?

594
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,260
Oh Young Shim really is unpredictable.

595
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,960
I shouldn't have gone there in the first place!

596
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,390
Come in.

597
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,900
CEO Wang, we're in deep trouble.

598
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,000
What is the fuss? What's the matter?

599
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,830
Did our new product get a crazy number of pre-orders?

600
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,950
That's not it.

601
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,220
Please listen to this.

602
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,870

What's this?

603
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,550
It was uploaded anonymously just now

604
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,910
and it's spreading like wildfire on SNS and YouTube.

605
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,980
There are news articles about it, too.

606
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,380
Something's not right about this, right?

607
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,100
Wait...

608
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,020
Who on Earth posted this?

609
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,850
Should we prepare counter-news articles?

610
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,240
No...

611
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,310
Let's just watch the situation for now.

612
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,510
We can do that, CEO Wang, but...

613
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,240
the direct attack on Kingvely is too much.

614
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,550
 I enjoyed the show, but they cheated us?

615
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,390
 Do they still make shows this way?

616
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,400
 Wang Kyeong Tae is the biggest loser of all time.

617
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,690
 I'm dropping Kingvely.

618
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,650
 What a liar. He's the worst.

619
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,860
 I'm done with him as of today.

620
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,170
The aftereffect is greater than expected.

621
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,120
The preference toward Kingvely and the number of new users rose after the broadcast...

622
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,640
are plummeting right after the controversy.

623
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,700
Even the existing users deleted their accounts? Does this make sense?

624
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,470
Including overall sales...

625
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:28,920
especially our company's PB products' sale rates... recorded its historical lowest today.

626
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,660
This quarter will be difficult because we've got a lot of order cancellations and refund requests.

627
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,110
We have a start-up investment company audit and an IPO coming up...

628
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,930
This is tough...

629
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,120
Wait...

630
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,530
Are you sure there's no other reason?

631
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,120
No.

632
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,450
The data doesn't lie.

633
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,650
That's what you said, CEO Wang.

634
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,490
It's because Kingvely's image is still directly related to that of its CEO.

635
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:05,630
It could be a betrayal of Kingvely's reputation of honesty and smartness you boasted.

636
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,150
With the rise of hostility,

637
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,730
I'm wondering if you shouldn't have gone on the show.

638
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Okay!

639
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,450
What's okay, CEO Wang? Is there a way?

640
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,840
We must pull a head-on breakthrough.

641
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,340
I'll go and resolve the controversy I created.

642
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,440

643
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,050
A head-on breakthrough...

644
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,660
Wol Sook, what do we do about the controversy?

645
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,750
Did you see the hate comments?

646
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,060
Of course, I did.

647
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,780
What if your reputation becomes tarnished?

648
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,430
Do you want to at least release clarification?

649
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,920
There's no need to clarify anything. You should enjoy this, too.

650
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,550
What?

651
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,690
Hate comments over no comments.

652
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,800
Hate comments equal attention.

653
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,420
Look. My number of subscribers doubled in just one day.

654
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,880
Dating and love are all business in the end.

655
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,970
PD Oh Young Shim?

656
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,890
How incredible of you.

657
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:48,810
Is this the sincere program you spoke of?

658
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,220
I'll find the leaker, no matter what.

659
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,880
No, no.

660
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,030
That's no longer important.

661
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,400
Why?

662
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,350
Since people only focus on the controversy itself.

663
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,650
I'll do whatever I can.

664
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,020
Whoa, back to position, back to position.

665
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,850
No. Don't do anything from now on.

666
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:18,150
The only thing for you to do now is to write a letter of apology.

667
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,830
- Chief Heo— 
 - Oh, oh!

668
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,000
There's one more thing.

669
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,220
They're shooting a documentary on deserted islands, so go join that team.

670
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,420
Islands?

671
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,760
I'll be trapped there for six months, then.

672
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,200
Gosh, Senior, are you really trying to exile me?

673
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,910
Islands, how nice are they?

674
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,300
You need to take a break.

675
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,040
Wait! I really think there's a misunderstanding this time.

676
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,300
I'll really take care of this one, just for once.

677
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,030
Good god, let's stop this, Young Shim.

678
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,420
Please help me out. I'll really resolve this. Give me one last chance, please?

679
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,060
There's nothing I can do anymore, either.

680
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,110
Gosh, I just need to find it.

681
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,950
Right? Please—

682
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,980
Well...

683
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh, well, CEO Wang, what brings you here?

684
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,640
I'll join the new variety show.

685
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,710
Gosh, seriously.

686
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,870
How unfortunate. I think the situation changed a lot.

687
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm disappointed, CEO Wang.

688
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,180
We need to resolve the issue right now, not start a new show.

689
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,300
We can do both.

690
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,130
Resolving the issue and starting a new show.

691
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,000
How so?

692
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,790
We need to break through head-on.

693
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:52,570
Also, Kingvely will sponsor the entire production cost for the new show.

694
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,670
 The entire production cost?

695
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,920
Not a bad deal for you, right?

696
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,110
I mean, well...

697
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:08,100
Even if production cost is taken care of...

698
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,330
How are you going to break through the controversy?

699
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:20,320
I'll apologize honestly for causing a problem with my feelings in the past

700
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,690
and create a genuine and sincere dating show with PD Oh Young Shim.

701
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:34,010

702
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,590
You and I?

703
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:42,910
We're going to get along... right?

704
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:53,090
♫  When you're asleep, I stay up all night, every night  ♫

705
00:43:53,090 --> 00:44:00,820
♫  Even if I close my heart's eyes that think of you, I still see you  ♫

706
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,170

707
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,810
 Hey, how are you going to do this?

708
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,060
 Bring me an idea in three days.

709
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,480
 Wh-Who do you think you are? You think you're the chief or something?

710
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,200
 I'm your lifeline, the key to PD Oh's survival in the variety show department.

711
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,170
 Am I not?

712
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,580
 Must we work with that guy Wang eoTae?

713
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,360
 Kyeong Tae coming back after 20 years, is it really a coincidence?

714
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:27,200
 How purely honest do you think a person can be?

715
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,400
 Shall we test it out right now?

716
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,830
 How honest one can become?

717
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:37,310
 In my opinion... we're wishing for the same thing.

718
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,960
 Shall we...

719
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,680
 Watch out!

720
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,350
 Wh-What's going on?

721
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,250
 I can't let her go like this!

722
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,620
♫  Without hesitating  ♫
