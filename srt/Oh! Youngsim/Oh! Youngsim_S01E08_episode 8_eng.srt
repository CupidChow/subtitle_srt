1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,770

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,590

3
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,370

4
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,860

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,600

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,850

7
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,050

8
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,690
PD Oh, please edit what happened today.

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,100
I was actually thinking about what to do—

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,330
Don't think about it and just erase it.

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,570
This is more miserable than being slapped on the street...

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,490
after confessing your feelings. You saw it, too.

13
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,360
Ki Ho...

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,060
I completely understand how you feel.

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,220
My sincerity was shunned.

16
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,960
But...

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,140
But you're going to broadcast that?

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,610
Ki Ho, aside from... this being broadcasted,

19
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,700
this is Yeo Wool's sincerity.

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,110
All the moments that were recorded today

21
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,630
were your story, but it's Yeo Wool's story, too.

22
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,600
Because of what happened today,

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,550
I feel like I'll never be able to love again!

24
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,070
But... you want me to keep this video and keep it forever?

25
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,260
No! I can't do that.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
All right.

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,230
For now... Ki Ho, calm down for now.

28
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,850
- And— 
 - Erase it.

29
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,170
Ki Ho, did you forget?

30
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:20,100
We agreed not to give up until the end, no matter what happens.

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,380
If it were you, do you think you could do that?

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,210
Oh! Wait, Ki Ho, you can't!

33
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,570
What are you doing? Give it back!

34
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,390
- Now! You can't! 
 - PD Oh! PD Oh...

35
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,540
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,820
Just blame it on me. Okay?

37
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,330
- All right? 
 - I said, you can't!

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,440
Wait, wait, Ki Ho! You can't! You absolutely can't!

39
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,610
No, no! Ki Ho!

40
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,500
Wait! Ki Ho!

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,920
Ki Ho!

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,340
Ki Ho! Open the door. You absolutely mustn't!

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,290
Think about it more rationally.

44
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,550
Ki Ho, I'll edit it real nice. Okay?

45
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,180
As time passes, you'll forget everything and live your life.

46
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,240
I'll take care of it.

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,230
No... No!

48
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,800
No, Ki Ho! Wait, Ki Ho!

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,280
Wait, Ki Ho! Ki Ho! Ki Ho!

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,210
Ki Ho, wait!

51
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:21,290

52
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,640

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,790
Kyeong Tae, where are you going?

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,690
I think Young Shim does have my watch.

55
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,270
You can locate her, then. Right?

56
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,820
I think I can approximate her location.

57
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,970
I'll be back.

58
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,380
- Well... 
 - Let me come with you!

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,180
What are you doing?

60
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,120
I was going to look at the map and check her location in the passenger seat.

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,980
You just drive properly, CEO Wang.

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,800
Just hurry up and put your seat belt on.

63
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,480
What's your deal?

64
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
I mean...

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,690
I keep getting bad thoughts and...

66
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,760
if something bad really happened to Senior Young Shim, what do we do?

67
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,620
Is it time to be crying?

68
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,220
If you keep that up, I'll leave you behind!

69
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,370
No, no, no!

70
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,930
No, I must come with you.

71
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,300
I'll keep my mouth shut and stay still.

72
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,920
Just watch this and follow her location.

73
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,530
G-Go straight.

74
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,270
You have to bring Oh Young Shim back. Okay?

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,480
What should I do?

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,880
I'm going nuts here...

77
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,760
- Ki Ho— 
 - Whoa, bloody hell!

78
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,070
Wh-When did you get in the car?

79
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,160
Please stop this now.

80
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,590
Stop the car, and let's talk this out calmly, please.

81
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,300
Gosh, why are you doing this? Just let me be!

82
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,630
I'm begging of you! Please give the laptop back!

83
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,470
You just need to get off. I'm never giving this to you.

84
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,990
I'm never getting off, either!

85
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,510
I'm also not getting off until I get the laptop!

86
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,580
Gosh, wh-what's your problem, seriously?

87
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,500
Well, what do you think you're doing? Stop the car right now!

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,580
Stop shaking your leg! I can't focus at all.

89
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,300
Excuse me. Come on and go faster! Why are you so slow?

90
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,550
Hurry up and step on it. Just step on the gas!

91
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,110
- I'm stepping on it as much as I can. 
 - Liar.

92
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,300
Gosh, we got further away! What are you doing?

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,840
Hurry up and step on it!

94
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,940
Gosh, seriously.

95
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,240
You don't know the roads around here.

96
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,350
- Stop the car right now! 
 - Gosh, please stop!

97
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,380
 Give back the laptop!

98
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,200
- Stop the car! 
 - You're going to get hurt!

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,150
- Stop it already. 
 - Give it back!

100
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,460
Go around the corner there and hurry up.

101
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,540
Yes, that white car right there. That one!

102
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,630
Go past that car and hurry.

103
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,910
Be quiet, for goodness' sake! You can't even drive.

104
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,530
Hurry up and step on it!

105
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,970
Ki Ho! Ki Ho!

106
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,350
Ki Ho!

107
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,430
Ki Ho!

108
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,660
Wait a second! Wait! Wait!

109
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,370
You can't! Please don't!

110
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,270
Wait! Wait a second!

111
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,380
You can't do this. You can't!

112
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,710
Wait a second.

113
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,280
Let's talk this out calmly, for once.

114
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,480
Wait up!

115
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,190
I'm sorry, PD Oh.

116
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,640
However, this is the only way. Okay?

117
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,430
No, you can't! Wait a second!

118
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,560
Don't you know this file's worth?

119
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,650
I know!

120
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,360
This is a file about my shameful past.

121
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,020
All of my shameful past contained here...

122
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,650
- I'll throw them away. 
 - You can't!

123
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,020
Don't do it!

124
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,460
- You can't— 
 - Let go of me!

125
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,950
Oh Young Shim!

126
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,500
Gosh... wh-why...

127
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,880
Get yourself together.

128
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,000
Kyeong Tae...

129
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,020
This is why I told you to stop holding onto me.

130
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,180
- Please take Young Shim to the car. 
 - Yes.

131
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,730
Ki Ho, p-please put it down.

132
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,060
Don't come closer.

133
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,690
Do you think doing this will make your shameful past disappear?

134
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,540
Mind your own business!

135
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,650
I'm asking if you think you'll stop being a loser overnight right now.

136
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,670
Hand it over.

137
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,360
Okay?

138
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,980
PD Oh Young Shim spent days and nights in...

139
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,530
preparing to make that, even when it made her pass out.

140
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,180
Days, you say?

141
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,650
Seven years.

142
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,540
The seven years I had a crush on Yeo Wool...

143
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,540
were trampled on and trashed like meaningless garbage!

144
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,920
And you dare to tell me that?

145
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,760
Only seven years?

146
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,300
Stop being a wimp when it was only seven years!

147
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,650
What did you say?

148
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,670
There's a person who spent 20 years like that.

149
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,160
2-20 years?

150
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,310
Do you know why...

151
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Do you know why I decided to accept you, despite your lack of qualifications?

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,010
Because you were so much like me.

153
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,830
Wait, stop making stuff up just to convince me.

154
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,900
The despair from the one I like not liking me back, even at the end,

155
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,480
your pride that hit rock bottom,

156
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,690
only your stubbornness remains...

157
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,890
making you a loser...

158
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,050
I know better than anyone, Ki Ho.

159
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,110
I know better about how you're feeling.

160
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,450
If you throw that away, you'll really remain a loser forever.

161
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,340
Do you wish for that to happen?

162
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:51,450
Though I used some big words... we can't help but admit defeat.

163
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,310
Don't you agree?

164
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,650
Why do you call that a defeat?

165
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,560
Isn't liking someone fine as is?

166
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,260
Why are you calling it a defeat and a waste of time?

167
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,270
The other person's feelings...

168
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,940
They're not mine.

169
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:25,670
The other person is the one who... decides how they feel about me.

170
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,120
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

171
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,620
It doesn't mean my feelings for her...

172
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,960
have suddenly become totally meaningless.

173
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,470
Why are you crying out of nowhere?

174
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,310
You don't have the right to say such things, do you?

175
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,350
Kingvely is really a horrible person!

176
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,680
Do I need a right to cry... when I'm just crying from getting rejected?

177
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,310
You were rejected?

178
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,450
Yes! I was rejected!

179
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,550
By Senior Young Shim...

180
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,260
 Come on—

181
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,950
 Senior, I like you.

182
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,690
 H-Huh?

183
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:22,450
 My wish... is for you to like me back.

184
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,860
 Stop joking around—

185
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,280
 Hey, I'm sorry.

186
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,800
 Well...

187
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,900
 I slipped there.

188
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,460
 I-I'm going to get back first.

189
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,530
 Senior...

190
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,990
 Y-Yes?

191
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,340
 You heard my wish, right?

192
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,050
 Why's that your wish?

193
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,150
 You're going to grant it, right?

194
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,450
 Say a different wish... Chae Dong.

195
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,920
 I know how much you trust me... and how much you like me.

196
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,830
 However...

197
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,060
 say a different wish.

198
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,370
 Why?

199
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,050
 It's getting cold, right?

200
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,650
 Wrap things up and come down.

201
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,170
 I'll go down first.

202
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,460
That's how...

203
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,130
I was rejected at once, with no mercy!

204
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,230
But still... yours is better than mine.

205
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,630
How is it any better when I couldn't even go on a date?

206
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,100
It's better to be rejected alone quietly than on a nationally embarrassing date.

207
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,780
I don't even have anyone to blame.

208
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,060
Even when I was rejected...

209
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,080
I have to keep seeing her at work every day.

210
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,520
I can't see her, even if I want to.

211
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,220
At least you're still young, PD Lee.

212
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,600
Young, my foot...

213
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,050
That doesn't make me feel any better, Ki Ho!

214
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,810
I know full well what you mean!

215
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,230
Ki Ho...

216
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,240
I know full well what you mean!

217
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,290
It's all that man's fault!

218
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,160
That man's an evil man!

219
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,100
He's the one to blame for everything!

220
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,250
Come here. Don't cry. Let's stop crying now!

221
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,900
♫  Things I want to say  ♫

222
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,420
♫  Things I can't say  ♫

223
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:45,990
♫  Afraid we might become more distanced  ♫

224
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,100
Oh Young Shim...

225
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,790
She should've been more careful.

226
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:07,100
♫  Because I see you going away from me  ♫

227
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:19,950
♫  I can't bring myself to stop you, and I can't even look away  ♫

228
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:25,490
♫  Because I keep missing you  ♫

229
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,570
♫  Because you're like an unforgettable dream  ♫

230
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:44,390
♫  I want to remain by your side, even for a short moment  ♫

231
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,880
♫  Because I keep longing for you  ♫

232
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,740
♫  Because there's so much I couldn't tell you  ♫

233
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:06,440
♫  I miss you so many times, even in one day  ♫

234
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:15,780
♫  But I only stay still, unable to say a word  ♫

235
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,710
Where are we?

236
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,070
Huh?

237
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,650
The broadcast station.

238
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,430
What?

239
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,970
The broadcast station?

240
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,800
 Wait, Ki Ho! Wait, Ki Ho! Ki Ho!

241
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,260
 K-Ki Ho! Ki Ho, wait a second!

242
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,330
 - Stop the car! 
 - You're going to get hurt!

243
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,680
 Don't! Don't do it!

244
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,170
 - You can't—  
  - Let go of me!

245
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,110
 Oh Young Shim!

246
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,430
Gosh, what happened?

247
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,960
When did we come all the way here?

248
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,980
I swear I was with Ki Ho.

249
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,640
You remember that part?

250
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,110
Yes.

251
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,420
And then you came...

252
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,560
Gosh, I can't remember.

253
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,470
The laptop!

254
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,880
What about Ki Ho? Are Ki Ho and the laptop okay?

255
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,790
He didn't jump in the water with it, did he?

256
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,160
- Here. 
 - Whoa! The laptop! I'm so glad!

257
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,400
Gosh, Kyeong Tae! I'm so glad!

258
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,990
The laptop is safe!

259
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,960
What's gotten into you?

260
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,630
How did you get it back?

261
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,050
I'll tell you later. Aren't you late?

262
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,090
Huh? Oh, I'm late.

263
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,330
Oh, here... this is yours.

264
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,110
Hurry up and get going.

265
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,920
Okay.

266
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Be careful!

267
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,300
 Pair up with Yeo Wool.

268
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,360
 - Then, I'll— 
 - I'll pair up with...

269
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,890
Gosh, my back...

270
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,600
 Are you okay, Ki Ho?

271
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,390
Gosh, what the heck? When did I get this scratch here?

272
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,250

PD Oh, I'm sorry for what I did.

273
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,070

I decided to accept that even the shameful past is mine.

274
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,500

I'll leave the editing in your hands.

275
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,120
Ki Ho, thank you.

276
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,740
I'll do a great job on the editing.

277
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,570
Wait a minute...

278
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,030
I also want to do something for Ki Ho.

279
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,560
I can't let our first applicant go like this.

280
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,250
Since we still have some time until the next applicant...

281
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,590
Let me look...

282
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,640

283
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,470
 I only worked all my life...

284
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,960
 and really, without any reason...

285
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,370
 I f-fell for her, really just for who she is.

286
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,300
 I really don't want to give up this time.

287
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,520
I really thought everything would end in success back then.

288
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,540
You didn't see this coming as well, right, Ki Ho?

289
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,490

I'm so jealous of the lady in Ki Ho's story.

290
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,590

You're my ideal man who is innocent and unchanging, Nam Ki Ho.

291
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,090

If you get rejected by any chance, please contact me.

292
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,400
"Please contact me?"

293
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,830
What the heck?

294
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,000
What am I going to do about this?

295
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,440

296
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,500
Ki Ho?

297
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,240
Oh, hello.

298
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,470
Whoa, you're looking great today.

299
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,100
If you can do this much alone, it's splendid.

300
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,080
Yes.

301
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,110
Well, they say you learn the most about life

302
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,760
during moments of struggle.

303
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,320
Show them that one-sided love isn't despair... but that it's an opportunity.

304
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,140
Okay?

305
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,890
Yes.

306
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:20,120
Oh, by the way, CEO Wang, how's your 20-year-old crush going?

307
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,800
Excuse me.

308
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,130
Yes, Soon Shim.

309
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,550
 CEO Wang, they say you have to come into the office and see something.

310
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,290
One second.

311
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,460
If you go inside first, I'll follow right after.

312
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,040
Okay.

313
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,930
Yeah.

314
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,310
Hello, I'm Yang Da Mi.

315
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,480
You look a lot more handsome in person.

316
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,880
Gosh, Da Mi, please.

317
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,870
Thank God, I was worried you wouldn't notice.

318
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,660
Oh, please. Go ahead.

319
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,930
Whoa, it's orange.

320
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,060
Do you like oranges?

321
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,190
Oh, yes.

322
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,430
I give this orange the peel of approval.

323
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,170
We've scored one with this one.

324
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,360
What a great mood.

325
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,390

Hello, PD Oh. This is Yoo Ho Jae.

326
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,490

You remember me, right?

327
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,180
 Yes, Ho Jae. How are you doing?

328
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,940

I was just wondering how you're doing.

329
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,710

330
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,750
 Wondering about me?

331
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,310
Hey, I'm going outside for a minute.

332
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,990
The mood is great and...

333
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,560
they even look great together as well.

334
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,500
Senior, are you going somewhere?

335
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,620
I'm going to the car to get a present for Ki Ho.

336
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,770
Oh, okay.

337
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,620
Senior, by the way, where did you park?

338
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,000
Why?

339
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,530
Let me carry it for you.

340
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,190
Oh, no. It's okay. I got it.

341
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,230
No, no.

342
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,380
I'll do it.

343
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,270
Senior...

344
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,970
I'm sure we can't be comfortable like before...

345
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,930
I'll continue to be a junior who likes you and looks up to you.

346
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,150
Sure.

347
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,660
Thank you, Chae Dong.

348
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,330
 I'm home.

349
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,120
Oh, you're home?

350
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,520
Ji Yoo, can you clean up your aunts' room for me today?

351
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,820
Me? Where did the aunts go?

352
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,430
You know they barely come home these days since they're so busy.

353
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,550
She's right. I think it'll be too much for your mom and me to do everything today.

354
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,570
Gosh, my back! My back. Gosh, why does it hurt?

355
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,650
You can clean their room and ask them for some allowance.

356
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,540
I'm counting on you.

357
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,880
Gosh, it's disgusting.

358
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,070
What is all this...

359
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,360
 The person you are calling is not answering the phone.

360
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,400
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

361
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,330
Yes, Lee Ji Yoo, what's up?

362
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,490
I'm busy, so keep it short.

363
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,700
I cleaned up your room. Give me some allowance.

364
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,340
Allowance?

365
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,150
You didn't need to clean it, though.

366
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,770
I already cleaned it, though.

367
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,790
You know how Oh Young Shim keeps it really messy in there. Right?

368
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,540
I only sneak in and sleep in there.

369
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,660
So ask for it from Aunt Young Shim.

370
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,750
Aunt Young Shim isn't even answering her phone.

371
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,920
Oh, that's right.

372
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,890
Oh Young Shim said she's broke this month because her bank account is empty.

373
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,120
Oh, this is what they call unpaid wages. Right?

374
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,650
I heard it gets solved when I go to the person's work and keep asking for the pay.

375
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,630
Just sell whatever Aunt Young Shim doesn't use and make some allowance money.

376
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,510
Oh Young Shim has a lot of things piled up that she's not using.

377
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,560
I'll take responsibility.

378
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,750
 I'm busy, so hang up now. Bye.

379
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,730
Come in.

380
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:21,410
These are last quarter's sales performance and last year's tax audit data.

381
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,990
Thanks.

382
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,320
Kyeong Tae...

383
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,840
Huh?

384
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,100
Nothing's wrong, right?

385
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,530
Don't worry about it.

386
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:56,170
Also, don't work overtime today... and get off work right away.

387
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,460
Yes.

388
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,040
You, too, Kyeong Tae.

389
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,920
Fighting.

390
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,030
 This is going to get ugly.

391
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,060
 You should look into this matter now.

392
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,180
 If you don't come back by the 19th,

393
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,660
 I have no choice but to turn the matter over to the Star Company's buyers.

394
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,790
 Call me and please come back.

395
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,780
 Min Kim.

396
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,170

397
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,470
She usually comes out around now.

398
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,720
Why isn't she coming out?

399
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,240
You scared me.

400
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,100
What are you doing?

401
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,020
I was exercising here for a moment.

402
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,600
Yeah.

403
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,310
E-Exercising.

404
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,700
Exercising? Here?

405
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,820
Yeah. I usually exercise before driving.

406
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,890
Like this and this.

407
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,220
You know, like this.

408
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,940
I see.

409
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,960
I think we're going in the same direction.

410
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,710
Get in if you want.

411
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,600
Sure.

412
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,080
Get in.

413
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,340

414
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,360
The next applicant, please come in.

415
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,540
Hello.

416
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,960
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

417
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,830
Please introduce yourself.

418
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,720
I'm Kim Min Ji, an 11th-grade student from Manna High School.

419
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,590
Could you tell us about the story you submitted?

420
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:23,350
 There's a boy named Woo Chan who went to the same elementary, middle, and high school as me.

421
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,260
We live in the same neighborhood and he follows me around everywhere.

422
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,400
I mean, he used to follow me around.

423
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,220
 Min Ji.

424
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,780
 Let's go to school.

425
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,610
 I told you not to bother me.

426
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,260
 Min Ji, wait for me!

427
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,940
 We ended really late today.

428
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,630
 Gosh, seriously. We used to end so early when we were younger.

429
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,570
 Why are they doing this?

430
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,650
 Min Ji.

431
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,600
 Do you want to go eat tteokbokki with me?

432
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,560
 Why would I eat tteokbokki with you?

433
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,710
 There's a new tteokbokki place in front of the school.

434
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,350
 It's half off until today.

435
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,550
 Really?

436
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,750
 Oh, but there must be a lot of people then.

437
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,980
 I hate waiting in line.

438
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,500
 Should I wait in line for you?

439
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,070
 Oh, come inside.

440
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,680
 Min Ji! Over here.

441
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,740
 Oh, you're next?

442
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,990
 How many people?

443
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,760
 Five people.

444
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,740
 Five people? Geez...

445
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,950
 Our tables are small, so more than four people will be hard.

446
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,840
 What should I do?

447
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,570
 I-I... can eat later.

448
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,520
 Let's go inside.

449
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,860
 Hey, why don't you just date him? He follows you everywhere.

450
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,770
 Are you crazy? Why would I date him?

451
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,130
 Why not? He only has eyes for you.

452
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,160
 Date him.

453
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,640
 This is so good.

454
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,180
 Do you have a wish?

455
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,670
 Tell me your wish.

456
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,240
 Really?

457
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,830
 Yeah.

458
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,780
 Next week is actually my birthday.

459
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,190
 D-Do you want to go to an amusement park?

460
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,270
 Sure, if I have the time.

461
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,980
But I couldn't reach him for days, so I even went to his house...

462
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,000
But he apparently went to study abroad for the winter break.

463
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,320
Study abroad?

464
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,690
And then I saw him after one year...

465
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,510
 Hey, look at him.

466
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,410
 - He's handsome! 
 - Amazing, that's crazy.

467
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,660
 Hey, Kang Woo Chan! Hurry up.

468
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,980
 Kang Woo Chan?

469
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,800
 Min Ji, that's him. Right?

470
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,530
 The Kang Woo Chan that followed you everywhere.

471
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,070
 Hey, Kang Woo Chan!

472
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,720
He has treated me like I was invisible since then.

473
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,250
He doesn't even acknowledge me.

474
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,390
 Kang Woo Chan, fighting!

475
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,750
 You went to the same middle school as Woo Chan. Right?

476
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,230
 Yeah.

477
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,560
 Can you give this to him for me?

478
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,590
 What is that?

479
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,040
Kim Min Ji applied to this?

480
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,540
Why?

481
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,670
You're probably flustered...

482
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,690
but Min Ji wants things to go well with you.

483
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,520
What a big dream.

484
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,860
They're young, but their story is relatable.

485
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,650
And they're innocent, too.

486
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,130
In the end, she doesn't want him,

487
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,270
but she also doesn't want to give him up?

488
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,990
Our young friend mustered up the courage to apply.

489
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:49,480
I think this is something that happens to everyone at that age at least once.

490
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,780
At least once?

491
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,040
That never happened to me.

492
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,770
I think we could proceed with a fresh and cute concept for this story.

493
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,750
Cute and fresh?

494
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,980
How about a double date?

495
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,380
 Double date?

496
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,420
If it's a double date, who here will be the other couple?

497
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,620
Of course, it should be...

498
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,300
Our program's concept is the Young Shim and Kyeong Tae from back in the day.

499
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,080
Well, must we fixate on that aspect?

500
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,570
If I go on a date, I can personally coach them and make it more fun for them.

501
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,930
Are you just going to sit there?

502
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,940
Say something.

503
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,010
Then Wol Sook and CEO Wang.

504
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,280
And Senior Young Shim and Chae Dong?

505
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,060
Oh, I don't want to.

506
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,140
I have some equipment to check first.

507
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,310
I'll get going.

508
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,640
Where are you going?

509
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,490
Then we'll just proceed as planned with CEO Wang and Senior Young Shim.

510
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,390
Is that all right?

511
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,270
You're busy, Kyeong Tae.

512
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,990
I heard you need to go public and expand your company.

513
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,360
Our Kyeong Tae says he's busy.

514
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,900
Let's leave the rest of the filming to someone else—

515
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,830
I'll do it.

516
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,100
It's work.

517
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,620
Really?

518
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,740
Whoa, is CEO Wang sincere about Love Mark now?

519
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,440
Chae Dong!

520
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,410
Chae Dong! Chae Dong! Hurry! Hurry!

521
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,340
Hurry!

522
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,760
Come on, Chae Dong. I laid out the game in your favor.

523
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,250
If you suddenly decline, what does that make me?

524
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,640
Did you forget about our alliance?

525
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,060
Oh, I...

526
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,930
I gave up... on Senior Young Shim.

527
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,070
G-Gave up? Why?

528
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,620
She said there was someone on her mind,

529
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,580
so she can't accept my feelings.

530
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,050
So you're just going to give up now?

531
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,210
She seemed sincere.

532
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,650
 Senior...

533
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,130
 Y-Yes.

534
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,520
 You heard my wish, right?

535
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,430
 Chae Dong...

536
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:43,390
 I know how much you trust me... and how much you like me.

537
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,240
 However...

538
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,570
 say a different wish.

539
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,970
Wait! If you were going to give up so easily, why did you like her for so long?

540
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,090
Don't you think it's unfair to you?

541
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,800
I'll help you out. Okay?

542
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,890
This is my way of loving Senior...

543
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,620
by respecting...

544
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,770
her opinion like this!

545
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,020
Don't cry. Come on!

546
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,340
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

547
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,880
"Despite everything, a new love has found its way to Ki Ho."

548
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,880
Nice transition.

549
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,210
I think it'll look better to photoshop them standing at the wishing rock.

550
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,100
Where did I put it? There it is.

551
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,610
Huh?

552
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,810
What the heck is this?

553
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,400
When did we film this?

554
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,340
 This is the wishing rock, huh?

555
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,880
 Making your wishes come true...

556
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,580
 My wish is for Oh Young Shim to...

557
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,540
 Why were we like that?

558
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:46,220
 As if there was some magic keeping us from telling the truth...

559
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,700
 we couldn't be honest with each other...

560
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,800
 until that incident happened.

561
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,860
♫  If I can be with you every step of the way  ♫

562
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,990
♫  I'll fly away like the drifting petals  ♫

563
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:13,960
♫  I'm calling for you and your name only  ♫

564
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:21,090
♫  I've got so many things I want to say  ♫

565
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:29,870
♫  I look back at the sight of you looking at me  ♫

566
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:38,470
♫  The entire world is becoming dyed white  ♫

567
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,260
♫  Will you always be by my side like this moment?  ♫

568
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,540

569
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,900
 Did I say I want tteokbokki?

570
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,370
 Why are you being such a petty man?

571
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,110
 I quit.

572
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,850
 She said she's going to apologize!

573
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,670
 I heard you almost had a flat noodle kiss with Kyeong Tae, huh?

574
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,920
 Wasn't he just messing with me?

575
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,230
 You're really something else, too.

576
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,080
 Sleeping like a log even in this situation.

577
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,720
 Min Ji!

578
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,530
 Why are you looking for a brat who ran out on her own two feet?

579
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,090
 Why did you become so twisted?

580
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,130
 Just forget it.

581
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,470
 I won't ask for your help anymore, either.

582
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,840
 I think I can feel what you're feeling.

583
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,880
 You were like me once, right, Hyung?

584
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,200
 Me?

585
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,260
 Didn't you ever read the comics?

586
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,430

587
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,410
 Does that mean Kyeong Tae is finally leaving this house?

588
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,040
 I'm happy for you.

589
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,110
 Are they already done with the constructions?

590
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,350
 With this style, you can say your blind date is already halfway to success.

591
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,770
 Oh Young Shim really threw that out?

592
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,200
 But why didn't she tell me?

593
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:52,010
