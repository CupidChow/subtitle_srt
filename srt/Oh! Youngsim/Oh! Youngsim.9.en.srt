(Song Ha Yoon as the Young Sim we all know)

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,219
(Lee Dong Hae as the nerd Wang Kyung Tae)

(Lee Min Jae as Young Sim's junior, Lee Chae Dong)

(Jung Woo Yeon as Gu Wol Sook)

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,140
(Ga Young as Soon Sim, and Song Young Jae as Dae Kwang)

(Cho Yu Ha as Ji Yu, Tony An as Lee Woo Sang,)

7
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,979

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,920
(Oh! YoungSim)

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,019
(Ki Ho found a new love.)

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,560
(Life is so unpredictable, isn't it?)

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,429
That sounds smooth.

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,328
It would be nice if we could Photoshop...

13
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,329
a picture of them together in front of the wishing rock.

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,469
Let's see...

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,870
What is this?

16
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,739
When did they take this?

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,750
So this is the wishing rock, is it?

18
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,230
A rock that grants wishes...

19
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,980
My wish is for Young Sim's...

20
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,930
(Episode 9: We Were Someone's Young Sim and Kyung Tae)

21
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,150
No. I need something that looks cooler.

22
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,680
Something cooler...

23
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,050
Blue?

24
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:31,419
A jacket.

25
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,860
It looks good with a tie.

26
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,770
Good. It's perfect.

27
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,240
Perfect.

28
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,569
Shall I get going?

29
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,979
(YoungSim Tteokbokki)

30
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,849
I didn't know the tteokbokki place Min Ji talked about...

31
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,550
was my brother-in-law's restaurant.

32
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,590
Hey.

33
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,560
What if my restaurant goes viral after the show?

34
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:06,789
Well...

35
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,989
Anyway, what do you want today?

36
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,159
Wheat rice cakes or rice cakes? Or maybe noodles?

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,569
- Wheat rice cakes. - Wheat rice cakes.

38
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,199
Wheat rice cakes?

39
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,669
Do you want any toppings? What kind of noodles do you want?

40
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,199
- Glass noodles. - Glass noodles.

41
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,009
You two don't get along, but you have the same taste.

42
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,090
Here is your chewy tteokbokki.

43
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,229
Amazing.

44
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,259
This one is for you. Enjoy.

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,370
- Thank you. - It looks so good.

46
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,569
Enjoy it.

47
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,539
I never said I wanted tteokbokki.

48
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,438
Do you not like it?

49
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,309
Should we go eat something else?

50
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,580
What do you like?

51
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,340
I'm not craving anything.

52
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,110
I just want to go home.

53
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,419
What are you doing?

54
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,289
What? What did I do?

55
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,590
You just stepped on me.

56
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,120
I did? I didn't feel anything.

57
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,399
I have long legs, so it can't be helped.

58
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,730
It looks delicious.

59
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,740
I'd rather eat than stare.

60
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:25,639
- Let's hurry up and eat. - Okay.

61
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,040
Apologize to me.

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,910
It was an accident.

63
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,240
Then can I step on you too?

64
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,309
Of course not. No way.

65
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,948
These shoes are expensive. You can't get them anywhere.

66
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,519
You can't afford them.

67
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,589
Then apologize sincerely to me.

68
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,990
Why is a man acting so stingy?

69
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
I don't want to do this anymore.

70
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,329
I'm offended.

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,959
- Where are you going? - No, wait!

72
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,560
Wait.

73
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,199
He's a really nasty guy, that's why.

74
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,169
He's going to apologize.

75
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,470
Watch. He's about to apologize.

76
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,009
Apologize to him.

77
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,040
- Sorry. - See? He apologized.

78
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,278
- Happy? - Please, let it go.

79
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,680
He apologized right away.

80
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,579
Woo Chan, I'll buy you lots of food.

81
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,629
Min Ji wanted to have tteokbokki with you.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,259
She was sorry she couldn't eat with you last time.

83
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,629
Also, Min Ji is treating today.

84
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,339
Yes. So please enjoy it.

85
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,439
Do you want some fritters? I know you like it.

86
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,139
Forget it. I won't eat something so childish.

87
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,350
Open up.

88
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:49,819
What's with you?

89
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,290
Did you skip lunch again?

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,589
- What? - You don't even have to tell me.

91
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,160
Here. Open up.

92
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,459
This was never discussed.

93
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,229
We should act sweet and natural.

94
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,069
It'll make things less awkward for them.

95
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,970
It doesn't look natural at all.

96
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,610
Isn't that what you want?

97
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,279
For them to get closer again?

98
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,209
What are you two doing?

99
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,009
Us?

100
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,518
We used to go out to eat tteokbokki together...

101
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,849
when we were young too. It brought back memories,

102
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,819
so we talked in secret for a moment. Right?

103
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
I see.

104
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,829
Yes.

105
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,060
We're trying our best. Aren't you guys going to try?

106
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,259
He's right.

107
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,600
We're going to eat.

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,839
We'll eat.

109
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,480
My arm hurts.

110
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,910
We don't want his arm to hurt.

111
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,379
It's so delicious.

112
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,449
Let's talk while we eat.

113
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,889
You should eat too.

114
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,089
Wait, did the glass noodle get in their dish?

115
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,519
What? Did you put that in on purpose?

116
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:34,689
It should be in Min Ji and Woo Chan's dish.

117
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,160
What?

118
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,269
What are you doing?

119
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,438
This is an expensive shirt.

120
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,810
Why did he have to spit his food on me?

121
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,310
Hey.

122
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,419
Do you know how much this shirt costs?

123
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,259
Why would you wear something so expensive to a snack bar?

124
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,429
Are you trying to impress someone?

125
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,100
That punk...

126
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,470
He has keen eyes.

127
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,710
(To YoungSim Tteokbokki)

128
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,309
Yes, Min Ji.

129
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
What's with that guy named Wang Kyung Tae?

130
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,590
He's not helpful at all.

131
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,320
What if he makes Woo Chan hate me?

132
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,990
Is he going to take responsibility for it?

133
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,299
He's not a bad guy...

134
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:18,899
He's terrible.

135
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,100
Can we do it without him next time?

136
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,769
I'll try harder for the next date.

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,669
Don't worry about today and sleep tight.

138
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,379
Okay, I got it.

139
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,779
Bye.

140
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,919
Wang Kyung Tae...

141
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,889
He's really not helpful at all.

142
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,059
- Young Sim. - Yes?

143
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,399
I heard you almost kissed Kyung Tae while eating.

144
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,329
What? What kiss? No.

145
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,499
Things happen with shoots.

146
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,179
He gave me such a hard time today, you know.

147
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,779
What's with her? I'm only joking.

148
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,309
Hello? It's me.

149
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,250
Yes. What's the current situation?

150
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,179
And?

151
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,559
What's with him today?

152
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,830
Wait.

153
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,500
Was he pranking me like he did on "The Arrows of Love?"

154
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,820
This is the place you guys come to after exams, right?

155
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,350
Woo Chan, you can sit over there.

156
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,519
Let's try to get closer today.

157
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,759
Okay.

158
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,730
- Should we join them? - Where are you going?

159
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,470
Here's your favourite comic book. It's the newest release.

160
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,139
I don't like that comic book anymore.

161
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,750
("YoungSim")

162
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,690
"YoungSim?"

163
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,269
They haven't said a thing for 30 minutes.

164
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,210
Gosh, what a waste of time.

165
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,710
Hey, I'm heading out first.

166
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,279
Mr. Wang.

167
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,490
Is Young Sim beside you?

168
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,220
Get up.

169
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,529
Hey. Get up.

170
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,519
All those years ago,

171
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,220
why...

172
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,330
did you disappear without saying goodbye?

173
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,669
Young Sim, can you hear me?

174
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,500
Say something if you can.

175
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,519
You amaze me.

176
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,190
How can you sleep so deeply in a situation like this?

177
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,590
It's a talent.

178
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,679
You have such a funny face.

179
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,059
Have some of this.

180
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,139
Hey, Kang Woo Chan.

181
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,139
You're really pushing it.

182
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,350
Why are you ignoring me?

183
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,090
Why do you act like you can't see me when I'm right here?

184
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,490
What's wrong with it?

185
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,529
That was what you used to do to me.

186
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,330
How does it feel to get ignored?

187
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,169
Pretty nasty, right?

188
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,169
Woo Chan.

189
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,870
- That was why I apologized. - You ignored me at your will.

190
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,279
Now you're apologizing at your will too.

191
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,080
It's too bad. I don't want to accept your apology.

192
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,220
Also,

193
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,059
do you think I would like you for doing something like this?

194
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,230
Then why did you agree to do this?

195
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,929
To torment you forever.

196
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,399
Whenever you watch this,

197
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,309
you'll be forced to remember...

198
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,570
how selfish and nasty you are.

199
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,320
Young Sim!

200
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,019
It's no time to take a nap.

201
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,758
Min Ji left during the shoot. It's a mess!

202
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,830
Hurry up.

203
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
What?

204
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,070
Get out.

205
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,070
Min Ji!

206
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,710
Kim Min Ji!

207
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,889
Where did she go?

208
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,159
Where is she?

209
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,970
Did you not find her?

210
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:36,869
- No. - I'll check that side.

211
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,299
That's enough.

212
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,639
What?

213
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,809
She left on her own will. Why are you looking for her?

214
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,840
How can you say that?

215
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:46,740
She ran out because Woo Chan's words hurt her.

216
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,080
What he said was true.

217
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,719
She wants to have him under her thumb,

218
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,678
but since it's not going her way, she runs away.

219
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,820
Why bother looking for her?

220
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,250
Why are you so bitter?

221
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,259
I'm only stating the facts.

222
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,059
Why did you agree to do this show?

223
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,899
You're so negative, and you don't see hope in them.

224
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,029
Why did you agree to it?

225
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,170
Also, you only care about your company's image.

226
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,940
Am I wrong?

227
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,079
Forget it. I won't ask for your help again.

228
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,009
Min Ji!

229
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,519
I'm glad you gave her a piece of your mind.

230
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,460
Well?

231
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,630
Do you feel better now?

232
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,210
There was something you two didn't tell us, right?

233
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,220
(Recycling)

234
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,369
The teddy bear you gave her was in the trash?

235
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,349
I had recorded my voice on it.

236
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,220
Hi, Min Ji. I want us to celebrate my birthday together.

237
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,559
Let's meet at Haetbit Park at 6pm.

238
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,009
I think I know the feeling.

239
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,480
It's happened to you too, right?

240
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,250
Me?

241
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,549
("14-Year-Old YoungSim")

242
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,259
You read this?

243
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,890
The Kyung Tae in this story is you.

244
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,259
And Ms. Oh is Young Sim.

245
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,500
It's all in the past.

246
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,599
I'm not trying to comfort you.

247
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,599
But Young Sim was far worse than Min Ji.

248
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,899
Young Sim humiliated me in various different ways.

249
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,539
I delivered her bread and did woodwork for her.

250
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,940
Just the thought of is just...

251
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,579
The way I see it,

252
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,079
Min Ji is quite tame.

253
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,519
I disagree.

254
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,849
Ms. Young Sim is very different...

255
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,420
from her.

256
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,660
What's so different?

257
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,529
Haven't you read this?

258
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:58,000
("14-Year-Old YoungSim" Book 5)

259
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,680
Min Ji!

260
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,049
Min Ji.

261
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,990
Are you okay?

262
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,000
I know it's hard.

263
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,440
If you don't want this anymore,

264
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,869
we can stop now.

265
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:39,779
I don't want to push forward...

266
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,809
and risk seeing you get hurt.

267
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,319
I'm not going to quit.

268
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,690
What?

269
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,960
Woo Chan has changed so much,

270
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,930
and I think it's all my fault.

271
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,130
So...

272
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,970
I'm going to turn him back into the old Kang Woo Chan.

273
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,210
And I'm going to make him like me again.

274
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,710
I won't give up.

275
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:14,880
All right.

276
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,079
If we've all had enough of a break,

277
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,619
why don't we start shooting again?

278
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,490
Let's stop reading comic books and make conversation this time.

279
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,400
All right. Then dinner and snacks are on Kingvely!

280
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,799
Special delivery.

281
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,200
What is this?

282
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,069
It's addressed to your name.

283
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,170
My name?

284
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,009
Surprise.

285
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,210
- Young Sim. - Yes.

286
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:49,809
What do you think happiness is?

287
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:51,619
Happiness?

288
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,589
Director Lee! She's about to vomit!

289
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,059
Hello Ms. Oh. It's Yoo Ho Jae.

290
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,319
Do you remember me?

291
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,890
I thought of you, so I got in touch.

292
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,960
Ho Jae?

293
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,529
What?

294
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,470
I heard you were filming a new show, so I came to show my support.

295
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,180
- I see. - A surprise, out of the blue?

296
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,480
Are they dating?

297
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,919
My goodness, Young Sim.

298
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,160
Maybe this is the start of a real relationship for you.

299
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,259
A real love has blossomed for "Love Mark."

300
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,970
Why didn't you tell us you were involved with that writer?

301
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,569
We're not involved. He came to support the show.

302
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,639
Come one. What kind of man...

303
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,368
would bring a basket of snacks and flowers...

304
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,680
to come and see you?

305
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,410
What is this?

306
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,380
"My Heart is Oh, So Bored."

307
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,650
That's the title of his new poetry book, right?

308
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,720
Gosh. It's so cringy!

309
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:08,390
Why?

310
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,298
Look at that title. It's aimed at you.

311
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,799
He must be completely obsessed with Young Sim.

312
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,569
Wait. Kyung Tae.

313
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,039
The work on your house is done and the renovations are complete.

314
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,048
Oh, my. Does that mean Kyung Tae can finally move out of this house?

315
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,349
That's great.

316
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,549
They've already finished all the work?

317
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,049
Yes.

318
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,190
Should I prepare for your move?

319
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,319
No, it's fine. I'll handle it.

320
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,259
- All right. - Have fun.

321
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,098
- Hey, Young Sim. - Yes?

322
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:48,700
You're seeing Ho Jae tomorrow, right?

323
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,598
Gu Wol Sook is the master of blind dates.

324
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,038
I'll take care of everything from head to toe.

325
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,240
You have my full support.

326
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,009
Don't you think going on a date is going too far?

327
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,650
It's just one date. Who cares?

328
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,279
We're not suggesting it's serious or you should get married.

329
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,618
We need to try on clothes to see if they suit us,

330
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,819
so of course, we should get to know people too.

331
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Wol Sook is right about that.

332
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,858
You could get to know him and realize he's actually great.

333
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,358
Exactly. The view of the Han River from there is amazing too.

334
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,029
It's the most popular Michelin-star restaurant.

335
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,670
Eat delicious food, get to know a man,

336
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:25,000
take in the view, and have a relaxing time.

337
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,970
You'd be a fool not to go.

338
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,240
In that case,

339
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,740
should I go tomorrow?

340
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,950
Of course, you should.

341
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,359
Okay.

342
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,670
You'll virtually win over your date with this styling alone.

343
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:07,579
Ho Jae?

344
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,750
Young Sim.

345
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,750
I didn't recognize you.

346
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,849
- Please, sit. - Thank you.

347
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,710
It's the weekend. Why is the house so quiet?

348
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,380
Everyone must be busy except you and me.

349
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,329
They're noisy when they're here, but I'm lonely without them.

350
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,000
Goodness.

351
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,838
Mr. Oh. I'd appreciate it if you made me handsome from now on.

352
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,940
"I'd appreciate it if you made me handsome..."

353
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,220
My goodness.

354
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,849
My new son-in-law, Kyung Tae!

355
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,220
Gosh. Look at this.

356
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Darn it.

357
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,009
These glasses will look great on Wang Kyung Tae.

358
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,710
Can I borrow your headphones for a few days?

359
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,578
Someone gave them as a present to me.

360
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,848
I'll use them nicely and return them.

361
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:29,849
You trust me, right?

362
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,720
Then you must return them before Christmas Eve. Okay?

363
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,089
You have to give them back to me then!

364
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,039
What is this?

365
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,609
What's taking Wang Kyung Tae so long?

366
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
How dare he make me wait?

367
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,890
He better not show up,

368
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,059
or I'll break him to pieces.

369
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:19,670
Young Sim really waited for me?

370
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,670
You must know...

371
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,910
that keeping promises also show one's feelings.

372
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,950
Breaking a promise without a word...

373
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,279
means you don't cherish the feelings of the other person.

374
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,450
It's the same thing, isn't it?

375
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,089
How come she didn't tell me?

376
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,789
(Ji Yu's room)

377
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,279
Unless she threw that out, it must be around here.

378
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,369
Right. It's all probably made up.

379
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,009
You startled me.

380
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,009
What are you doing there?

381
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,250
What are you doing in my aunt's room like a thief?

382
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,150
What? A thief?

383
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,879
How could you call me a thief? I'm not what you think.

384
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,920
Let me pass through.

385
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,019
I'm thinking about telling my family what I saw just now.

386
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,459
Who taught you to talk like that? Get out of my way.

387
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,029
Who do you think?

388
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,529
That was some long excuse.

389
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,039
Wait. Who are you going to call?

390
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,410
Well, if you were to tell me the truth,

391
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,579
I might let this slide.

392
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,150
Well,

393
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,950
I was looking for a teddy bear.

394
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,490
A teddy bear?

395
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,619
There's a story behind that teddy bear.

396
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,460
You're not just making stuff up because you're flustered, right?

397
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,068
I shouldn't have said anything. Forget it. I'll go.

398
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:05,069
Wait.

399
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,309
Is that what you're talking about?

400
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:15,279
Are you talking about the teddy bear with glasses?

401
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,980
Have you seen it?

402
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,449
Just sell something she doesn't use...

403
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,519
and use it as your allowance.

404
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,690
I see.

405
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,700
Yes.

406
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,500
You saw the teddy bear?

407
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,278
Someone wanted to buy a vintage teddy bear.

408
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
So I just sold it to someone through an app.

409
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,549
She said she lived near Haetbit Park.

410
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,018
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

411
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,519
Come on. Why isn't she answering her phone?

412
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,630
What is this?

413
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:08,029
Hey, you!

414
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,170
Wait.

415
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,670
You're holding your phone. Why aren't you answering that?

416
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,509
No way. You came all the way here?

417
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,710
I said no. I'm not going to sell it.

418
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,910
Hey.

419
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,150
Sell it back to me.

420
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,650
I'll double... No. I'll give back triple what you paid for.

421
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,259
What's your problem?

422
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,289
I really need that.

423
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,430
Why does it have to be this?

424
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,089
You can buy something more expensive.

425
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,059
I need that...

426
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,670
to untangle the 20 years of my life that's been royally messed up.

427
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:48,500
So sell it back to me. Please?

428
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,150
Yes. This is the date I've been picturing.

429
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,059
I won't mess it up no matter what.

430
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,819
After my date with you on that show,

431
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:11,589
for some reason, I kept thinking about you.

432
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,599
Whenever I thought of you,

433
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,970
I smiled before I knew it.

434
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,440
See? I just smiled too.

435
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,140
Really?

436
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,439
Thanks to you, I was able to publish the poetry book I had been stuck...

437
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
with for a year.

438
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:34,180
I think you might have been my muse.

439
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,758
Don't say anything.

440
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,289
But when he says something, smile as hard as you can.

441
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,460
Don't say anything special or blurt out nonsense.

442
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,130
Okay?

443
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,930
How's the food?

444
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,440
It's tasty.

445
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:04,779
I see. That's good.

446
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,450
How's the shoot with your new show going?

447
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,420
It's really fun.

448
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,389
I see. Okay.

449
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,039
My clothes accentuate your figure to make you look feminine.

450
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:33,179
On your date, just remember to push back your hair a few times.

451
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,280
Then show him your neckline.

452
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,460
Young Sim, are you unwell?

453
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Pardon?

454
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,428
I noticed that your breathing is getting rapid.

455
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,199
And you keep touching your neck.

456
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:02,409
I'm okay.

457
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:08,409
Thank you for visiting our restaurant.

458
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,750
Our wishing tree lights up every night.

459
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:15,149
If you want, you can ask our staff...

460
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,919
for a piece of paper to write down your wish.

461
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,090
Once you write down your wish,

462
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,218
we can help you hang it up on the wishing tree.

463
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,059
I hope you will make a wish on our tree.

464
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,559
A wish...

465
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:31,900
A rock that grants wishes...

466
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,849
My wish is for Young Sim's...

467
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
Young Sim.

468
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,219
Do you want to order desserts?

469
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,250
It's not him.

470
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,389
Ho Jae.

471
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,130
I don't think...

472
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,829
this is going to work out.

473
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,269
I'm sorry.

474
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,650
It's okay.

475
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,750
I'm not that slow, you know.

476
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,989
There must be someone you can't stop thinking about.

477
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,940
You should be with someone who makes you be yourself.

478
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,869
And I found...

479
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:55,280
the old you much cooler than the new you.

480
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,389
Thank you for everything.

481
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,989
Thank you.

482
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,559
I'll get going now.

483
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,940
What did you expect, Young Sim?

484
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,480
Oh Young Sim, who were you kidding with this date,

485
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,840
boyfriends, or love at that?

486
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,619
I ruined everything again.

487
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,980
Things were going so well.

488
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,519
Why did I think of Wang Kyung Tae on my date?

489
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:53,860
Hey, Wang Kyung Tae.

490
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,469
What are you doing here?

491
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,869
Did the date go well?

492
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,869
Yes. Of course.

493
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,710
I had a great time on my date.

494
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,078
(Oh Young Sim)

495
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,149
(Missed calls from Oh Young Sim)

496
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,690
Then why did you call me?

497
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,789
Well...

498
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,559
I...

499
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
To be honest, I don't know, either.

500
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,440
I ended up ruining my date.

501
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,510
I guess I have no game.

502
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:52,690
This is all...

503
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,460
your fault.

504
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,909
That's...

505
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,039
Why do you have that?

506
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,449
What are you doing?

507
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,280
Let go of me. I can't breathe.

508
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,199
Did something happen? What's wrong?

509
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,510
This is all your fault too.

510
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,840
I missed you.

511
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,719
What is this? When did they take this?

512
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,699
So this is the wishing rock, is it?

513
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,210
A rock that grants wishes...

514
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:05,989
My wish is for Young Sim's...

515
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,360
wish to come true.

516
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,059
That's all I need.

517
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:50,230
(Oh! YoungSim)

518
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,429
How about a date in school uniforms?

519
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:53,599
School uniforms?

520
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,138
We got the high school uniforms. Ta-Da.

521
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:57,269
- Ta-Da. - Ta-Da.

522
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,609
At this rate,

523
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,309
we might get an offer to be in a school uniform commercial.

524
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,750
I didn't know life could be so beautiful.

525
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:08,480
- Did you see this? - What's this?

526
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:11,049
Yes. I was drunk during my livestream...

527
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,860
and blurted that out. And that ended up in the articles.

528
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,219
Given what happened,

529
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,929
why don't we come up with a strategy?

530
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,099
Gosh. Is that really necessary?

531
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,559
This is where the CEO of Kingvely lives.

532
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,999
This is so nice.

533
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,269
What do you want from me?

534
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,070
Can't you tell...

535
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:28,739
what I want from you?

536
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,039
I really don't have much time left.

537
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,279
For my program, I can even sing and dance...

538
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,150
in the middle of the busy street at Gangnam Station.

539
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,809
Are you really leaving tomorrow?

540
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:40,849
Fine. Leave!

541
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:42,789
I'm free!

542
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,219
Are you really going to do this?

543
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,019
If you leave now,

544
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:51,460
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
