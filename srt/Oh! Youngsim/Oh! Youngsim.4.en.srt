(Song Ha Yoon as the Young Sim we all know)

(Lee Dong Hae as the nerd Wang Kyung Tae)

(Lee Min Jae as Young Sim's junior, Lee Chae Dong)

(Jung Woo Yeon as Gu Wol Sook)

(Ga Young as Soon Sim, and Song Young Jae as Dae Kwang)

(Cho Yu Ha as Ji Yu, Tony An as Lee Woo Sang,)

00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,979
(and Wang Ji Hye as Jin Sim)

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,920
(Oh! YoungSim)

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,219
I can do both.

10
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,320
The new variety show and damage control.

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,020
How?

12
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,189
We must face this head-on.

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,630
And Kingvely...

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,159
will cover all the production cost for the new show.

15
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,600
All the production cost?

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,900
Isn't that a good deal?

17
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,379
But how will you get through the scandal?

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,480
Due to my feelings from the past, I ended up causing trouble.

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,790
I will apologize sincerely.

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,290
Young Sim and I will make a reality dating show...

21
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,819
with honesty this time.

22
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,599
You and me?

23
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,310
You're on board with this. Right?

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,510
For us.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Young Sim.

26
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
Yes?

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,790
Did you two come up with this together?

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,819
Sure.

29
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,030
We will make it work.

30
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,790
We'll do it.

31
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,530
Then I want to see the proposal first.

32
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,500
- Okay. - Director.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,969
I'm the CEO of Kingvely.

34
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,909
I don't take people's word for it.

35
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,610
If you're confident, bring me a proposal to persuade me.

36
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,509
You.

37
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,889
This is the last chance I can give you, Young Sim.

38
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,389
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,789
I'll give you ten days.

40
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,289
I can't wait longer than that.

41
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,229
Ten days will be more than enough time.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,439
(Episode 4: Four Youths Under One Roof)

43
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,239
(Director Office)

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,340
Hey. I get that you're desperate.

45
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,310
But you know nothing about this industry. Ten days?

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,250
How are you going to pull this off?

47
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,978
It's fine as long as we make it work.

48
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,780
And we will make it work.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,889
- It's not as easy as it sounds. - Goodness.

50
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,819
No. Hold on. We can discuss that later.

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,659
Earlier, you said you'd cover all the production costs.

52
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,888
If you're doing that because you feel bad

53
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,229
- for me... - Let's make this clear.

54
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,598
I'm not doing this for you.

55
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,729
I'm doing it to restore Kingvely's image to the public.

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,599
Seriously. You shouldn't have rigged the result with Wol Sook.

57
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,810
Because of what you did, my life got so messy. Darn it.

58
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,909
No wonder why I wanted to throw you over the shoulders when I saw you.

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,009
- Gosh. You still got that temper. - Goodness.

60
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,279
Then you should've taken better care of the filming files.

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,189
You didn't keep them safe, so it leaked.

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,889
How can a professional producer let this happen?

63
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:38,819
That's why the director doesn't believe in you, either.

64
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,659
What? What did you just say?

65
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,590
What do you know about my life?

66
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,460
Am I wrong? That's the truth.

67
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,400
How could you blame this on me after all that's happened?

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,598
Hey, you're unbelievable.

69
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,668
Do your employees know what a jerk you are?

70
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:55,669
Do they know that you're just an immature loser?

71
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:56,978
"A loser?"

72
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,379
Yes. A loser.

73
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,080
It shouldn't be called Kingvely. It should be called Loserly.

74
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,309
- "Loserly?" - Yes, Loserly.

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,918
- Loserly? - Yes! Loserly.

76
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,718
- Are you done? - No!

77
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,090
You're a loser and a fraud!

78
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,029
Is it going well?

79
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,699
It's quite noisy out here.

80
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,129
Yes. We're in a heated debate.

81
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,028
- A debate? - That's right.

82
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,698
Producer Oh has so much passion. That should be her nickname.

83
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,269
Passionate Producer.

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,378
A great program will be created from a passionate debate.

85
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,319
Just trust us and wait.

86
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,079
It looks like Kingvely will be taking the lead.

87
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,589
Producer Oh.

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,220
I have no doubt that we'll work well together. Right?

89
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,560
Of course, we will. Mr. Wang.

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,060
Okay. I'll look forward to it.

91
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

92
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,540
All right.

93
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,279
Losing one's livelihood is indeed the biggest fear.

94
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,589
You're willing to team up with this loser and fraud.

95
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,490
The same goes for you too.

96
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,529
So are you in or out?

97
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,829
This is the last time Kingvely will make an offer.

98
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,569
Producer Oh.

99
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,370
Are you in?

100
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,980
I must save the last ounce of pride I have left as a producer.

101
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,050
That's why I'm doing it.

102
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,749
I'm going all-in to restore Kingvely's tarnished image.

103
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,188
All-in.

104
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,588
So don't bring your personal feelings into this.

105
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,259
Let's just focus on work. Okay?

106
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,660
I should be telling you that, Mark Wang.

107
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,800
Gosh. You and your grip...

108
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,800
- How many fingers? - Three.

109
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,939
- Can you see them? - Three.

110
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,910
I'll give you three days to come up with an idea.

111
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,369
What? Three days?

112
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,180
Who are you to boss me around? Are you the director?

113
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:17,009
Me? I'm the only hope you have in surviving...

114
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,420
as a producer. Don't you agree?

115
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,449
We're supposed to work on this together.

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm busy making money with my business. Bye.

117
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,160
Later.

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Wang Kyung Tae.

119
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,600
Wang Kyung Tae!

120
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,639
Wait. Three days?

121
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,040
That's not a lot of time. I must hurry.

122
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,040
- Young Sim, it's too dangerous! - Help!

123
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,508
- Young Sim! - Save Young Sim first!

124
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,479
- This is their childhood past? - Save Young Sim first!

125
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,589
Wait. He liked Young Sim this much?

126
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,719
- Young Sim, wake up. - Gosh.

127
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,629
- How much of this is fictional? - You can't die. I must save her.

128
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,698
Just like I learned in class,

129
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,160
breathe.

130
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,839
I didn't see this coming. He won't make this easy for me.

131
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,039
Young Sim, if you want someone from a startup,

132
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
what do you think about him?

133
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,779
It's called Kingvely. It's a unicorn startup on the rise.

134
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,279
They made tons of money by selling clothes online.

135
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,819
The CEO is in Seoul now.

136
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Why did I suggest Kingvely?

137
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:40,769
I shot myself in the foot.

138
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,190
This is killing me.

139
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,759
No. This can't be the end of my career.

140
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,829
You can't let this end your career. Get a grip.

141
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,500
All right. Focus.

142
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,029
I can do this.

143
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,470
You can't go down like this. No, Young Sim.

144
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,730
You'd see this kind of twist only in cartoons.

145
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,470
Gosh. This is totally worn out.

146
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,110
Darn it.

147
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,309
My fingers are hurting too. I can't draw now.

148
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:38,649
Goodness. Oh, my.

149
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,720
Give them to me.

150
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,019
Are they that heavy?

151
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,189
No. They aren't that heavy.

152
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,059
These bags represent your love and hard effort.

153
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,929
I will make sure Young Sim gets them.

154
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,230
Goodness. You really have a way with words. How kind of you.

155
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,440
I also packed up some fried fishcake,

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,440
your favourite.

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,079
Really? Thank you.

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,480
I really love fried fishcake.

159
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,779
Hello, Father.

160
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,250
"Father?"

161
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,789
I'm not your father.

162
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,158
You told me to call you that the last time we met.

163
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,659
When did I say that?

164
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:24,829
Gosh, Dad. Why are you acting...

165
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,059
- like that all of a sudden? - What?

166
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,169
It's getting late. Don't mind him. You should go.

167
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,370
Okay. I'll get going then.

168
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,840
Thank you.

169
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,369
What was that? Seriously. Go inside.

170
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,210
- What about my son-in-law? - Gosh. Go inside. Come on.

171
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,080
Gosh. Dad.

172
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,149
Why are you suddenly so mean to Chae Dong?

173
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,889
Kyung Tae is back.

174
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,360
Kyung Tae is a good match for Young Sim.

175
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,729
But still. What you did was wrong.

176
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,799
- Unbelievable. - Gosh. Forget it.

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,659
What is Young Sim doing these days? Why isn't she coming home lately?

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,268
Young Sim...

179
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:04,870
is busy trying to launch a new show.

180
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,969
Gosh. I heard there was a chance...

181
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,970
she had to resign because of some problem.

182
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,070
Did everything get sorted out?

183
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,480
That's the problem she has to fix.

184
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,080
So she has to work hard...

185
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,379
with Kyung Tae. I mean, Mark.

186
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:19,950
What does that mean? She has to be with Kyung Tae?

187
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,320
No.

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,519
Young Sim and Kyung Tae...

189
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,759
are going to make a reality dating show or something.

190
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,559
A reality dating show?

191
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,330
My goodness. That's music to my ears!

192
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,029
Why, Dad?

193
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,870
He humiliated her in front of the whole country.

194
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,638
So she threw him over her shoulders. You were there when it happened.

195
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,439
How is that music to your ears?

196
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,038
The two of them are meant to be.

197
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm not sure about that.

198
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,480
To be honest, I'm really worried...

199
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,080
because...

200
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,220
everyone at work knows that Mark holds grudges.

201
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,489
What's so bad about that?

202
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,389
It's fine as long as men are successful.

203
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,418
Right!

204
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,329
The best kind of man is a successful man.

205
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,990
- Gosh. - After meeting Chae Dong today,

206
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,230
I realized that a cute and affectionate guy...

207
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,570
like Chae Dong would be great for Young Sim too.

208
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,168
By the way, Chae Dong seemed like a normal guy.

209
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,610
Unless something was wrong with him, how could he end up with Young Sim?

210
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,039
What's so awful about Young Sim?

211
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,508
I didn't mean it like that.

212
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,679
- Gosh. - Young Sim's partner is Kyung Tae.

213
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,779
Goodness.

214
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,490
Someone like Chae Dong would be great for Young Sim too.

215
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:33,490
Kyung Tae's partner is Young Sim.

216
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,960
Dad, I'm talking about Chae Dong.

217
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,230
Could I borrow some money for the bus?

218
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,139
Excuse me.

219
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,210
Excuse me. I lost my wallet.

220
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,679
Could I borrow some money for the bus?

221
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,649
I see.

222
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,258
- Excuse me. I have a job interview. - Yes?

223
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,259
But I lost my wallet.

224
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,329
Could I borrow some money for a taxi?

225
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,369
- Sorry. - I'll wire you the money...

226
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,500
- as soon as I'm done. - Sorry, I can't.

227
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,309
Excuse me. I have a job interview.

228
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:29,080
Excuse me. I lost my wallet.

229
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,549
Hey.

230
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,590
I'll lend you the money.

231
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,159
How much do you need?

232
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,399
Hold on.

233
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:56,039
I'm late for my job interview.

234
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,809
I'll wire you the money as soon as I'm done.

235
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,839
You can take your time.

236
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,408
No. You don't have to pay me back.

237
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,480
I won't hunt you down.

238
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,879
I should pay you back. I promise.

239
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,720
Thank you.

240
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,960
Wait.

241
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,860
First impressions are important.

242
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,399
(Employee Card, Oh Young Sim)

243
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,840
I heard the job market was pretty tough these days.

244
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,309
I hope you get this job.

245
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,009
And...

246
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,649
if the interviewers pressure you and make you uncomfortable,

247
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,220
just pretend that some jerks are barking at you.

248
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,129
Just say whatever you want to say.

249
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,429
Don't let them intimidate you.

250
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,759
You got this.

251
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,899
Let's go.

252
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,379
That day,

253
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,049
she probably cried her eyes out after losing her show.

254
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,889
Young Sim always moves me at unexpected moments.

255
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,960
I should bring this to her before it gets cold.

256
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:38,509
Gosh.

257
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,450
She's working really hard.

258
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,590
Did you go to my house?

259
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,159
Yes. Goodness. You and your keen sense of smell.

260
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,639
Young Sim, slow down.

261
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,509
I don't have time.

262
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,409
I need to eat and rewrite the proposal.

263
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:20,080
Who knew I would be making two dating shows in my career?

264
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,189
Besides, there are so many similar dating shows now.

265
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,460
I don't know how to make mine stand out.

266
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,029
Take it easy.

267
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,128
You work, so you can have a good life.

268
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,830
I want to create an awesome show this time.

269
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,330
- Young Sim. - Yes.

270
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,710
But do we have to work with that guy, Wang Kyung Tae?

271
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,879
Yes. We have to.

272
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,980
Actually,

273
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,749
I wouldn't have had this chance...

274
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,250
if it hadn't been for Wang Kyung Tae.

275
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,820
I'm sorry. I'm putting you through a lot. Right?

276
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,519
No. It's not that.

277
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,629
To be honest, I was meaning to ask you.

278
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,000
What was your relationship with Wang Kyung Tae...

279
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,630
in the past?

280
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,268
Seriously? It smells amazing.

281
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,439
- No way! It looks great. - Come.

282
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,068
Sit down. Have some.

283
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,009
- Hey, can you take out some plates? - Yes.

284
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,909
It's really good.

285
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,139
I might not be the best senior you have,

286
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,008
but I can at least give you a lot of food.

287
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,279
Have some. It's tasty.

288
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,650
Thank you.

289
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,419
Did you know?

290
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,479
You can find ideal couples based on MBTI types.

291
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,689
- Really? - Yes. What's your MBTI type?

292
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,618
Was it INFJ?

293
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,589
Really? I see.

294
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,730
I'm home.

295
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
It's been so long since I got to lie down in my bed.

296
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,069
Why are you working so hard?

297
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,710
Do you have that much work?

298
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,140
Goodness.

299
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,180
Who knew I would be making a show with Wang Kyung Tae?

300
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,789
Seriously. You never know where life will take you.

301
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,960
I can never let my guard down.

302
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,119
You're right about that.

303
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,329
Who would have thought that Kyung Tae would be my boss?

304
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,769
Either way. What are you planning to do from now on?

305
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,670
For now, until the program is finalized,

306
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,269
I'm going to at least pretend to die if that's what he tells me to do.

307
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,140
Why are you being so extreme?

308
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,549
Can't you just quit?

309
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,079
I get the feeling that acting out like that...

310
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,849
might eventually lead to being unable to do anything.

311
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,720
This time,

312
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,159
no matter how gross and uncomfortable it gets,

313
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,230
I'm going to hold it all in and try to overcome it.

314
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,759
You sound like a real grown-up.

315
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,529
It's awkward.

316
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:52,000
Kyung Tae and I left things in an odd way 20 years ago.

317
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,740
I'd like to get over that too.

318
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,809
I don't think avoiding him is the answer.

319
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,349
By the way, Young Sim,

320
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,420
Kyung Tae suddenly came back after 20 years away.

321
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,450
Does that seem like a coincidence to you?

322
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,990
Does anything come to mind when you see Kyung Tae?

323
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,759
Well, for now,

324
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,759
I'm just going to accept it and not think of anything.

325
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,200
That keeps things simple.

326
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,940
This time, I'll let my pride and fitness...

327
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,940
get fired up.

328
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:28,970
Of course, Young Sim.

329
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,640
You're just as indifferent as your name implies.

330
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,450
Yes. At the end of the day, he's Kyung Tae, and I'm Young Sim.

331
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,950
I've made a start now.

332
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,289
I won't back down!

333
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,789
(Three days later)

334
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,490
Hello.

335
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,399
Come on. At least let us pass.

336
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,069
Why are you blocking the way?

337
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,710
Sorry, boss.

338
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,339
Come on in. I'm getting some work done.

339
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,750
This is amazing.

340
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,389
Do you live alone in this mansion?

341
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,049
Yes. I'll be living here while I'm in Korea.

342
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,230
My gosh. You've really made it.

343
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,299
- Take a seat here. - What? Okay.

344
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,299
Enough of that.

345
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:06,670
I trust you've brought me some good ideas.

346
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,069
I have the overall outline in place.

347
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,409
But I think it still needs a special something.

348
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,809
So I need a little more time.

349
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,480
We have no time.

350
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,480
Producer Oh?

351
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
What is the core element of dating shows to you?

352
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,559
The core element?

353
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,690
You've been a participant so try to think from that perspective.

354
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,630
The core element?

355
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,869
I guess figuring out how the other person feels...

356
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,710
would be a core element.

357
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,109
If you can figure out if someone is interested...

358
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,519
and how they actually feel,

359
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,349
I think that would lower the chances...

360
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,589
of failed relationships too.

361
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,160
You wouldn't have to waste time...

362
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,690
making wild guesses and being deluded.

363
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,359
But isn't that what makes it fun?

364
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,529
If you know everything,

365
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,730
where's the fun in that?

366
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,099
But...

367
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,470
I guess you're right.

368
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,609
It may just be a show,

369
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:23,109
but emotions can't lie.

370
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,950
Unless you're determined to be deceptive,

371
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,650
I think it's best to be honest.

372
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,789
Then you wouldn't even hesitate to approach each other.

373
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,829
Do you really think it's possible...

374
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,369
for people to be plainly honest?

375
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,839
Then, let's put it to the test.

376
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,380
Let's see how honest we can be.

377
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,619
I'm curious about something.

378
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:06,019
Why did you decide to participate in our show?

379
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,130
I have a question too.

380
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,069
Why did you...

381
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,140
choose me in the final round?

382
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,779
That was...

383
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,519
because you were...

384
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,150
Watch out!

385
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,959
Oh, my goodness. This can't be!

386
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,059
Young Sim! Our poor Young Sim!

387
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,599
It's not her, is it? It can't be.

388
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:54,400
I can't let you leave me like this!

389
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:55,740
Father!

390
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,979
I've never done her any favours as a brother-in-law.

391
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,650
- No. It can't be. - I'm sorry, Young Sim!

392
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,750
We haven't even seen her face. Just a moment.

393
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,019
Excuse me. We're looking for Oh Young Sim.

394
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,348
She's quite pale and looks unsophisticated.

395
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,159
Do you know where she is?

396
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,890
- Oh Young Sim? - Yes.

397
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,500
She's in the outpatient clinic.

398
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,899
- "Outpatient?" - Yes.

399
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,369
The outpatient clinic?

400
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,069
- It's that way, right? - Yes.

401
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,268
- Let's go. - Oh, my.

402
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,069
My Young Sim!

403
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,509
Ms. Oh, you have some bruising on your back and knees.

404
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,109
And Mr. Wang,

405
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,750
you are exhibiting some minor symptoms of concussion.

406
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,079
- Concussion? - He has a concussion?

407
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,990
Thankfully, you won't need to be admitted.

408
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,420
But to be safe, you must rest completely.

409
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,189
And his guardian should take very good care of him.

410
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,160
"Guardian." All right.

411
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,559
If you have any issues, make an appointment to see a doctor.

412
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,369
You're fine to go home today.

413
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,240
Doctor. Are you sure I'm all right?

414
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,008
- Doctor, I'm just... - His nose is bleeding. Is he okay?

415
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,278
- Yes. He's fine to go home. - He says you're fine. What's wrong?

416
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,939
- Please call my mom. - Never mind that.

417
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,009
Nurse?

418
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:09,880
Thank you.

419
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,619
Let's go. This way.

420
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,289
I'm bleeding!

421
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,220
My poor sister.

422
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,589
There's Young Sim!

423
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,229
Where? Young Sim?

424
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,430
- She's right there. - Oh, my goodness!

425
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,028
- Young Sim! - Oh, my gosh!

426
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,199
- Oh, no! My Young Sim! - Young Sim!

427
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,399
We were so worried about you! What happened?

428
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,669
- Are you all right? - What is all this?

429
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,639
Young Sim, are you hurt?

430
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm fine. I'm okay. We're in a hospital. Keep it down.

431
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,380
All right, then.

432
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,750
Why does it seem like Kyung Tae is more hurt?

433
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,879
Right. Apparently Kyung Tae...

434
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,749
has mild concussion symptoms, but they said he was fine.

435
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,990
- A concussion? - Father!

436
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,420
Hey. Shouldn't he be admitted if he has a concussion?

437
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,289
They said he was fine. He just needs some looking after.

438
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,500
- His nose is bleeding too! - He doesn't look fine.

439
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,368
It's fine. This was from before. He's fine.

440
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:06,740
(Young Eun Hospital)

441
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,139
Just come back home with us.

442
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,179
You can't go home,

443
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,210
and there's no one you can call on right now.

444
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,849
I'm honestly fine. I can stay in a hotel.

445
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,289
They may be mild, but you still have symptoms of a concussion.

446
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,890
What if you're all alone...

447
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,619
and you go into shock with a brain bleed?

448
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,089
He said he was fine.

449
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,430
Don't say that! It's late and he has nowhere to go.

450
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,930
He's hurt too. We can't let him go alone.

451
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,299
I guess our place would be better than a hotel.

452
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,868
She's right. The doctor said to keep an eye on you too.

453
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:45,109
So just do whatever you prefer.

454
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,609
Of course, he prefers coming home.

455
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,680
Come on. Let's just go home.

456
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,210
Yes. Come with us.

457
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,220
I'm really honestly fine.

458
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,719
You're not fine at all!

459
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,518
We need to help each other out in times of need.

460
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,259
It's not like we're strangers.

461
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,558
Also, you used to stay at our place...

462
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,559
for days when you were young.

463
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,629
What's with all of you? He says he's fine.

464
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,630
He doesn't want to go, so let him be.

465
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,269
Not necessarily...

466
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,279
If that's not the case,

467
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,639
it would be rude of you to decline...

468
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,750
when your elders are going this far.

469
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,519
Dad, what's with you?

470
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,019
Then...

471
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,660
I'll stay for a brief while.

472
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,430
Good thinking.

473
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:41,970
Great. I'm glad.

474
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,309
By the way, what happened?

475
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,309
How did the wall collapse?

476
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,979
My place is under renovation.

477
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,880
I think there was a bit of an issue.

478
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,380
Thank goodness it's not any worse.

479
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,849
By the way, how did you hurt your head?

480
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,890
Well... I can't remember clearly.

481
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,299
I was certain I was with Young Sim.

482
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:16,630
Why did you...

483
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:19,740
choose me in the final round?

484
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,339
That was...

485
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,309
because you were...

486
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,410
Watch out!

487
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,049
Kyung Tae!

488
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,089
That's my girl. You're strong when in danger.

489
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,359
But you work out all the time.

490
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:18,500
It looks like you owe my sister.

491
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,069
I have pretty good reflexes.

492
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,440
Your penthouse is really nice, but it's poorly constructed.

493
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,940
Why would such a big bookshelf fall?

494
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,009
The more perfect something looks, the bigger the fault it has.

495
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,730
Use this room for the next while.

496
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,359
It looks empty since it's our office,

497
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,900
but it's clean.

498
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,599
It's really nice.

499
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,200
Here, use them as your pyjamas.

500
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,069
They're my favourite items.

501
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,170
- Thank you. - No problem.

502
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,909
He has to rest, so let's leave him.

503
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,879
- Sure. - Rest well. Let's hurry up and go.

504
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,940
I hope you like them.

505
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,900
I can't believe they still use blankets like this.

506
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,819
I'm so uncomfortable.

507
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,160
Very uncomfortable.

508
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,680
(Young Sim)

509
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,329
Why isn't she picking up?

510
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,599
Did something happen?

511
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,130
It's me, Chae Dong.

512
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,499
Come on in, Chae Dong.

513
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,900
- Hello. - Hi.

514
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,739
Where is Young Sim?

515
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,380
Young Sim? She's upstairs.

516
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,539
Okay.

517
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,019
Why are you here?

518
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,089
It's complicated, but he'll stay here for a while.

519
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,318
I'm just thankful...

520
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,829
since you treat me like family.

521
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,730
I won't forget your kindness.

522
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,240
Aren't you going home?

523
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:14,940
Are you going to keep standing there?

524
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,180
Jin Sim, can I join you for lunch?

525
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,709
Of course.

526
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,250
What would you like to eat, dear Chae Dong?

527
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:25,650
"Dear Chae Dong?"

528
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,078
Chae Dong is wondering...

529
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,390
if he can eat your delicious pork galbi.

530
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,919
Of course.

531
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,589
- I can make some pork galbi. - Right?

532
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:37,930
- Just wait. - Thank you.

533
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,338
- Enjoy, everyone. - Thank you.

534
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,880
- Thank you for the food. - Look at that meat.

535
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:07,160
This meat is crazy. You marinated it so well.

536
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,190
Didn't you say you were on a diet?

537
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,828
I need to eat something like this to get better fast.

538
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:15,470
It's full of protein.

539
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,669
This is delicious, Jin Sim.

540
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,969
It's better than my mom's.

541
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,939
Chae Dong, you're eating so well.

542
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,380
That's because this is delicious.

543
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,149
Gosh. It's going to taste amazing...

544
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,180
with this lettuce.

545
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,890
Gosh.

546
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,699
This is organic lettuce, isn't it?

547
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,160
It's organic.

548
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,230
Young Sim.

549
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,849
Is it okay to stay so long at someone's place?

550
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:11,519
It's normally considered rude.

551
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,690
I have something to talk about with Young Sim.

552
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,130
It's fine.

553
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,730
We can talk about work at work.

554
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,139
You shouldn't stick around too. You should go.

555
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,909
She's right. You can visit again soon.

556
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,920
I let my guard down for a day and this happens.

557
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,989
Wang Kyung Tae means business.

558
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,230
What? Hey, Ji Yu.

559
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,369
Hello.

560
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:03,510
Hi.

561
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,480
It must be tough to study.

562
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,050
Did you eat?

563
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,480
Yes, I ate near my class.

564
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm glad.

565
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,719
I'll treat you to something nice on a weekend sometime.

566
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,519
I promise.

567
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,059
Okay.

568
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,198
- Take care. - Bye.

569
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,269
Wait, Ji Yu.

570
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,769
Hey.

571
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,639
Can I ask you for a favour?

572
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,679
I ate too much.

573
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:44,380
It has been long since I ate like that.

574
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,420
Gosh.

575
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,389
This place...

576
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,119
hasn't changed at all.

577
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,360
I don't know if I can digest everything.

578
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,739
I have indigestion.

579
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,920
("Gu Wol and Relationships")

580
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,959
He's overdue for a call.

581
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,360
Is Kyung Tae that busy?

582
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,499
It went viral.

583
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,170
There is no way he wouldn't get in touch with me.

584
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,440
(Mark Wang)

585
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,010
This is impossible.

586
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:53,079
Should I text him first?

587
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,420
(Kyung Tae...)

588
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,860
No. Wait, Gu Wol Sook.

589
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,130
You have pride.

590
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:08,000
Wol Sook, what should be the concept for your content next month?

591
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,429
We already covered most, right?

592
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,538
Yes. We covered at least twice,

593
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:15,400
if not three times, on most relationship themes.

594
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,609
I came up with a great idea.

595
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,909
Why don't I recruit Kingvely?

596
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,079
That would be huge.

597
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,579
Will you ask him yourself?

598
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,250
Do you still keep in contact?

599
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,360
Of course.

600
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,760
I'll leave it to you, then.

601
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:46,199
I wonder if Young Sim knows what he's up to these days.

602
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,119
I'm thirsty.

603
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,070
That's refreshing.

604
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,210
You know you have three days, right?

605
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,880
Is your proposal ready?

606
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,980
How far along are you?

607
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,780
Did you check all the references?

608
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,260
Gosh. No wonder he is a CEO.

609
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,260
He won't stop pressuring me.

610
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,299
Make sure Kingvely's logo is clear...

611
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,800
and visible for a long time.

612
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,340
Do it yourself.

613
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,039
He's so selfish.

614
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:35,280
He's making me do all the work.

615
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,819
(Gu Wol Sook)

616
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,980
"Gu Wol Sook?"

617
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,550
What is this?

618
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:52,530
Should I pick it up or not?

619
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:01,639
Hello?

620
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,340
What took you so long to answer?

621
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:05,570
Gu Wol Sook.

622
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:09,349
If you called to apologize...

623
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,249
There's no apologizing when it comes to romance.

624
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,380
That's childish.

625
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,619
I almost got fired because of you two.

626
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,718
Don't you know the number of views doubled...

627
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,360
after the controversy?

628
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,190
It's natural for gossip to follow popularity.

629
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,059
Just like me.

630
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,670
All you and Kyung Tae think about are ways to make me angry.

631
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,038
I'm busy.

632
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,070
Gosh. I called to ask about Kyung Tae.

633
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:39,909
Do you know what he's up to these days?

634
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:42,079
Don't tell me...

635
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,949
you two are planning something behind my back.

636
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,719
What do you mean?

637
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:51,289
The one you're looking for is at my place now.

638
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:52,518
Kyung Tae?

639
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,590
Why on earth is he there? Since when?

640
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,789
Why is he at your place?

641
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,969
If you intend on taking him away, you're more than welcome.

642
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,469
What?

643
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,360
Did everyone go out?

644
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,869
Gosh, it's hot.

645
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,309
Darn it.

646
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,308
It hurts my pride,

647
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,320
but I'm the one who needs him.

648
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,449
I can go even further than this.

649
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,690
One needs to win over love.

650
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,630
What? Chae Dong, what are you doing here?

651
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,400
Hello. What about you?

652
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,269
I have to call dibs on something.

653
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,538
By the way,

654
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,539
why are you visiting a colleague at a time like this?

655
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,639
I also have something to pass to Young Sim, so I'm dropping by.

656
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:25,409
What is it? I'll pass it on to her.

657
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:27,219
Could it be...

658
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
love?

659
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:32,219
You'll wake everyone up.

660
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,760
You're a producer, right?

661
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,829
Producer.

662
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,868
Did you know that your eyes...

663
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,400
and mine are very similar right now?

664
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,909
In my opinion,

665
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,340
we want the same thing.

666
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,949
Shall we...

667
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,578
become partners?

668
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,150
I think I can help you a lot.

669
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:05,889
Gosh.

670
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,889
What are you doing?

671
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,289
Why are you scared?

672
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,340
Why is it so hot outside?

673
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,280
Gosh.

674
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,590
Soon Sim, did you bring the bath bomb?

675
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,190
- What is this? - What?

676
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:16,630
(Oh! YoungSim)

677
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:18,289
There's something between you.

678
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,659
Usually, my hunches are right.

679
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,069
Mr. Wang, when do you plan to leave her place?

680
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,500
It has nothing to do with you.

681
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,070
I'll force you out if you don't.

682
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,199
Excuse me.

683
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,739
We should go to a workshop.

684
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,739
It's still nice to get out after a while.

685
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,550
We'll start the games.

686
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,250
Chae Dong, flip him over!

687
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:41,820
I'm almost done.

688
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:44,289
- Work vacation! - Work vacation!

689
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,320
Why did you suddenly disappear...

690
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,130
without a word?
