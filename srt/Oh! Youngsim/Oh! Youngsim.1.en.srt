00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,669
Young Sim, why are you going so fast?

12
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,799
Wait for us.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,708
Why are you wasting your energy?

14
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,370
It's so childish.

15
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:44,909
I'm going to go ahead.

16
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,750
- Young Sim! Wait!
- Young Sim, wait for us!

(Episode 1: One Is One, Not Two)

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,009
Yo Han, please appear on our show.

19
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,408
An idol like you is perfect for our show.

20
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,779
I heard you trained as a
cyclist until middle school,

21
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,556
and your big brother was
a professional cyclist.

22
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,620
How did you find that out?

23
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,419
You have athlete's blood...

24
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,559
running in you.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,590
We really need idols like you on our show.

26
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,658
Please join us just once.
I'll make sure you look good.

27
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,860
I'll turn you into a top star.

28
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,699
I already told you, no.

29
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,069
Can you please stop following me?

30
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,370
You're so persistent.

31
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,810
It wasn't easy getting here.
I can't leave now.

32
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,008
- Ms. Producer.
- Yes?

33
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,050
You can't change my mind.

34
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,150
It's all useless. Just leave.

35
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,688
How about this?

36
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,089
If I make it to that
bridge faster than you,

37
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,159
agree to appear on our show.
Okay? Are you in?

38
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,300
Do you think that's possible?

39
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,300
But what if I win?

40
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,270
Then I'll appear on the show.

41
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,900
Although it's highly unlikely.

42
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,740
Okay.

43
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,870
You have to keep your promise.

44
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,879
I'm relying on you, knees.

45
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,780
All right. In 3, 2...

46
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,819
I'm going to successfully
cast you this time.

47
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,139
Hey, are you okay?

48
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,159
You're really something.

49
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:13,930
Fine, I give up.

50
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,759
I'll go on the show.

51
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,879
I can do it...

52
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,180
I can do it...

53
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,560
I can do it.

54
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,430
I can do it.

55
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,600
Sir, would you like some dessert?

56
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,180
Yes.

57
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,420
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,670
(One is one, not two.)

59
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,209
What is this?

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,050
- Hey.
- I'm glad you're here.

61
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,619
- Are you all right?
- I got Han Yo Han to agree.

62
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,250
I sacrificed myself to do it.

63
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,490
- He agreed? Gosh.
- Wait...

64
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,780
- It was worth giving up my knees.
- You're getting a call.

65
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,060
Hey. Hold on.

66
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,729
I have a bad feeling about this.

67
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,890
Can you take this to my desk?

68
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,040
Hello, Director Heo.

69
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,439
Your show will be cancelled.

70
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,939
What?

71
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,179
What? How could you do this...

72
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,208
without saying a word to me?

73
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,350
This is unspeakable.

74
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:18,419
Just this morning, I got
permission from Han Yo Han,

75
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,449
the hottest idol right
now, to appear on my show.

76
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,648
You can't do this to me.

77
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,060
What will this make me?

78
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,889
The higher-ups made the decision
during the reorganization.

79
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,230
It was out of my hands.

80
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,889
I won't accept it.

81
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,360
What are you going to do
about it if you don't?

82
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,670
I should fight against them.

83
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,629
Come on.

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,399
Why is it always my show that
gets cancelled every time?

85
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,310
Why do you think?

86
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,439
You're lucky they went
easy on you until now.

87
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,910
You wrote enough apology letters
to cover our whole station.

88
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,679
We asked you to make a variety show,

89
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,250
not a detective series.

95
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,929
Thanks to you,

96
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,930
I won't die a natural death.

97
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,199
Please don't gather attention
by doing things like this.

98
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,239
Your show needs to do
the attention-grabbing.

99
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,869
How can I sit still in
a situation like that?

100
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,040
Justice comes first.

101
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,878
More than a stimulating show,

102
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,519
justice comes first. That's what I think.

103
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,480
- Oh Young Sim.
- Yes?

104
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,179
You're not producing cultural shows.

105
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,790
You're in charge of
entertainment shows. Okay?

106
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:29,189
I know that.

107
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,819
Anyway,

108
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,958
I think the decision this time
is a means to take care...

109
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,929
of the passion no one asks for.

110
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,959
No one...

111
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:40,800
Please, think of my position too.

112
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,839
Although I might have a temper,

113
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,470
I still get hurt!

114
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,209
I'm about to cry...

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm really about to cry.
I have to hold it in.

116
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,049
Look at that.

117
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,149
It's so fake.

118
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,980
I'm saying this so you'll get hurt.

119
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,649
Please don't do anything for a while.

120
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,189
Get out of here!

121
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,930
Excuse me.

122
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,090
Are you in the middle of a conversation?

123
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,970
Yes, it's something important.
Give us a minute.

124
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,338
No.

125
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,199
- Please come in, Hee Jin.
- Okay.

126
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,609
I'm sorry, Young Sim.

127
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,410
I'm starting a new show this time.

128
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:26,709
- I see.
- Right.

129
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,009
- Hey.
- Yes?

130
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,720
Hee Jin will début this time.

131
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,519
Congratulations.

132
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,119
How are the preparations going?

133
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
- Well, of course.
- Good.

134
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,139
Well...

135
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,539
Your junior is debuting faster than you.

136
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,009
How do you feel?

137
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,309
Gil Dong.

138
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,209
- It's Director Heo.
- Gil Dong.

139
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,649
Call me Director Heo.

140
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,820
- Gil Dong.
- What?

141
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
You're against every show I plan.

142
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,888
Now you're taking away the little I have.

143
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,590
That's why I'm in this situation.
Please help me out.

144
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,029
- Oh Young Sim.
- What?

145
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,960
It's a jungle out there.

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,730
The only way to survive is to forage.

147
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,330
Darn it.

148
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,399
I know that.

149
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,110
But what am I going to do now?

150
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,979
If I really don't do
anything like you want,

151
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,380
you'll kick me out for not working.

152
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,149
At least you still have
a bit of sense in you.

153
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,690
What are you doing? Get out!

154
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,250
Get out of my face!

155
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,629
Why are you yelling? I'll get going!

156

("The Arrows of Love")

157
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,129
What?

158
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,829
- What? Hey.
- What is this?

159
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,369
Wait.

160
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,069
- I see.
- No.

161
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,808
This is a new proposal. It
has nothing to do with you.

162
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,569
I see.

163
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,808
It's the one that's on hold
because you don't have anyone.

164
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:06,940
I'll do it.

165
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,408
- You?
- Yes.

166
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,119
No. It's okay. I'll find someone else.

167
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,750
No.

168
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,849
I know what dating is about.
I'm good at it.

169
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,058
Once I get into it,
I can get really intense.

170
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,960
I'll do a good job.

171
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,490
No. You don't know anything.

172
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,528
You don't know what dating is.

173
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,659
You shouldn't know.

174
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,230
You're doing a reality dating show?

175
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,269
Yes.

176
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,210
I chose to do it in order to
survive in this cold-hearted jungle.

177
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,610
It'll air as a pilot episode.

178
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,440
"The Arrows of Love?"

179
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,350
A reality dating show won't be easy.

180
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:46,080
By the way, when were you
last in a relationship?

181
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,720
- Maybe three...
- Hey.

182
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,059
That's not important.

183
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,029
I told you. A show must be truthful.
That's what's important.

184
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,959
Don't do the show if you don't want to.

185
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,799
- Don't do it.
- No.

186
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:02,970
That's not what I mean.

187
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,500
I'll help you. Don't worry.

188
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,840
I knew it. You'll help, right?

189
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,880
I really have to do a good job this time.

190
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,710
I was close to getting fired earlier.

191
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,950
While we're on that...

192
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,250
What do you think is key
to a reality dating show?

193
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,720
The key?

194
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,720
In my opinion,

195
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,360
the key to a reality dating show is...

196
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,830
Characters are key, and
they're the drama itself.

197
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,469
What?

198
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,699
If there is someone so
attractive to shake me up,

199
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,769
all else is useless.

200
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,340
Where on earth am I going to find
an attractive ordinary person?

201
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,679
Exactly.

202
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,779
It'd be hard to find someone right away.

203
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,449
Also, we have to be careful
who we put on the show...

204
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,755
in case they have a controversial history.

205
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,490
Darn it.

206
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,590
Sorry I always trouble you
with protecting my forehead.

207
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,059
I keep telling you. You'll hurt yourself.

208
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,429
Don't be so reckless with your head.

209
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,499
It's because I can't think.

210
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,159
I don't know where to start.

211
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,529
Right.

212
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,139
Connections exist for situations like this.

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,110
"Connections?"

214
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,039
I'm not sure if it'll work, but let me try.

215
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,980
I'll contact my friends too.

216
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:21,980
No!

217
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,049
I'm the best at casting.

218
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,480
I'll try to take care of it.

219
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I can do this.

220
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,490
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

221
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,320
- You can do it.
- Let's go. Go.

222
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,590
There's no one to contact.

223
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,658
She's going to say no too.

224
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,269
Oh Young Sim won't make it.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,240
But did you hear?

226
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,070
She's going to work on that pilot show.

227
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,370
What?

228
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,440
She never gets tired, does she?

229
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,350
Why does the director
always go so easy on her?

230
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,778
If a junior of mine débuts before me,

231
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,149
I would automatically leave.

232
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:02,789
She has no pride.

233
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,119
If she's sensible enough,

234
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
she'll leave after the pilot show.

235
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,690
They're downsizing the department.

236
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,659
But why does Chae Dong keep
on following her around?

237
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,899
It's bad for his image.

238
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,500
Maybe the rumour about
borrowing money is true.

239
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,139
- You must be right.
- Right? Do you think so?

240
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,740
That has got to be it.

241
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,080
Thank you so much for worrying about me.

242
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,519
Since it came to this,
I'll really work my best.

243
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,649
You.

244
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,789
You should try your best too.

245
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,620
Good luck.

246
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,490
("The Arrows of Love")

247
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,859
(Currently named Oh Ha Yoon,
Previously named Oh Soon Sim)

248
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,500
You're bringing me down too.
What's the matter?

249
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,000
Cheer up.

250
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,840
It seems like...

251
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,970
my luck with variety shows ended.

252
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Did you...

253
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,480
ever have luck with it?

254
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,350
Don't you remember?

255
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,989
The cartoon "YoungSim"...

256
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,159
made me famous nationwide 20 years ago.

257
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,399
I guess my childhood was a
bit messy thanks to that.

258
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,230
Anyway,

259
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,870
I used up all of my fame back then.

260
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,139
Let's see...

261
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,439
From your perspective...

262
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,609
(May Monthly Fortune)

263
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,909
If you go east,

264
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,650
you'll meet someone important.

265
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,219
This is your fortune for this month.

266
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,320
"East?" From my perspective?

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,789
This is west.

268
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,029
Then east...

269
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,330
You're east to me.

270
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,730
Gosh.

271
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,409
Are you interested in appearing on a show?

272
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,070
Me?

273
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,309
Are you asking me to appear
on a show you're making?

274
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,980
No, thank you.

275
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,888
Are you looking down on me too?

276
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,720
You should say yes when
your sister asks you.

277
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,759
It's like getting a
scarlet letter for life...

278
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,229
if you go on the wrong show.

279
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,589
You know that better than anyone.

280
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,629
I won't do it.

281
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:02,529
On top of that, I'll be
switching jobs next week.

282
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:05,070
It wouldn't be a good idea to go on air.

283
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,870
- You're changing jobs?
- Yes.

284
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,269
Ta-Da.

285
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,079
Come down for dinner.

286
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,549
- Okay.
- Okay.

287
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,919
Gosh.

288
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,019
Is it a special day or something?

289
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,989
How can an aunt be so careless?

290
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,860
It's Ji Woo's birthday today.

291
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,029
Lee Ji Woo.

292
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,470
Is it your birthday today?

293
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,240
No reaction.

294
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,169
She hit puberty. Be understanding.

295
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,679
Why is a young girl wearing so much makeup?

296
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,279
She's interested in her
appearance these days.

297
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,080
Right, Ji Woo?

298
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,649
I wouldn't wear makeup
if I was pretty as Mom.

299
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,690
Who do I take after?

300
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,400
It's 8pm.

301
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,230
All right. Let's eat.

302
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,308
By the way,

303
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,946
how come no one goes out
on dates on their days off?

304
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,880
- What?
- What?

305
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,250
Young Sim. Don't you have a date?

306
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,079
No way. What date?

307
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,279
She doesn't even update her phone.

308
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,689
It's not like she's ugly.

309
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,190
She has a job too. She has it all.

310
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,430
I wonder why she can't get a date.

311
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,400
She doesn't have it all.

312
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,059
That's why she doesn't have a man.

313
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,700
You called me a muse when you used to draw.

314
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,410
This is partially your fault.

315
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,609
What does my cartoon have
to do with you dating?

316
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,980
I told you 3,000 times.

317
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,449
Everyone I meet asks me to sing the song.

318
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,190
They also ask if Soon Sim is pretty.

319
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,489
They just think...

320
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,859
I'm some funny character from a cartoon.

321
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,589
Gosh.

322
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,299
I have been raising you for over 30 years,

323
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,430
but if anything goes wrong,
it's the parent's fault.

324
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,230
Gosh.

325
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,740
Dad...

326
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,410
Why did you say that?

327
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,440
It's the truth, though.

328
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,980
What's with Dad?

329
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,679
Male menopause. It's the hormones.

330
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,119
- Just eat.
- Gosh.

331
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,669
("14-Year-Old Young Sim" by Oh Dae Kwang)

332
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,700
The power of inspiration left me.

333
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,900
It's about time it returns to me.

334
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,259
The deadline is tomorrow.

335
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,089
How come I can't find any inspiration?

336
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,299
My stars, you know it's the
mid-term exams tomorrow, right?

337
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,240
Oh, my. You already know, and
I should quickly say my wishes?

338
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,609
Please make everything I studied...

339
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,049
appear on the exam tomorrow.

340
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,950
In doing so, the smug kids,
Wol Sook and Kyung Tae,

341
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,049
can finally be humbled.

342
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,759
I'm sure it's a very
easy task for my stars.

343
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,519
Isn't it?

344
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,000
I know she's my daughter,
but she's so ridiculous.

345
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,269
Young Sim.

346
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,539
Gosh. Where did she even come from?

347
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Wait.

348
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,890
Of course. This is it!

349
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,029
An unforeseen adolescent character
who's in her own little world.

350
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,810
I was staring right at it this whole time.

351
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,900
That's right.

352
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,230
The creator of the "YoungSim" comics...

353
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,369
is none other than my father, Dae Kwang.

354
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,210
I played all day!

355
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,889
(Let's become kind and honest people.)

356
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,808
Wait. What has happened here?

357
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,009
(Korean Language)

358
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,508
Oh, my gosh. My stars!

359
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,849
None of the things I
studied are on this exam!

360
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,519
I can't see a thing.

361
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,390
I have no other choice now.

362
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,358
Thank you, my stars.

363
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,700
I rolled a four!

364
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,329
My stars on the left, and
Young Sim on the right.

365
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,970
Rock, paper, scissors!

366
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:08,410
(Let's become kind and honest people.)

367
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,409
I've failed this exam too.

368
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,180
The highest scorer on the
mid-terms is Oh Young Sim.

369
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,519
The final question is about the
writer of this three-verse poem.

370
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,450
The purpose of planting a
phoenix tree is to see...

371
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,160
I know. Hwang Jin Yi!

372
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,359
Incorrect.

373
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,160
- Jung Chul!
- Incorrect.

374
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,890
I know! Lee Doo Bo!

375
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,558
- Incorrect!
- It's not Lee Doo Bo?

376
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,598
Obviously not.

377
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,829
What do I do now?

378
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,000
I've never heard any of it before.

379
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,900
The final chance to
answer goes to Young Sim.

380
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,839
- Young Sim?
- Well, we're here now.

381
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,368
I'll just go for it.

382
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,880
Yes, Young Sim?

383
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,609
Who wrote this three-verse poem?

384
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,049
I don't know.

385
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,119
Oh, you don't know.

386
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,579
Author unknown.

387
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,549
Yes! That's correct!

388
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,089
Congratulations.

389
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,719
What is with Young Sim?

390
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,789
How is she always so lucky?

391
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,729
So, if I sit here like this,

392
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,050
my future husband's face will
appear in the mirror, right?

393
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,140
What happens if he does
appear, and he's ugly?

394
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,339
Why is it taking so long?

395
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,380
What are you doing, Young Sim?

396
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:30,048
Darn. What's wrong with me?

397
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,119
Don't tell me...

398
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,720
Is that meant to be me?

399
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Yes.

400
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:36,459
Why would you use...

401
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,299
my story and likeness
without my permission?

402
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,869
Are you just going to sit there and watch?

403
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,869
Who cares? We're all family.

404
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,699
That's right. It's Dad's
début commercial creation.

405
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,039
We should be congratulating him.

406
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,940
Congratulations, Dad.

407
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,140
Thank you.

408
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,240
"Creation?"

409
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,210
That's clearly my private life on display.

410
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,049
Dad. Come on. Say something.

411
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,189
Even though you're my daughter,

412
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,490
it felt wrong to keep
those stories to myself.

413
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,390
The animation company just loved it.

414
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,660
So we gave up on the project I'd
been drawing for three years...

415
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,298
and decided to work on "YoungSim."

416
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:15,899
- Come on, Dad!
- Yes?

417
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,930
You could have at least made me pretty.

418
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,200
Is my forehead that wide?

419
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,839
Is my personality really that horrible?

420
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,319
You should be proud, Young Sim.

421
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,049
You're the muse for the
cartoonist, Oh Dae Kwang.

422
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,819
Young Sim, thanks to this,

423
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,029
we have finally paid off
the mortgage on the house.

424
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,929
So we don't need to move out?

425
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,929
- That's right.
- Hooray!

426
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,170
Hooray!

427
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,999
And so, the most difficult periods...

428
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,585
of middle-schooler Oh
Young Sim's adolescence...

429
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,339
were broadcast throughout the country.

430
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,839
Dad's début work "YoungSim"...

431
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,950
exceeded everyone's expectations...

432
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,349
and recorded a high viewership.

433
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,750
Are you Young Sim?

434
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,450
Oh, so you're Young Sim.

435
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,589
Be nice to Kyung Tae, Young Sim.

436
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,029
I enjoyed the animation, Young Sim.

437
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,028
From that day forward,

438
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,440
everyone spoke as though they knew me.

439
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:30,009
They chose to like or dislike
me without really knowing me.

440
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,210
Of course, that also applied to my family.

441
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,079
You can't blame Father
for being the way he is.

442
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,078
He wants to see his darling Young Sim...

443
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,779
dating like everyone else.

444
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,190
Maybe you'll find your
match and get married.

445
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:45,160
He just wants you to live a happy life.

446
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,419
Marriage is no longer something you
do when you reach a certain age.

447
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,289
Unmarried people lead
perfectly happy lives.

448
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,960
Young Sim, just stay single
if you can afford it.

449
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,529
But you and Woo Sang are happily married.

450
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:56,730
You guys are my role models.

451
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,140
Right.

452
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:02,710
Of course, if you met
someone like Woo Sang,

453
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:06,440
that would be so great.

454
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,109
Where would I meet someone like that?

455
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,420
"Studio of Love."

456
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,019
Darling. We first met on "Studio of Love."

457
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,150
Do you remember that?

458
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,420
That's right.

459
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:23,630
I almost forgot about that.

460
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,859
I fell in love at first sight.

461
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,028
You were a really famous singer back then.

462
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,229
- That's right.
- You remember it, right?

463
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,269
Of course.

464
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:38,240
Back then, I was practically worshipped.

465
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,250
I wonder if that show is still around.

466
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,480
It was such a popular show.

467
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,249
That show hasn't been on for years.

468
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,319
So there's no hope.

469
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:53,359
Don't say that. There is some hope.

470
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,890
There's that guy at Young
Sim's work who likes her.

471
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:59,400
Remember Young Sim's birthday?

472
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:02,230
He brought over cake and chicken.
He has a puppy dog face.

473
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:03,970
I found him quite cute.

474
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,240
You mean Chae Dong?

475
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,769
We don't have that kind of relationship.

476
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,210
Young Sim.

477
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,779
Just date the guy who says he likes you.

478
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,009
That's right. Chae Dong.

479
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,279
Do you remember him back in the day?

480
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,879
He always bought custard
buns for Young Sim...

481
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,048
and followed her around like a shadow.

482
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,089
His name was Kyung Tae!

483
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,900
Darn it.

484
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,059
You're such a fool!

485
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,730
Who's Kyung Tae?

486
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,670
He's just a guy.

487
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,910
His name has become taboo
for your Aunt Young Sim.

488
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,650
This must be...

489
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,680
the curse of Wang Kyung Tae.

490
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:08,500
Of course. That's when it started.

491
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,299
Let's hang out, Young Sim.

492
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,339
I don't want to.

493
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,440
Why don't you like me?

494
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
In a word, you're boring.

495
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,549
First of all,

496
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,819
you're small and ugly.

497
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,049
But the same goes for you.

498
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,849
That's what I'm talking about!

499
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,960
You don't know anything about girls.

500
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,259
You're so immature.

501
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,829
You also don't have a driven mindset.

502
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:41,459
I don't think it's right for
people to judge others...

503
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,700
based on their height,
like you're doing now.

504
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,338
I think it's only right to
compare those who are honest...

505
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,869
and those who are not.

506
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,210
But what if someone is
tall and also honest?

507
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,539
Wouldn't they be the coolest?

508
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,849
People should only be judged
on the essence of their lives.

509
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,789
Is that so?

510
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,150
Then, climb the tree in the park.

511
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,890
The tree?

512
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,690
How?

513
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:08,890
See?

514
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,029
That's the difference between you and me.

515
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,759
Don't even think about the trees
that you're unable to climb.

516
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:18,000
If that's what you meant, I can climb it.

517
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,039
For you, I would do anything.

518
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,369
Are you sure about that?

519
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,849
I'm too high up.

520
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,549
I'm scared.

521
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,980
Please help me!

522
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,119
Can someone help me down?

523
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,259
Young Sim.

524
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,490
Young Sim?

525
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,539
Young Sim.

526
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,049
Young Sim!

527
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,650
Happy birthday, Young Sim.

528
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,019
Here you go. This is
the present you wanted.

529
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,490
I even engraved your name on it.

530
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,500
Thanks. I'll use it well.

531
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,440
(Oh Young Sim)

532
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,450
Then you will play with
me on my birthday, right?

533
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,288
Sure. Well, I guess.

534
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,819
A promise is a promise.

535
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,089
Let's meet in front of the park at 6pm.

536
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,230
Okay.

537
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,680
What is this?

538
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,529
What's taking Wang Kyung Tae so long?

539
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,690
How dare he make me wait?

540
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:28,730
He better not show up,

541
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,799
or I'll break him to pieces.

542
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,819
Kyung Tae went to the US to study English.

543
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,460
To study English?

544
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,089
When will he come back?

545
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,029
That's odd. Didn't Kyung Tae tell you?

546
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,869
We're planning to emigrate.

547
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,569
We'll join him soon in the US.

548
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,640
Emigrate?

549
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,109
Afterwards, Wang Kyung Tae
disappeared into thin air...

550
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:19,849
as if he was never here.

551
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,650
I thought I would feel good,

552
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,920
but oddly, I felt empty inside.

553
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:27,359
As if there was...

554
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,559
a big hole in my heart.

555
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:43,640
I still don't get it.

556
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:49,880
I was a bit mean to him from time to time.

557
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,778
But still. How could he just leave
without telling me anything...

558
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,690
and break our promise like that?

559
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,119
That petty punk.

560
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,130
Gosh.

561
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,819
Come on, Dad.

562
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,130
I'm sorry for being grumpy earlier.

563
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,900
Forget it.

564
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,730
Let's pretend that never happened.

565
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,869
I just want you to do
everything you want in life.

566
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,199
This time, I'm doing a dating...

567
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,240
You're dating?

568
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,039
No. I'm going to be producing a
reality dating show this time.

569
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,609
Gosh. I thought you said...

570
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,619
you were dating a man.

571
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,289
Well, I can't date in real life.

572
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:11,029
But I'll make an awesome
reality dating show.

573
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,730
I'll do my best and get recognized.

574
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,470
So you could proudly go back...

575
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,799
to drawing your successful cartoon.

576
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,210
Okay. Thank you.

577
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,660
He also wrote poems.

578
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:46,359
Wait. I saw this guy on Instagram.

579
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,099
Gosh, Young Sim. When did
you cast all these people?

580
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,338
Well, I literally used all of
my contacts and connections...

581
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:54,999
I made in this industry.

582
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,940
I begged them to star in my show.

583
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,568
I even wrote letters by hand.

584
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,609
I probably sent about 3,000
messages on social media.

585
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,549
- Did you say 3,000?
- Yes.

586
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,420
Gosh.

587
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,820
Amazing.

588
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,889
You are determined to make this a hit show.

589
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,260
I should be.

590
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,559
But this is a reality dating show.

591
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,800
It would be great if we can find
a girl with a unique profile.

592
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,030
I see.

593
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,500
(Male candidates for the
show: Lee Sam Doo, Lee Ho Jae)

594
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,940
Yes. Hey.

595
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,239
I have a friend whom we can cast.

596
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,010
- Your friend?
- Yes.

597
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,356
She runs a YouTube channel
about dating and relationships.

598
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,100
What do you think? Wouldn't she be perfect?

599
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,409
Yes.

600
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,050
Hold on. Let me call her.

601
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,449
- Okay.
- A YouTuber sounds nice.

602
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,619
("Gu Wol and Relationships")

603
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,158
("Gu Wol and Relationships")

604
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,699
("How Millennials and Zoomers Date")

605
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,739
(Oh Young Sim)

606
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,710
Hey, Young Sim. It's been a while.

607
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,780
Hey, Wol Sook. Have you been well?

608
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,250
Well, it's nothing serious.

609
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,949
I'm launching a new reality
dating show this time.

610
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,619
Do you want to be on it?

611
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,050
You want me to be on your show?

612
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,260
Yes. We'll film everything in one day.

613
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,019
Please help me out. What are friends for?

614
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,558
It will be a great chance
for you to promote...

615
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,699
your YouTube channel too.

616
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,199
But it's only for a pilot show.

617
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,530
I think that's beneath me.

618
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,239
Who will be on the show?

619
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,840
Regular people, but they'll be super hot.

620
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,110
I see. Regular people.

621
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,809
I'm not that interested,
but I'll think about it.

622
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,050
Right. Don't get your hopes up, though.

623
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,119
But you're also very... Gosh.

624
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:50,119
Come on, Gu Wol Sook.

625
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,590
She still likes to brag.

626
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,260
Will your friend do it?

627
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,098
Yes. Put her on the board for now.

628
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,219
I'll do everything I can to
get her to join our show.

629
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,730
Gosh. You're taking charge. Did
you see how she's taking charge?

630
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,210
Goodness. Okay. We're
almost done with the list.

631
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,809
Okay.

632
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,880
Then we need to cast one more guy, right?

633
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,079
Yes.

634
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:17,078
We have a personal trainer...

635
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,280
and a poet so far.

636
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,550
And the other one...

637
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,760
You know what?

638
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,888
You see a lot of young CEOs
in startups these days.

639
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:31,059
Young CEOs. What do you think about them?

640
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,030
Young Sim, if you want
someone from a startup,

641
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,429
what do you think about him?

642
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,230
What? Who is it?

643
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,738
It's called Kingvely.

644
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,900
It's a unicorn startup on the rise.

645
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:44,409
They made tons of money
by selling clothes online.

646
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,010
The CEO is in Seoul now.

647
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,279
Young Sim, if we can get him on our show,

648
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,979
our script or the result won't matter.

649
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,880
Our show will go viral in an instant.

650
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,320
And our show will be a hit.

651
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,889
But I doubt you can get him to say yes.

652
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,659
He had turned down all the
offers from other shows.

653
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,989
Don't you know who I am?

654
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:07,559
I'm known for my casting skills.

655
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,760
I'll give it a try.

656
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,949
What?

657
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,618
Gosh.

658
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,250
I thought he was the CEO of a startup.

659
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,650
But look at the revenues.
They are off the charts.

660
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,759
One, two, three, four, five,

661
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,389
six, seven, eight...

662
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,760
Wait. Billions of dollars?

663
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,800
How many zeros are there?

664
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,169
("Mark, the CEO of Kingvely,
a Mysterious Unicorn Startup")

665
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,669
("Mark, the CEO of Kingvely, Is
Known as a Korean Man in His 30s")

666
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,038
("A Korean Man in His 30s
Is the CEO of Kingvely?")

667
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,170
So no one knows who he is.

668
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,039
There's a sense of mystery too.

669
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,840
I will do whatever it takes to cast him.

670
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,920
But Kingvely?

671
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,119
Kingvely. That sounds familiar.

672
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,388
I'll be switching jobs next week.

673
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:08,889
It wouldn't be a good idea to go on air.

674
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,789
- You're changing jobs?
- Yes.

675
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,030
Ta-Da.

676
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,579
Soon Sim. Over here.

677
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,210
Soon Sim. Here.

678
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,289
Why are you calling me by that name?

679
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm Oh Ha Yoon now.

680
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,760
Besides, you look awful.

681
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,789
You're embarrassing me.

682
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,460
Gosh. I don't have time to
fight with you right now.

683
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,629
I need... Wait. Let me start with this.

684
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,598
Congratulations on
getting a job at Kingvely.

685
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,638
Thanks.

686
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,808
So I'll get to the point
and ask you a question.

687
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,808
- What is it?
- What do you know about...

688
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,179
the CEO of your company?

689
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,239
Why the sudden interest in my company?

690
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,349
And why are you curious about the CEO?

691
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,348
I'm launching a new program.

692
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,619
And I want to cast the CEO of your company.

693
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,190
Quit dreaming.

694
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,118
Young Sim. There's an old
saying that goes like this.

695
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,260
"Don't even look at a tree
if you can't climb it."

696
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,860
Even I haven't met him in person.

697
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,468
But he's in Seoul.

698
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:23,799
You must have his phone number.

699
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,038
Or you can find his number
in the company network.

700
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,699
- Young Sim.
- What?

701
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,440
Let me say this as a woman.

702
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,150
My gut tells me this will turn out badly.

703
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,050
So why don't you leave my company alone?

704
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,610
Besides,

705
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:40,780
do you honestly think
you're the right person...

706
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,859
to launch a reality dating show
when you know nothing about dating?

707
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,179
Is this why you called me down here?
I'm leaving.

708
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:50,489
What if I were to pay your
credit card bill this month?

709
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,690
What does your gut tell you about that?

710
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:56,199
What did you say? My credit card bill?

711
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Ms. Oh.

712
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,239
Where were we?

713
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,809
What did you want to know?

714
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,710
His phone number.

715
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,780
What about his email address?

716
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:15,250
(Sender Oh Young Sim, Casting
Inquiry for a TV Program)

717
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,359
(Hello. My name is Oh Young Sim.
I'm a producer at OSN.)

718
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,240
(I'm contacting you because I would
like to cast you for an upcoming...)

719
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,879
("TV Producer Oh")

720
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,509
(There was a scuffle between a
TV producer and a participant.)

721
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,070
(The producer was trying to stop
him from sexually harassing...)

722
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,840
(Inbox)

723
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,039
Stop staring at your phone.
You should just drink.

724
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,939
Seeing how Kingvely didn't
get back to you by today,

725
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,039
the answer is no.

726
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,050
For some reason, I can't seem to let it go.

727
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,348
If this doesn't work out,

728
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,920
we can invite CEOs from other startups.

729
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,920
Other startups?

730
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,719
Gosh. Right.

731
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,989
Then let's do this.

732
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,550
If he doesn't get back to me
until we leave here, I'll move on.

733
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,469
Okay. You'll move on then.

734
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:42,259
I overheard this when I went to
the secretary's office earlier.

735
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,369
Mark got an offer to be
on a reality dating show.

736
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,340
Will he really star in that show?

737
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:47,880
Never.

738
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,249
Mark treasures his privacy
as much as his life.

739
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,655
But if he does go on the show,
it will help the company a lot.

740
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,079
There's a problem with the IPO too.

741
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,230
Gosh, Young Sim.

742
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,599
You're really not going home?

743
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,098
I couldn't go home for three
days because I was helping you.

744
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,170
What is this? Look at me.

745
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,570
You should go home right
now and get some rest.

746
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,710
You're breaking my heart.

747
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,050
You don't get me.

748
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,480
What are you talking about?

749
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,388
I get you.

750
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:32,029
I know that you're working your head off.

751
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,889
I'll make it up to you.

752
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,730
It's okay.

753
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,599
Gosh, you make it sound
like I'm working a lot.

754
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,929
But how?

755
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,139
How will you make it up to me? Tell me.

756
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,170
Do you want something?

757
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,809
Tell me if you have a wish.
I'll grant you a wish.

758
00:42:58,349 --> 00:42:59,820
A wish of my choice? Really?

759
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,690
What is it? What's up with the suspense?

760
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,469
Tell me right now before I change my mind.

761
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,260
Young Sim.

762
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,760
I think you're the only one at
the station who doesn't know.

763
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,099
The truth is,

764
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,440
I, Lee Chae Dong...

765
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:25,339
- He emailed me back.
- He did?

766
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
(Mark Wang)

767
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,510
Really?

768
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:28,710
- He did.
- Really?

769
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,880
He emailed me back.

770
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,779
You brought the corporate card, right?

771
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,050
- Yes.
- You have it, right?

772
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,780
- Yes.
- Use that.

773
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,050
Gosh. No way.

774
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,860
I'd like to pay.

775
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,570
The condition is that you have to do
product placement for his company?

776
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,650
Gosh. He made it look like
he was doing you a favour.

777
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,369
Then he got a crazy deal in return.

778
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,939
I guess things will work out for me too.

779
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,816
I can't believe I got the
CEO of Kingvely on my show.

780
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,515
Don't you want to meet him in person first?

781
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:01,439
If he's handsome, that'll
be great for the show.

782
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,721
If he's ugly, our show will
still get a lot of attention.

783
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,308
I invited him to get people's attention.

784
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,880
It doesn't matter how he looks.

785
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,888
(Gu Wol Sook: I'll star in the show.)

786
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:12,049
- What? Wol Sook?
- I'll star...

787
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,518
- on your show.
- Score!

788
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,919
Hey. Mark Wang and Gu Wol Sook.

789
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,089
Everything got sorted out.

790
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,090
Hey, Wol Sook will star in my show.

791
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,400
Gu Wol Sook.

792
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,400
Young Sim. Do you still hang out with her?

793
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,769
I have a bad feeling about her.

794
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,269
Watch out.

795
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,269
She always stabs you in the
back at a critical moment.

796
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:33,539
Wol Sook.

797
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,449
That's in the past.

798
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,749
Don't you think she grew up by now?

799
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,579
We're both getting old. We
should help each other out.

800
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,289
I'm going to sleep well starting tonight.

801
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,460
What?

802
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,059
Seriously?

803
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,210
- Take this and go inside.
- Okay.

804
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,779
Let's move them together.

805
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,209
We only have four.

806
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,256
- We don't have time. Let's hurry.
- Let's move them together.

807
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,050
All right. Let's go.

808
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,090
Let's check that first.

809
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,800
(2 weeks later)

810
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,599
This way.

811
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,239
Young Sim.

812
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:36,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

813
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,710
Feel free to say hello to each other.

814
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,579
She's our main producer, Oh Young Sim.

815
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,750
She'll briefly go over the shooting plan.

816
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,879
Hello. I'm looking forward
to today's filming.

817
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,449
- Hello.
- Hello.

818
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,719
We're missing one person.

819
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:53,289
Let me check right away. Excuse me.

820
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,659
I hope we can have a good shoot today.

821
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,189
You can stay in your green room...

822
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,599
and have some drinks and
fruit until we begin.

823
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,570
When we're ready to
shoot, we'll let you know.

824
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:05,229
- Okay.
- There are some cool refreshments.

825
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,099
- Please help yourselves.
- This way.

826
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:10,340
We need to start filming.
Why isn't he here?

827
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:14,209
The last guy, Mark, has arrived just now.

828
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,980
Really? He came right on time.

829
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,780
Ask him to come in right away.

830
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,249
What's taking him so long?

831
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,610
He won't come through there.
He'll come up in the elevator.

832
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,260
I see. That's Mark?

833
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:31,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

834
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,750
Hello. I'm the CEO of Kingvely.

835
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,159
I'm Mark, Wang Kyung Tae.

836
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:18,969
Wang Kyung Tae from 20 years ago.

837
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:23,309
He's standing in front of me again.

838
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,260
(Oh! YoungSim)

839
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:39,899
One of the ladies we cast got
into a car accident on her way.

840
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,000
A car accident?

841
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:42,300
You may not be charming.

842
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,706
But you must have a special
talent and a signature move.

843
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,900
Young Sim?

844
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,098
Don't you know the cartoon?

845
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,199
Is that your name?

846
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,210
Five is a five - Gosh.

847
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:51,440
What are you good at?

848
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,340
Didn't you wear glasses
when you were a kid?

849
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,840
Why aren't you saying anything?

850
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,649
The one with the highest
score at the karaoke...

851
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,550
will get a wish in this mission.

852
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,849
People who don't treasure
other people's feelings...

853
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,889
won't know how this feels.

854
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,989
Don't you remember that, Young Sim?
