1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,850

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,620

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,450

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,680

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,340

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,910

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,160

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,300

9
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,300
Nice transition.

10
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,790
I think it'll look better to photoshop them standing at the wishing rock.

11
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,420
Where did I put it? There it is.

12
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,260
What the heck is this?

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,840
When did we film this?

14
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,730
 This is the wishing rock, huh?

15
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,170
 Making your wishes come true...

16
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,010
 My wish is for Oh Young Shim to...

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:56,350
♫  Whenever I hold your hand, it feels like flowers bloom in my heart  ♫

18
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:03,360

19
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,990

20
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,120
No, I need something cooler.

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,470
Something cool...

22
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,190
Blue...

23
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,040
Jacket!

24
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,680
This tie looks great together.

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,990
Great. This is perfect.

26
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,130
Perfect!

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,560
Shall I get going?

28
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,180

29
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,370
Who would've guessed the tteokbokki place Min Ji was talking about was my brother-in-law's place?

30
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,490
By the way... what if appearing on TV makes our tteokbokki place famous?

31
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,930
Anyhow, do you want rice cake, flour cake, or potato noodles today?

32
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,100
- I want flour cake. 
 - Flour cake, please.

33
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,460
Oh, flour cake?

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,950
What about the noodles, then? Chewy noodles, glass noodles, or ramen noodles?

35
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,380
- I want glass noodles. 
 - Glass noodles, please.

36
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,040
Looks like you two have the same taste, despite having a bad relationship.

37
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,070
All right, here's your delicious tteokbokki.

38
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,890
Whoa...

39
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,980
There's the flour tteokbokki. Enjoy.

40
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,280
- Thank you. 
 - Gosh, they look delicious.

41
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,880
Help yourselves and enjoy, all right?

42
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,930
Did I say I wanted tteokbokki?

43
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,300
Huh? O-Oh, you don't like tteokbokki?

44
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,000
In that case, shall we go eat something else? Is there anything you like?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,170
There's nothing I want to eat.

46
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,110
I just want to go home quickly.

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,850
What the heck?

48
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,940
What do you mean? What did I do?

49
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,850
You stepped on my foot just now.

50
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,300
I did? I didn't feel anything, though.

51
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,350
Oh, I just have long legs... so I can't help it.

52
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,400
Eat the tteokbokki if you have time to stare at me like that.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Let's hurry up and eat.

54
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,400
Apologize.

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,650
Hey, I said it was a mistake.

56
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,340
Can I step on you just the same, then?

57
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,380
No, you can't.

58
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,050
You absolutely can't. Those are so expensive. You can't even find them.

59
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,740
You can't get them, so you can't.

60
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,140
Apologize sincerely, then.

61
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,920
Why are you being such a petty man?

62
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,420
I quit. I'm so offended.

63
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,880
- No, no, wait! 
 - Where are you going?

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,690
Wait! Hold on one second.

65
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,340
It's because he's got such a bad personality.

66
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,040
He said he's going to apologize right now.

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
Look at him. He's going to apologize.

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,550
Come on, apologize. Apologize...

69
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,460
Sorry.

70
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,270
There you go. He apologized.

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,240
Happy now?

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,070
There, you see? He apologized right away.

73
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,550
I'll buy you good food—

74
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,040
Min Ji said she wanted to have tteokbokki with you.

75
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,100
She's sorry she couldn't eat it with you back then.

76
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,070
Oh, also, this is Min Ji's treat today.

77
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,910
Yes. So eat everything you want.

78
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,800
Should we get some fried seaweed rolls? They're your favorites.

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,030
It's fine.

80
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,370
I don't eat such childish food.

81
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,300
Say, "Ah."

82
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,640
What's wrong with you?

83
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,440
You skipped lunch again, right?

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,380
Huh?

85
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,770
It's so obvious.

86
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,210
Come on. Say, "Ah."

87
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,470
We didn't talk about doing this.

88
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,260
At least we need to look naturally affectionate like this,

89
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,970
so they don't feel awkward.

90
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,020
It's because it doesn't feel natural.

91
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,300
Isn't this what you wanted? For them to become close again?

92
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,840
Well, what are you two doing right now?

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,410
Oh, we're...

94
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,710
We were reminded of eating tteokbokki like this when we were younger,

95
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,020
so we were whispering about it.

96
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,860
Right?

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,140
That's right.

98
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,190
We're doing our best here. Aren't you guys going to do anything?

99
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,040
That's right.

100
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,740
We're going to eat. Okay?

101
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,710
We're going to eat.

102
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,510
- Ah. 
 - Ah.

103
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,900
Ah.

104
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,080
My arm hurts.

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,040
Since his arm shouldn't hurt...

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,420
It's so delicious.

107
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,760
Should we talk while eating together?

108
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,940
Come on and eat.

109
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,600
- Say, "Ah." 
 - Ah.

110
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,380
Ah.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,300
♫  We always get into a fight as soon as we run into each other  ♫

112
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,290
♫  How can love ever happen between us?  ♫

113
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,150
♫  It's unfair how I've been waiting for you  ♫

114
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,320
♫  Why are you shaking me after appearing out of nowhere?  ♫

115
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,790
No way. Did that glass noodle go in there?

116
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,010
What? Did you put it in intentionally?

117
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,010
No, no. It was supposed to be for Min Ji and Woo Chan.

118
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,080
What?

119
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:45,010
♫  The most precious memory that I cherished has become useless now  ♫

120
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,560
♫  Thinking about it, you always make fun of me  ♫

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,570
♫  It breaks my heart, and you're the only one who doesn't know  ♫

122
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:04,370
♫   The most precious memory that I cherished the most has become useless now  ♫

123
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,100
What the hell?

124
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,930
Gosh, this is an expensive shirt. Why did he do that?

125
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,840
Hey, hey, hey.

126
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you even know how much this shirt costs?

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,810
I mean, who wears such expensive clothing to a tteokbokki place?

128
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,600
It's like you're trying to impress someone.

129
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,500
That brat is... keener than I thought.

130
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,200
Yes, Min Ji.

131
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,750
 Was Wang Kyeong Tae his name? What's wrong with that guy?

132
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,500
He's not even helping me out.

133
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,520
If Woo Chan ends up being sick of me and cuts me off, will he be responsible for it?

134
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,460
I mean, he isn't a bad guy, but...

135
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,630
He is bad!

136
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,220
 Can't you tell him not to come next time?

137
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,110
I'll do better in the next course.

138
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,690
 So don't be worried today and get some sleep.

139
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,530
Okay, I understand.

140
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,570
Okay.

141
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,290
Gosh. Wang Kyeong Tae...

142
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,360
Is he helping me out or interfering?

143
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,490
Sis...

144
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,490
Yes?

145
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,350
I heard you almost had a flat noodle kiss with Kyeong Tae, huh?

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,020
Wh-What do you mean, kiss? You're wrong.

147
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,490
Things happen here and there when you're shooting a show.

148
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,830
I mean, it's not such a terrible thing. Why? Why did he have to...

149
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,930
What's wrong with her? She can't take a joke.

150
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,380
Hello? It's me.

151
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,750
Yeah.

152
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,430
What's the current situation?

153
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,390
 Yeah.

154
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,600
What's gotten into him today?

155
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,530
By chance...

156
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,630
is he trying to pull a prank again like he did on "Love Lines"?

157
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,430
This is where you come after your exams. Right?

158
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,340
Woo Chan, you can sit there.

159
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,110
- Let's get closer to him today. 
 - Okay.

160
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,610
Should we go over there and sit?

161
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,560
It's your favorite comic. This is the new volume.

162
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,160
I don't like it anymore.

163
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,860

164
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,570
"Oh! Youngsim?"

165
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,170
They've been dead silent for 30 minutes now.

166
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,940
Gosh, what a waste of time.

167
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,630
Hey, I'm leaving first. Okay?

168
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,550
 CEO Wang... is Senior next to you right now?

169
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,990
Wake up.

170
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,620
Hey, wake up.

171
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:10,410
 Why did you... suddenly disappear without a word?

172
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,820
 Senior, c-can you hear me right now?

173
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,610
 Please say something if you can hear me.

174
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,150
You're really something else, too.

175
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,270
Sleeping like a log even in this situation.

176
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,540
That's quite a skill.

177
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,680
What a funny face you have.

178
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,050
Have some of this.

179
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,420
Hey, Kang Woo Chan... aren't you being way too harsh right now?

180
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,350
Why do you ignore me?

181
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,020
Why do you act like I'm invisible when I'm in front of you?

182
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,750
And why can't I do that?

183
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,430
That's what you did to me.

184
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,390
How does it feel to be ignored?

185
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,140
Feels quite horrible, doesn't it?

186
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,220
Hey, Kang Woo Chan... that's why I apologized—

187
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,120
Hey, you ignore me when you want to... and you apologize when you want to.

188
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,730
But it's too bad.

189
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,210
I don't want to be like that with you.

190
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,220
Also... you think you'll make me like you by doing this?

191
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,370
Why did you agree to do this with me, then?

192
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,090
To make you suffer for life.

193
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:36,300
So you can watch this video... and see how selfish and mean you were.

194
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,550
So you'd remember!

195
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,840
Senior? Senior!

196
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,150
It's not the time for you to be sleeping like this!

197
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,790
Min Ji ran out in the middle of the shoot, and it's chaotic!

198
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,150
Hurry up!

199
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,370
What?

200
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,520
Hey, move out. Move! Move!

201
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,230
Hurry up.

202
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,890
Min Ji!

203
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,990
Min Ji!

204
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,580
Kim Min Ji!

205
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,930
Gosh, where did she go?

206
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,150
Where the heck did she go, seriously?

207
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,110
She's not there, either?

208
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,720
- No. 
 - I'll try going this way, then.

209
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,550
Hey, this is enough now.

210
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,700
What?

211
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,450
Why are you looking for a brat who ran out on her own?

212
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,140
How could you say that?

213
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,240
She ran out because she was hurt by what Woo Chan said.

214
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,480
It's not like what he said was wrong.

215
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,690
Why are you looking so hard for a brat

216
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,600
who ran out on her own because she failed to manipulate him as she used to?

217
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,880
Why did you become so twisted?

218
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,430
I'm only stating the facts.

219
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,630
Why did you say you'd join if you were going to be like this?

220
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,960
Why did you join if you'd be so negative and didn't see any hope of change?

221
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,840
Also, you only care about your company's image right now.

222
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,280
Right?

223
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,120
Just forget it. I won't ask for your help anymore, either.

224
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,020
 Min Ji!

225
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,450
You went and did it. Great job.

226
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,530
How does it feel? Do you feel better now?

227
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,400
There's something... you two didn't tell us. Am I right?

228
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,320
You found the teddy bear you gifted her in the trash can?

229
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
It has my voice recording...

230
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,150
 Hi, Min Ji. I hope you'll congratulate my birthday.

231
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,550
 Let's meet at Sunshine Park at 6:00.

232
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,240
I think I know how you feel.

233
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
You were like me once, right, Hyung?

234
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,820
Me?

235
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,120

236
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,080
You read this?

237
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,040
You're the Kyeong Tae who comes out in here and PD Oh is Young Shim.

238
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
They're all in the past now.

239
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,410
I'm not consoling you, but Young Shim was worse than Min Ji.

240
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,780
Young Shim humiliated me in so many ways,

241
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,950
making me buy bread for her and climb a tree.

242
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,990
Gosh, just thinking about them really...

243
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:37,070
In my opinion... Min Ji isn't too bad.

244
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,290
That's not true.

245
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,360
PD Young Shim and Min Ji are different.

246
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,600
How are they different?

247
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,560
Didn't you ever read the comics?

248
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,410

249
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,760
Min Ji! Min Ji!

250
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,890
Min Ji...

251
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,940
Are you okay?

252
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,820
It's hard on you. Right?

253
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,200
If you...

254
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,930
don't want to continue, we can end it here.

255
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,850
I think it'll be hard on me to see you get hurt by continuing.

256
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,670
I won't give up.

257
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,190
What?

258
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:57,260
Because I think I'm to blame for... making Woo Chan change like that.

259
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,150
That's why... I'm going to turn him back to his old self.

260
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,330
Then, I'm going to make him like me again.

261
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,650
I'm not giving up.

262
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,290
Okay.

263
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,930
All right. Since we had a break, shall we get started again?

264
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,850
This time, let's have a conversation instead of reading the comics.

265
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,900
Sure.

266
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,600
Kingvely's treating you all to snacks and dinner!

267
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,770
 Your delivery is here!

268
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,420
What's all this?

269
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,030
They're for you, Senior.

270
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,770
For me?

271
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,000
Surprise.

272
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,410
-  Young Shim...  
  - Yes.

273
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,520
 What do you think happiness is?

274
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,340
 Happiness?

275
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,230
 PD Lee! I think she has to vomit!

276
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,100

Hello, PD Oh. This is Yoo Ho Jae.

277
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,330

You remember me. Right?

278
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,030

I was just wondering how you were doing.

279
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,920
Ho Jae...

280
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,610
You said you were starting a new show last time. So, I came to cheer you on.

281
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,290
A surprise out of nowhere?

282
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,480
What's going on between them?

283
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,780
Amazing.

284
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,140
Young Shim... it looks like your dating life is finally going to start now.

285
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,470
A real love has bloomed in Team "Love Mark."

286
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,130
Why didn't you tell me that something was going on with the writer?

287
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,570
Gosh, nothing's going on. He said he just came to cheer us on.

288
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:53,170
Hey, who on Earth would come to see you on purpose with snacks and flowers like him?

289
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,390
What's this?

290
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,330
"My Young and Shimmied Heart?"

291
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,700
This is the title of his new poem collection. Right?

292
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,020
Gosh, it's so cringe! My gosh!

293
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,170
What's wrong?

294
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,160
Just look at the title. He's going for you.

295
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,350
This means he's totally head over heels for Young Shim.

296
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,860
Wait, Kyeong Tae!

297
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,140
They said the house repair and remodeling are all done.

298
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,940
Does that mean Kyeong Tae is finally leaving this house?

299
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm happy for you.

300
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,890
Are they already done with the construction?

301
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,680
Yes.

302
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,420
Should we start preparing for your move?

303
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,450
N-No, I'll take care of it.

304
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,910
Okay.

305
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,340
Y-You can continue.

306
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,200
Hey, Young Shim, you're meeting Ho Jae tomorrow. Right?

307
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,030
Come to Goo Wol Sook for blind dates. Let me take care of you from head to toe.

308
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,440
I'll make sure it works out.

309
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,110
Isn't it too early to call it a date?

310
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,830
What's the big deal? It's just once.

311
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,300
Did someone tell you to date him or marry him?

312
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,790
Shouldn't you meet a person to know him, just like trying on clothes before buying them?

313
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,620
Wol Sook is right on this one.

314
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,910
I mean, he could turn out to be a really great person than you thought.

315
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,240
That's right! That is the hottest restaurant with a Michelin star and a great Han River view.

316
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,370
Eat delicious food, go see a man, enjoy the views, and get healed.

317
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,330
You'd be a fool not to go out.

318
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,110
Well...

319
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,930
Should I... give it a go tomorrow?

320
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,420
Yes, totally.

321
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay.

322
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,720
 With this style, you can say your blind date is already halfway to success.

323
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,650
Ho Jae.

324
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,840
Young Shim.

325
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,630
I thought it was someone else, Young Shim.

326
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,720
Have a seat.

327
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,960
Why is the house so quiet when it's a weekend?

328
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,380
I guess everyone's busy besides you and me, Grandpa.

329
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,430
Noisy when they're here, but it feels empty when they're absent.

330
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,490
 Artist Oh, please draw me more handsome from now on, please.

331
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,940
"Draw me more handsome from now on..."

332
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,940
That's Son-in-Law Wang for me!

333
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,210
What's all this? Gosh.

334
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,100
 I think it'll look great with Wang Kyeong Tae.

335
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,170
 Could I borrow those headphones for a few days?

336
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,450
 I got them as a present, though.

337
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,680
 I'll take good care and give them back. You trust me, right?

338
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,900
 Please make sure to give them back by Christmas Eve, then. Okay?

339
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,060
 You must!

340
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,930
 What the heck?

341
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,670
 Why isn't Wang Kyeong Tae coming?

342
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,910
 How dare he make me wait?

343
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,020
 Just go ahead and show your face.

344
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,110
 Then I'll smash you.

345
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,620
Oh Young Shim really did that?

346
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,600
 You're aware promises...

347
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,660
 are included in people's feelings. Right?

348
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,960
 Wouldn't it be the same as

349
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,560
 not cherishing other people's feelings if you break promises without a word?

350
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,020
But why didn't she tell me?

351
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,920

352
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,200
It should be here somewhere if she didn't throw it out.

353
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,960
Yeah, the story was probably all made up.

354
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,770
Oh my god, you scared me!

355
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,170
What are you doing there, mister?

356
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,900
Why are you sneaking around like a thief in Aunt's room?

357
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,560
What? A thief?

358
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,840
How could you say that? It's not like that.

359
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,570
Move.

360
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,110
I might just tell my entire family what I witnessed.

361
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,750
Just who does your personality take after?

362
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,090
- Move aside. 
 - Who do you think?

363
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,910
Your excuse is quite long.

364
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,460
W-Wait, wait, wait!

365
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,120
W-Who are you going to call?

366
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,140
Well, if you tell me the truth...

367
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,540
I might let you off the hook.

368
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,380
Well... I was just... looking for a teddy bear.

369
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,000
A teddy bear?

370
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,700
There's a story behind it.

371
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,590
You're not just making things up because you're flustered, are you?

372
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,840
I wasted my breath.

373
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,850
- Forget it. I'm leaving. 
 - Wait.

374
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,660
Could it be that?

375
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,740
Are you... talking about that teddy bear with glasses?

376
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,660
You saw it?

377
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,690
 Just sell whatever Aunt Young Shim doesn't use and make some allowance money.

378
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,310
Well.

379
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,270
Yes.

380
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,400
You saw the teddy bear?

381
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,590
 I sold it to someone looking for vintage teddy bears just now.

382
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,650
 She said she lived around Sunny Park.

383
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,760
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep...

384
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,340
Why isn't she picking up?

385
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,260
What the heck...

386
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,970
Hey. Hey, young lady!

387
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,240
Wait, wait, wait.

388
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,100
Wait, wait.

389
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,380
Why won't you pick up when you're holding your phone?

390
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,250
Whoa, you really came all the way here?

391
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,750
I said no. I won't sell this.

392
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,360
Young lady... sell this back to me.

393
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,450
I'll pay you double—

394
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,360
No... triple the price.

395
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,350
Seriously, what's with you?

396
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,680
I just really need this.

397
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,530
Why does it have to be this?

398
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,030
You can buy a more expensive one.

399
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,060
I believe...

400
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,260
the past 20 years of my twisted fate will resolve with that.

401
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,550
So just sell that back to me. Okay?

402
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,430
 Yes. This is the kind of date I imagined.

403
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,120
 I shouldn't mess it up, no matter what.

404
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,650
After our Love Lines date,

405
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,860
I couldn't get you out of my head, Young Shim.

406
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,580
When I think about you...

407
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,860
I can't help but smile.

408
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,690
Oh, look at me. I smiled again, didn't I?

409
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,750
Really?

410
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,920
Thanks to you, I was even able to wrap up my poem collection I worked on for a year and published it.

411
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,400
Well, I think you were my muse.

412
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,620
 Don't say anything for now.

413
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,800
 Just laugh as hard as you can at what he says.

414
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,010
 Don't say anything weird or special. All right?

415
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,090
Is the food to your liking?

416
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,450
It's delicious.

417
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,640
That's a relief.

418
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,420
How's the new program going?

419
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,430
It's really fun.

420
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,720
Oh...

421
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,370
I see.

422
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,120
 My clothes accentuate the feminine silhouette,

423
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,610
 so all you have to do is throw your hair over your shoulder

424
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,360
 and show off your neck.

425
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,860
Young Shim, by any chance, do you feel unwell?

426
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,040
Sorry?

427
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,340
Well, you're breathing rapidly and keep touching your neck.

428
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm fine.

429
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,890
 Thank you for visiting our restaurant today.

430
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,170
 The lights on the Wishing Tree turn on every night.

431
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,980
 All customers are more than welcome to provide our employees with your wishes

432
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,150
 on our wishing papers to be hung on the Wishing Tree.

433
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,310
 We look forward to your participation.

434
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,580
Wish...

435
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,020
 This is the wishing rock, huh?

436
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,730
 My wish is for Oh Young Shim to...

437
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,860
Young Shim,

438
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,150
should we order dessert?

439
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,210
It wasn't him.

440
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,500
Ho Jae.

441
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:10,920
I don't think... this is right.

442
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,150
I'm sorry.

443
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,700
It's all right.

444
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,730
I know how to read the atmosphere.

445
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,070
There must be someone on your mind.

446
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,040
Someone you can be yourself and comfortable with is great.

447
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:56,420
And I think the Young Shim from before was much cooler.

448
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,520
Thank you for everything, Young Shim.

449
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,800
Thank you.

450
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
I'll get going.

451
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:26,250
♫  When I look at you smiling, I feel like I'm having a good dream  ♫

452
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:33,420
♫  My fluttering heart is unfamiliar  ♫

453
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,830
♫  When I look into your eyes  ♫

454
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:47,400
♫  All of my fears just fly away like dust  ♫

455
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,900
♫  I'm calling you  ♫

456
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:57,300
♫  There are many things I want to say within your name  ♫

457
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,610
What were you expecting, Oh Young Shim?

458
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,120
♫  You're looking back  ♫

459
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:19,300
♫  The sight of you looking at me tinges the whole world in white  ♫

460
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,930
Gosh, Oh Young Shim.

461
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,940
Who do you think you are to be dating? A relationship or love?

462
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,500
You messed everything up again.

463
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,180
The atmosphere was so nice.

464
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,600
Why did I have to think about Wang Kyeong Tae?

465
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,970
Wang Kyeong Tae.

466
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,580
Why are you here?

467
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,110
Did you enjoy your date?

468
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,120
Yes, of course.

469
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,720
I had a really enjoyable time on the date.

470
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,060

471
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,800
Then, why did you call me?

472
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,360
Well...

473
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,640
Well... the thing is...

474
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,970
Actually, I don't really know, either.

475
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,590
I ruined the date completely.

476
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,590
I guess I just don't have a knack for dating.

477
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,390
This is all... your fault.

478
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,610
This is...

479
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,050
Why do you have it?

480
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,660
What's wrong?

481
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,380
Let me go. I can't breathe.

482
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,060
Did something happen?

483
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,000
What's going on with you—

484
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,460
This is all your fault, too.

485
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,540
I missed you.

486
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,580
♫  Things I can't say  ♫

487
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:09,500
♫  Afraid we might become more distanced if I reach my hand out to you  ♫

488
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:24,020
♫  Because I see you going away from me  ♫

489
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,850
♫  I can't bring myself to stop you  ♫

490
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,540
 What the heck is this? When did we film this?

491
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,740
♫  ...and I can't even look away  ♫

492
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,250
♫  Because I keep missing you  ♫

493
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,620
 This is the wishing rock, huh?

494
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,200
♫  Because you're like an unforgettable dream  ♫

495
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,500
 Making your wishes come true...

496
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:01,280
♫  I want to remain by your side, even for a short moment  ♫

497
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,280
♫  Because I keep longing for you  ♫

498
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,980
 My wish is for Oh Young Shim to...

499
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,750
 have her wish granted.

500
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,410
 That's all I need.

501
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:23,310
♫  I miss you so many times, even in one day  ♫

502
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:29,360
♫  But I only stay still, unable to say a word  ♫

503
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:42,250
♫  The times we spent together were beautiful  ♫

504
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,810

505
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,480
 What about a school uniform date?

506
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,390
 School uniform?

507
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,180
 We personally went and got Manna High's school uniform. Ta-da!

508
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,450
 Tada!

509
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:02,360
 We might get a school uniform ad client at this rate.

510
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,120
 Was my life always this beautiful?

511
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,620
 Did you see this?

512
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,640
 What is it?

513
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,870
 Yes, looks like someone wrote an article about what I slipped after drinking on my live stream.

514
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:18,170
 Since things came down to this, why don't we come up with a strategy?

515
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,490
 Gosh, do we need to go that far?

516
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,810
 This is the Kingvely house, huh?

517
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:23,920
 It's so nice.

518
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,630
 Do you want something from me?

519
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,220
 Aren't you getting... an idea about what it is?

520
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,150
 There's really no time now.

521
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:36,060
 If it's for the program... I can even dance and sing in the middle of Gangnam.

522
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,780
 Are you really leaving tomorrow?

523
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,550
 Whatever, just leave! I'm free now!

524
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,380
 This is how you're going to be to the end?

525
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,350
 If you really leave like this, you'll regret it for life.

526
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,750
