00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,519
(Song Ha Yoon as the Young Sim we all know)

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,219
(Lee Dong Hae as the nerd Wang Kyung Tae)

3
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,960
(Lee Min Jae as Young Sim's
junior, Lee Chae Dong)

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,969
(Jung Woo Yeon as Gu Wol Sook)

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,070
(Ga Young as Soon Sim, and
Song Young Jae as Dae Kwang)

00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,938
(Cho Yu Ha as Ji Yu, Tony
An as Lee Woo Sang, )

00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,059
(and Wang Ji Hye as Jin Sim)

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,920
(Oh! YoungSim)

9
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,380
He came right on time.

10
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,990
Ask him to come in right away.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,489
What's taking him so long?

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,850
He won't come through there.
He'll come up in the elevator.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

14
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,719
Hello.

15
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,500
I'm the CEO of Kingvely.
I'm Mark, Wang Kyung Tae.

16
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:06,329
(Episode 2: Resentment
Stronger Than Memories)

17
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,210
Mark is the Wang Kyung Tae I know?

18
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,379
No. I'm sure they just have the same name.

19
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,479
Look how handsome he looks.

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,990
More than anything, there's no
way he's gotten that successful.

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,819
He founded Kingvely?

22
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,789
He used to be a short
kid without any charms.

23
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,259
He's the CEO of Kingvely?

24
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,569
- No way. He's so hot.
- He's so handsome.

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,099
Hello.

26
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,069
He's the Wang Kyung Tae we know, right?

27
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,579
Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,256
Did you invite our
friends for this episode?

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,919
Does he look like Wang
Kyung Tae to you too?

30
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,759
He's gotten so handsome to the point
that I can't remember his face.

31
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,989
But Wang Kyung Tae is not a common name.

32
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,360
Besides, I still see some
resemblance from his childhood.

33
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,240
The CEO of Kingvely...

34
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,169
is Wang Kyung Tae?

35
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,339
- Let's go and ask him.
- Hey, no.

36
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,780
What if he really turns out to
be the Wang Kyung Tae we know?

37
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,080
Then it will be super fun.

38
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,650
- Let's go and ask him.
- No.

39
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,120
Ms. Gu Wol Sook.

40
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,519
I have to put a microphone on you.
Please come this way.

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,990
Coming. Okay? Make sure to ask him.

42
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,159
What...

43
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,270
By any chance,

44
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,610
are you...

45
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,310
Are you...

46
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,550
I can't hear you.

47
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,979
You're Kyung Tae, right?

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,590
Yes, that is my name.

49
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,919
Do you know me, Producer Oh Young Sim?

50
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,830
Sir, why don't you sit over there?

51
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,060
Gosh.

52
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,370
What? I'm sure that's Wang Kyung Tae.

53
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,769
It has to be him.

54
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,008
- Young Sim, we have a problem.
- If he's not...

55
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,979
- We have a problem.
- What is it?

56
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,148
Remember Kim Kyu Ri, the lady who
was supposed to be on our show?

57
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,578
She got into a car
accident on her way here.

58
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,379
She's being transported to a hospital.

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,679
A car accident?

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,290
Hey! What...

61
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,149
Is she okay?

62
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,589
Yes. She did call me
herself in the ambulance.

63
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,430
- She won't be able to join us.
- Oh, no. We're in trouble.

64
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,299
- We have to start shooting now.
- What?

65
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,768
It's not like we can cast a woman
out of the blue to replace her.

66
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,169
We have some extras.

67
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,799
- Why don't you call them?
- I'll reach out to them.

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,870
I did have an ominous
feeling about the shoot.

69
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,040
- Hello.
- Hey.

70
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,169
Do you have time to waste here?

71
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,579
What brings you here?

72
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,480
I was on my way to check up on Hee Jin.

73
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,050
I came here to see if the CEO
of Kingvely really came today.

74
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,649
Goodness.

75
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,466
Hey, what are the qualifications
to be on the show?

76
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,388
Okay. So any single men and women...

77
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,518
in their 20s and 30s and in good health...

78
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,490
- can be on our show.
- Wait.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,670
Seriously? Do you think
producing a TV show is a joke?

80
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,069
Right?

81
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,540
- Me?
- No.

82
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,839
- Me?
- No.

83
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,209
Okay! Darn it.

84
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,809
I'll do it. Of course, I can pull this off.

85
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,009
I can do it too!

86
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,949
Are you sure you can do this?

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,720
You have to be single,
healthy, in your 20s or 30s,

88
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,059
and possess a lot of charms.

89
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,519
You may not have charms,

90
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,505
but you have a special
talent and a signature move.

91
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,959
Of course. You know that
I have endless charms.

92
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,129
I'll do my best!

93
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,028
It's quite hectic here. Go
and check on the status.

94
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,898
I'll go and get my makeup done.
Where's the makeup team?

95
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,439
- Makeup team!
- Hurry up.

96
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,610
Chae Dong, is everything ready?

97
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,579
- Young Sim.
- What?

98
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,409
What?

99
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,549
I bet I look weird.

100
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,648
- No.
- How do I look? Hey, take this.

101
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,649
- Everything is set up, right?
- Yes.

102
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,588
- I'm going up. Okay.
- Please go to the stage.

103
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,750
Let's start.

104
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,220
If you're ready, let's do this.

105
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,959
Is everything set up?

106
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,259
If you're ready, we'll begin.

107
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,199
Ready. Action.

108
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,699
"The Arrows of Love" is easy and simple.

109
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,398
Kingvely Corporation developed
an AI-based matchmaking program.

110
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,999
The program paired up men and
women and put the couples in order.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,579
Their dates will center
around a retro theme.

112
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,739
They're only given a day to go on dates.

113
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,208
Everyone will get a turn...

114
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,079
to go on a date with everyone
for a certain duration.

115
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,319
Then they will make their final decision.

116
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,319
Before their self-introductions,

117
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,589
let's check where they stand
based on their first impressions.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
("The Arrows of Love")

119
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,009
Right. Don't get nervous already.

120
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,639
My first impression isn't that bad.

121
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,850
(The voting result of
the first impressions)

122
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,778
We will now announce the voting results...

123
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:56,809
of their first impressions.

124
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,679

(Lee Sam Doo: 1 vote, Lee Ho Jae: 1 vote)

129
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,459
Did you all check the result?

130
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:16,398
The first date, matched by
Kingvely, will begin now.

131
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,339
(The first date will begin.)

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,115
(Sam Doo and Young Sim's date
at a tteokbokki restaurant)

133
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,279
How long does it take to
prepare for the body photoshoot?

134
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,179
Do you think I can get
the hourglass figure...

135
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,410
like models?

136
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,649
You're a producer.

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,820
You must be busy.

138
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:37,659
You should just be happy
with what you have.

139
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,929
With what I have?

140
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,460
Did he seriously say that to me?

141
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,729
So what if you're a popular
personal trainer with a killer body?

142
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,399
- Hey!
- Young Sim.

143
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,500
He's so rude and annoying.

144
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,769
No. Calm down.

145
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,210
Do I have to play that card?

146
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,120
What? Do you have something to say to me?

147
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,850
It's not that.

148
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,720
Do you know...

149
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,029
Oh Young Sim?

150
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:15,830
The cartoon character.

151
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,460
Young Sim?

152
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,070
What's that? Is that someone's name?

153
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,000
You don't know the cartoon?

154
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,440
No.

155
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,216
You haven't listened to the soundtrack?

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
No.

157
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,768
- But everyone knows.
- What?

158
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,379
One is one, not two

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,209
- Two is two, not three
- What are you doing?

160
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,678
- Three is three, not four
- Gosh. Sit down.

161
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,119
- Five is five, not six
- People are watching.

162
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,148
Sit back down.

163
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,418
You can keep singing it,
but I don't know the song.

164
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,889
- What? That can't be.
- Please sit down.

165
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,330
Listen.

166
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,758
Five is five, not six - Gosh.

167
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,469
Please sit down.

168
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,730
- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.

169
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,470
You're causing a scene here.

170
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,599
I know that I speak with an accent.

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,538
But I lived abroad for
a long time growing up.

172
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,779
So I rarely watched TV.

173
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:07,878
But this cartoon was
popular even in the US.

174
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,449
I don't know the cartoon.

175
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,720
Goodness.

176
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,019
Is the cartoon fading out?

177
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,819
Did we get enough clips?

178
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,259
(Please look happy.)

179
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,659
We didn't get any clips for the guy.

180
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,759
He has to do something.

181
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:27,200
We need more clips?

182
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,269
When will this date be over?

183
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,569
(Spicy Food Challenge for Couples)

184
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,985
(If you succeed, you can
eat for free for a month!)

185
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,039
That!

186
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,479
Look at that!

187
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,278
Let's try that out!

188
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,579
If we eat a lot of spicy
food in five minutes,

189
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,879
we can eat for free.

190
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,080
Let's try that.

191
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,049
That sounds so dumb. Why would we do that?

192
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,919
It will be fun. Let's do it.

193
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,490
You see, tteokbokki...

194
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,329
has gochujang, carbs,
flour, which is also carbs,

195
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,529
and a lot of sugar. The
calories for that will be...

196
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,199
Excuse me!

197
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,370
We'll take the Level Five challenge!

198
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,139
Gosh.

199
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:06,970
If you want to try it, go ahead.

200
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,450
How much time do we have left?

201
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,580
Your time is almost up.

202
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,519
Oh, no.

203
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,059
Can you eat one egg?

204
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,289
I'll only eat the egg whites.

205
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,559
The yolk has too much fat. Gosh.

206
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,870
It is tasty.

207
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,840
Goodness.

208
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,259
Over here! I finished!

209
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,889
You did it.

210
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,290
You're the first one to succeed
ever since we started this event.

211
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,769
You can eat everything on our
menu for free for a month.

212
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,370
I did it!

213
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:18,480
(Kyung Tae and Jung Jin's date,
a tour of the Kingvely building)

214
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,779
Mr. Wang.

215
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,210
How would you define fashion?

216
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,450
Fashion is more than just clothes.

217
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
I believe it's a weapon
that can increase our value.

218
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,059
I agree.

219
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,888
By the way,

220
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,860
how did you end up founding Kingvely?

221
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,570
A certain incident in my childhood
gave me nightmares every day.

222
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,440
So I became interested in neuroscience.

223
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,740
Naturally, I studied AI in college.

224
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,110
What was the childhood incident?

225
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,210
I can't tell you the
details of that incident.

226
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,600
But through deep learning
which I majored in college,

227
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,019
I wanted people to find...

228
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,620
the perfect outfits without wasting time.

229
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,889
I worked day and night...

230
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,960
in the early stage of my company
to build a database that covered...

231
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,659
every kind of outfit.

232
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:17,739
As my fashion AI could help
everyone, I got a big investment.

233
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,970
That's how Kingvely began.

234
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,309
I see.

235
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,540
You hired a caterer for your employees.

236
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,460
Kingvely's reputation is true.
You offer good benefits.

237
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,559
Today, we're offering big
old-fashioned pork cutlets...

238
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,320
made with antibiotic-free,
pastured black pigs...

239
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,629
that also grazed on garlic.

240
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,230
Today of all days.

241
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,580
I want to eat pork cutlets.

242
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,779
If that's what you want, I want it too.

243
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,826
(Sirloin pork cutlet, 4 dollars,
Half-half pork cutlet, 3.5 dollars)

244
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,890
The discount is only for
the half-half pork cutlet.

245
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,460
I'll take one half-half pork cutlet.

246
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,970
Here's the half-half pork cutlet.

247
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,679
I can't eat spicy food.

248
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,610
Same here.

249
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,279
You're a guy. How come
you can't eat spicy food?

250
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,239
Is there anything you're good at?

251
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,330
I can eat it.

252
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,500
I can do it.

253
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,909
Try it.

254
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,918
This big old-fashioned pork
cutlet made with black pigs...

255
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,149
is the pride of my company.

256
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,329
- Is it hard to cut it?
- Yes.

257
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,299
Then let me help you with that.

258
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:27,629
Thank you.

259
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,299
Goodness.

260
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,070
This guy. Goodness.

261
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,279
(Ho Jae and Young Sim's
date on a duck pedal boat)

262
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,309
We'll start filming.

263
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,319
Sang Eun, you checked everything. Right?

264
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,350
Yes. I did.

265
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,878
Safety is the most important.

266
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,079
- Let's focus on that.
- Okay.

267
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,190
All right. Let's start.

268
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,029
Chae Dong. Film us from afar so
you get a beautiful shot of us.

269
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,529
Gosh.

270
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,440
It's been 20 years since I got
in a duck pedal boat like this.

271
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
There are electric duck pedal boats now.

272
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,940
Same here.

273
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,908
Who knew I would be on a
boat in the Han River...

274
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:13,940
on a weekday afternoon?

275
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,750
Perhaps, this is what happiness is.

276
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,320
- Young Sim.
- Yes?

277
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,889
What do you think happiness is?

278
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,830
Pardon? "Happiness?"

279
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,500
Yes, happiness.

280
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,129
As I wrote about it in
my first short novel,

281
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,110
the topic of question I always
want to focus on is happiness.

282
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,909
You've read my novels, right?

283
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,240
Yes.

284
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,779
Gosh. Ho Jae is a writer, right?

285
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,879
I didn't read any of his books.
What do I do?

286
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,059
(Young Sim. Respond to what he said!)

287
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,860
(Now!)

288
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,200
Young Sim.

289
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,130
Yes?

290
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,970
I see. Happiness is...

291
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,039
Well...

292
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,210
Right. When you're feeling down,

293
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:19,410
you go out for a walk.

294
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,910
And you can get drunk...

295
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,980
on a sweet, strong cocktail too.

296
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,719
Looking at a poem... I mean,
looking at a picture...

297
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,789
How did you know I majored in poetry?

298
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,589
I see.

299
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,459
- By the way, Young Sim.
- Yes.

300
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,029
You don't look so good.

301
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,369
I do?

302
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,599
I never look good. That's normal.

303
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
I'm always swamped at work.

304
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,079
No. I mean, your face looks
so pale as if you're sick.

305
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,980
Is it because I haven't
felt this happy in a while?

306
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,519
I do feel a bit dizzy.

307
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,460
Goodness.

308
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,799
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

309
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,359
Are you nauseous?

310
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,140
Not at all. I'm fine.

311
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,509
Am I making you uncomfortable?

312
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,740
It's not my face, is it?

313
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,480
No, nothing like that.

314
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,920
Oh, no. What should we do?

315
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,990
I'll rush us back to the dock.
Hold on a little longer.

316
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,019
Hurry.

317
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,589
It's not moving.

318
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,829
Do you think you can hold it in?

319
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,750
What is it? What's going on?

320
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,809
Director Lee! She's about to vomit!

321
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,226
- Are you okay, Young Sim?
- I'm okay.

322
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,390
What the heck?

323
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,660
Chae Dong!

324
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,359
Help! I can't swim!

325
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,259
I'm afraid of the water!

326
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,029
Darn that Lee Chae Dong.

327
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,869
Why did you have to make
things more difficult?

328
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,009
- Hey!
- Young Sim!

329
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:33,880
Young Sim!

330
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,649
Help me, Young Sim!

331
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,019
Hey!

332
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,420
You're making a mess of everything!

333
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,650
You'll be the death of me.

334
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,859
Hey! Snap out of it, you brat!

335
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,229
- Young Sim...
- Get up!

336
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,630
Lift him up in 1, 2, 3.

337
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,528
Let me help you, Young Sim. Are you okay?

338
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,730
I'm fine.

339
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
Just a moment.

340
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,538
Oh, no! The mic! Is this still working?

341
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,508
Darn. It's worth more than my life.

342
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:08,109
- The mic isn't the issue right now.
- Dry this off for me.

343
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,209
Young Sim!

344
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,618
- You!
- Oh, dear.

345
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,349
He's not wearing a mic, is he?

346
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,689
Hey! What is that? Open this up.

347
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,149
- His in-ear monitor.
- Oh, no!

348
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,859
The in-ear monitor!

349
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,390
Darn it! Dry this off too.

350
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,430
Oh, my. I'm alive. I lived.

351
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,500
You're so good.

352
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,670
Yes!

353
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,839
I'm not sure I'll do as well as I used to.

354
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,339
Let's see.

355
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,710
You're amazing!

356
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,308
- Do you want to try it?
- Me?

357
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,029
- If you hit directly in...
- I get it now!

358
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,480
I heard you moved overseas
when you were young.

359
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,440
But you're so much better than me.

360
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,950
All games can be won with
insight and the desire to win.

361
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
By any chance, did you
wear glasses as a child?

362
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,289
Perhaps your nickname was
"Bespectacled Kyung Tae."

363
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,720
Well, on that note,

364
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,819
we've just released a new product.

365
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,259
What do you think? Do they suit me?

366
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,700
Well...

367
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,299
Let's cut here so we
can change memory cards.

368
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Okay.

369
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,369
It's you, isn't it?

370
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,210
You're the Wang Kyung
Tae that I know from...

371
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,250
Your reaction proves that you're Kyung Tae.

372
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,789
Why aren't you responding?

373
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,859
You may have become
charismatic beyond recognition.

374
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,730
But you can't fool me.

375
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,240
Why have you already come out?

376
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,269
What were you doing in there?

377
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,210
It's nothing.

378
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,519
The second dates are now complete.

379
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,689
We will now begin the intermediary vote.

380
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,859
(Sam Doo, Ho Jae, Kyung Tae)

381
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,660
(Wol Sook, Young Sim, Jung Jin)

382
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,980
Did any participants change
their minds after the dates?

383
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:59,048
(Intermediary vote results)

384
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,679
(Jung Jin: 1, Wol Sook: 1, Young Sim: 1)

385
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,220
(Sam Doo: 0, Ho Jae: 1, Kyung Tae: 2)

386
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:05,990
How interesting.

387
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,920
"The Arrows of Love."

388
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,390
The final dates will begin now.

389
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,359
This is the exercise to beat all exercises.

390
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,400
You need to lift up your chest.

391
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,140
My gosh. You're so good!

392
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,339
"State of mind."

393
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,640
"They say love is like a
sudden traffic accident."

394
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,980
- Where are we?
- Snap out of it.

395
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,849
- Young Sim?
- Yes?

396
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,789
Gosh. Are you okay?

397
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,259
I heard all about it.

398
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,818
Would you be okay?

399
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,499
We drank so much of the Han River's water.

400
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,329
We almost died today.

401
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,000
There's no other choice,
even if you aren't okay.

402
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,005
You know we need to wrap
up filming today, right?

403
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:52,199
What are we doing here anyway?
Karaoke wasn't part of the plan.

404
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,869
I will handle everything.

405
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,338
Don't you think filming
your segment here...

406
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,579
would be better than stuffing
your face with tteokbokki?

407
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,940
Do something about this.

408
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:04,048
Young Sim. There's nothing to prepare.

409
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,920
Just do as you always have done.

410
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,349
It'll all be over after this.
You'll be home soon.

411
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,348
- Dry her hair first.
- Her hair? What about my hair?

412
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,989
- Let's go.
- You've got this, Young Sim.

413
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,758
For your final date,

414
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,890
you will be competing
to reach a certain goal.

415
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,329
A competition?

416
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,459
I got the idea from the arcade date...

417
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,769
that you were on with Wol Sook.

418
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,269
You will choose a song for each other.

419
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,098
The person who gets the higher
score for their rendition...

420
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,940
will be granted a wish.

421
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,480
- What is this?
- No time to argue, Young Sim.

422
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,480
Please choose a song for the other person.

423
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,380
- Is the scoring system running?
- Yes.

424
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,730
Who should go first?

425
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,930
Ladies first.

426
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,799
Don't go regretting it.

427
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,548
("Win Win" by Bros)

428
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,159
This was sung by 17 people.
I can't do this by myself.

429
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,019
Darn you, Wang Kyung... Wang Mark!

430
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,289
Start!

431
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,528
(Win, don't stop here)

432
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,899
Don't stop here, just win

433
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,969
I've been waiting so long for this day

434
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,769
I'm just watching and waiting patiently

435
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,568
Are you running?

436
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,838
I'm flying high and watching from the sky

437
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,739
She's doing better than I expected.

438
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,140
I know, right? She's doing so well.

439
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,479
I hate losing

440
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,608
I really don't want to lose

441
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,749
Fight me, beat me

442
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,048
Why don't you try to beat me?

443
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:48,250
I'll accept all challenges,
so bring them my way

444
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,849
She's going to lose her
breath if she keeps going.

445
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,089
Just sit there and wait for
luck to find you, you loser

446
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:58,229
Don't stop here, just win

447
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,528
I've been waiting so long for this day

448
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:03,529
Sometimes, I just wait patiently

449
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,969
(Score: 89)

450
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,839
The future king of singing!

451
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:16,910
It's your turn.

452
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,420
Eight, eight, six, nine.

453
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,859
You underestimated me

454
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,529
Wouldn't you agree?

455
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,699
It was a mistake

456
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,940
Meeting you

457
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:49,750
You were never interested in love

458
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,548
You just needed someone

459
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:57,750
Who would always let you have your way

460
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,690
You needed me

461
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,000
Because I was obsessed with you

462
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,899
Put it all back

463
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,039
Take me back to the person
I was before I met you

464
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,809
You're a guy. How come
you can't eat spicy food?

465
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:17,710
Is there anything you're good at?

466
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,950
That's the difference between you and me.

467
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:25,619
Don't even think about the trees
that you're unable to climb.

468
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:38,900
Young Sim!

469
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,029
Young Sim...

470
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,768
My scars are too deep

471
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:50,169
To just call it a memory

472
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,879
This is what I wish for

473
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,909
If you ever fall in love

474
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:03,189
I hope you meet someone just like you

475
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,319
What's with him?

476
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,409
You're the superstar of this town!

477
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,608
I got 97 points.

478
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:27,609
Yes!

479
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,009
Mr. Wang.

480
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,980
Yes?

481
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:39,019
Right.

482
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:44,259
It has been a while since I sang.
It really got rid of my stress.

483
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:47,559
Congratulations.

484
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,700
Your singing took our breaths away.

485
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,869
Now you can ask Ms. Oh Young
Sim to grant you a wish.

486
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,240
Okay.

487
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,049
My wish is...

488
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,460
Did you find what you want?

489
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,869
My wish today is to get this.

490
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,670
What?

491
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,240
Headphones?

492
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,490
(Green Village Station)

493
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:50,829
Excuse me.

494
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,799
Are you talking to me?

495
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,860
Do you have something to say?

496
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,609
Can I look at those
headphones for a moment?

497
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,440
These? Why?

498
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,049
(Oh Young Sim)

499
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,720
What are you doing? Hand them back.

500
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,349
Where did you find these?

501
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,490
It's none of your business.

502
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,920
Are you kidding me?

503
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,200
This model was discontinued.

504
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,470
You can't find it anymore.

505
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,140
But...

506
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,868
A new model like this
one would be much better.

507
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,440
Doesn't it look nicer?

508
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:44,210
Someone who doesn't cherish
the feelings of others...

509
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,800
probably can't understand
where I'm coming from.

510
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,859
What is he saying?

511
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,059
Is he talking badly about me?

512
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,660
Well, does it remind you of something?

513
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
Your face says so.

514
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,339
How dare he make me wait?

515
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,309
He better not show up,

516
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,480
or I'll break him to pieces.

517
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,619
You must know...

518
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,789
that keeping promises
also show one's feelings.

519
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,859
Breaking a promise without a word...

520
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,230
means you don't cherish the
feelings of the other person.

521
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,339
It's the same thing, isn't it?

522
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,910
Go on.

523
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,950
Fine.

524
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,779
I'll buy it for you. Happy?

525
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,799
Now you can listen to music on full blast.

526
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,450
I was suddenly reminded of the past.

527
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,559
Don't you remember,

528
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,660
Young Sim?

529
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,769
What did he just say?

530
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,769
Are you recording right now?

531
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,809
Hey, Chae Dong.

532
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,910
Do they know each other?

533
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,348
- Mr. Wang.
- Yes?

534
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,019
The number two guest, the writer...

535
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,420
He said he couldn't log into the
app and asked if you could check.

536
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,190
Okay, I'll check.

537
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,660
("The Arrows of Love")

538
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,969
What is this?

539
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,809
(Ho Jae to Young Sim)

540
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,809
He picked Young Sim?

541
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,480
Young Sim, do you know him?

542
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,329
We'll start recording in
the studio in ten minutes.

543
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,200
The rules of this show are too blunt.
Right?

544
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:21,268
How can someone get
feelings after just a day?

545
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,869
This can cause controversy.

546
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,210
I know. What do you call it?

547
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,308
Let's add a consolation round.

548
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,579
We suggested it to you
during our mid-point meeting.

549
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,619
- When?
- At the meeting...

550
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,019
When? To me?

551
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,318
But you suggested that we keep it simple...

552
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,459
because there was no time.

553
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,119
I didn't say that.

554
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,028
- Young Sim.
- Yes?

555
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:44,059
You did.

556
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,229
- Please go up on stage.
- I did?

557
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,460
- Yes, you did.
- Come on.

558
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,470
Have you made your final decision?

559
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:53,569
Yes.

560
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,279
Have you heard?

561
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,309
About what?

562
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,480
That guy named Wang Kyung Tae...

563
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,349
apparently knows one of the
women named Oh Young Sim.

564
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,659
They were each other's first
love when they were young.

565
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,928
I think this whole show is fake.

566
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,189
It was made to promote
that Kingvely Corporation.

567
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,530
We were fooled.

568
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,940
Sam Doo and Ho Jae,
please come up on stage.

569
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,199
Okay.

570
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,710
It's time for the final decision
on "The Arrows of Love."

571
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,480
Which date did you enjoy the most?

572
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,719
Which direction is your
heart's arrow pointing?

573
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,730
Why is this making my heart race?

574
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,389
Why?

575
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,300
Don't you remember,

576
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,230
Young Sim?

577
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,969
No. Wake up, Oh Young Sim.

578
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,670
Don't falter now.

579
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,179
What if I don't get any votes?

580
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,339
I'll look pathetic and miserable.

581
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,610
My name will become a nickname for fools...

582
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,949
for not getting a single vote.

583
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,449
No.

584
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,719
That jerk...

585
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:23,530
But he spoke out publicly.

586
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,530
Maybe he'll pick me.

587
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:31,969
Will he? Or not?

588
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,840
Press the button for your final decision.

589
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:48,889
Wait! Hold on.

590
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,690
I... Well...

591
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,760
Why don't we say our final
words before we vote?

592
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,030
Go and see.

593
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,670
All of a sudden?

594
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,570
Yes. Usually...

595
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,768
before voting,

596
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:11,309
it's important to share inner feelings.

597
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,880
Don't you think so?

598
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:19,479
I'm not suggesting this
as one of the guests.

599
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm suggesting it as the producer.

600
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,519
What do you think? Isn't it a good idea?

601
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:28,989
Let's do that.

602
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:33,900
Fine. I'm in.

603
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,968
Okay. Then...

604
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:37,868
Since everyone agrees,

605
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:40,440
we'll have everyone say a few
words before the final selection.

606
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,268
All right, here we go again.

607
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,139
Ready. Cue.

608
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,550
It's a waste of time to dwell on it.

609
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:53,449
We're all busy people.
I'm going to be direct.

610
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,179
As for me,

611
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,619
I want to experience lovely love
with someone who has a company.

612
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,989
I thought making a decision would be easy,

613
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:06,400
but I was torn until the end.

614
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,969
There's no expiry to
your first love, right?

615
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,739
That's what I think.

616
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,639
Because people don't change so easily.

617
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,439
Why is she suddenly
talking about first love?

618
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:22,349
I believe there is a lot
of power in memories.

619
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,480
I'll be faithful to the
innocent feelings...

620
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,480
I had when I was young.

621
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,489
As you can see, I'm
beautiful and competent.

622
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,860
More than my past, I'm
faithful to the present.

623
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,929
All right, we'll now
reveal the final decisions.

624
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,880
What is she talking about?

625
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,179
What is everyone thinking?

626
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,320
Please...

627
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,059
(Select)

628
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,980
This is more entertaining than I imagined.

629
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:18,269
It really woke me up earlier.

630
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,570
It's keeping me on the edge.

631
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:23,809
Just check the result.

632
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,110
We'll now reveal the result
of the final decisions.

633
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,578
(Jung Jin, Sam Doo)

634
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,979
(Wol Sook, Ho Jae)

635
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,419
(Young Sim, Kyung Tae)

636
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,050
("The Arrows of Love")

637
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,489
Hey. Didn't Young Sim say anything to you?

638
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,129
That man is Wang Kyung Tae, right?

639
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,230
He's not just Wang Kyung Tae now.

640
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,440
He's Mark Wang of Kingvely.

641
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,400
"Mark Wang?"
- Yes.

642
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,409
Who did Young Sim pick?

643
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:00,039
I don't know. No spoilers. Concentrate.

644
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,449
Hey. I'm not nervous at all,

645
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,549
so why am I trembling?

646
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,678
- Of course, you are.
- Wait.

647
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,379
Here it comes.

648
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,518
(Sam Doo)

649
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,289
(Wol Sook)

650
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,230
It was Wol Sook whom he
enjoyed a physical date with.

651
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:25,328
Woman number one. What
is Jung Jin's decision?

652
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,299
(Jung Jin)

653
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,809
(Kyung Tae)

654
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,840
Kyung Tae is young and rich.

655
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:45,960
(Jung Jin got butterflies thanks
to the CEO's kind gesture.)

656
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,259
Man number two. What is Ho Jae's decision?

657
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,799
(Ho Jae)

658
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,599
(Jung Jin)

659
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,969
"Real love is more like
a traffic accident."

660
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,010
He enjoyed a romantic
poetry date with Jung Jin.

661
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,380
I really liked that part.

662
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:11,249
Woman number two. What
is Wol Sook's decision?

663
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,348
(Wol Sook)

664
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:16,150
(Kyung Tae)

665
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:20,590
It was Kyung Tae who showed
his competitive side.

666
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,419
That was so cool.

667
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,740
(Wol Sook puts in her all into
the competitive Kyung Tae.)

668
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,829
So far, Kyung Tae received two votes.

669
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,199
Woman number three. What
is Young Sim's decision?

670
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,670
(Young Sim)

671
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,679
(Will it be Sam Doo whom
she ate tteokbokki with?)

672
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,250
- Two is two, not three
- What are you doing?

673
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,420
Gosh.

674
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,218
(Will it be Ho Jae whom she
went to the Han River with?)

675
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,320
Me too.

676
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,059
You've read my novels, right?

677
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,199
(Or will it be Kyung Tae who
reminded her of her past?)

678
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,328
Put it all back

679
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,840
Take me back to the person
I was before I met you

680
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,079
I was suddenly reminded of the past.

681
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,340
Don't you remember,

682
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,510
Young Sim?

683
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,949
(Where will Young Sim's arrow point?)

684
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,719
(Young Sim)

685
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,630
(Ho Jae)

686
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,300
(Kyung Tae)

687
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,539
After much quarrelling,

688
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,440
she picked Kyung Tae.

689
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,908
Wang Kyung Tae received all the votes.

690
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:51,349
Where will his arrow go?

691
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,150
Here comes the last arrow.

692
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,389
(Kyung Tae)

693
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,030
(Kyung Tae)

694
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,829
(Young Sim)

695
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:16,109
What is this? Is it really me?

696
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,609
(Young Sim)

697
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,010
(Wol Sook)

698
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,409
They're a beautiful couple.
It's Gu Wol Sook.

699
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,579
(Wol Sook, Kyung Tae)

700
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,500
("The Arrows of Love")

701
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,139
How embarrassing.

702
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,840
She didn't get a single vote.

703
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,980
I knew it.

704
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,710
I doubted myself for a moment.

705
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,209
Anyway, what is Young Sim going to do?

706
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,980
She'll have to deal with the aftermath.

707
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,119
- Gosh. I'm embarrassed for her.
- Darn it.

708
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,789
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

709
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:10,429
"The Arrows of Love." We
have our final couple.

710
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,030
Congratulations, Gu Wol
Sook and Wang Kyung Tae.

711
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,969
Gosh. This scene looks familiar.

712
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,179
Wang Kyung Tae...

713
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,480
I knew it.

714
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,050
You had a plan.

715
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,360
It turned out more
entertaining than I thought.

716
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,690
(Their finale is like
a scene from a movie.)

717
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,320
(Oh! YoungSim)

718
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:42,820
I'm ruined.

719
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:46,360
We're planning a new show.

720
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,119
Do you want to be a part of it?

721
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,320
A new show?

722
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,889
Have you worked with Ms.
Oh for a long time?

723
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,630
Why are you curious about that?

724
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:56,530
It's no time to worry about this.

725
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,800
How come the show didn't get me
more new subscribers than this?

726
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:02,199
Let's try to get along, Young Sim.

727
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,670
What are you saying?

728
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,510
Hey, Oh Young Sim. We're in big trouble.

729
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,280
Okay.

730
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,389
I'll face it head-on.
