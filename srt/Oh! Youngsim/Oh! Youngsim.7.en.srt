1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,519
(Song Ha Yoon as the Young Sim we all know)

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,219
(Lee Dong Hae as the nerd Wang Kyung Tae)

3
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,960
(Lee Min Jae as Young Sim's junior, Lee Chae Dong)

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,969
(Jung Woo Yeon as Gu Wol Sook)

5
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,140
(Ga Young as Soon Sim, and Song Young Jae as Dae Kwang)

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,938
(Cho Yu Ha as Ji Yu, Tony An as Lee Woo Sang,)

7
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,979
(and Wang Ji Hye as Jin Sim)

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,920
(Oh! YoungSim)

9
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,719
They say your wish will come true if you wish for one here.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,490
- Really? - Yes.

11
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,859
If the Buddha here smiles after you make your wish,

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,299
they say it'll come true.

13
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,569
No way. I don't believe it.

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,570
It's true.

15
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:05,599
It's famous for it, so people line up on New Year's Day.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,640
- Really? - Yes.

17
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,140
Should I give it a try?

18
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,689
- There. - What did you wish for?

19
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,718
Wait.

20
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,730
Let me check if he's smiling or not.

21
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,099
It kind of looks like he is,

22
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,200
but also not.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,569
It's too dark to tell.

24
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,239
What do you think?

25
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,579
In my opinion,

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,150
he's smiling.

27
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,180
- Really? - Yes.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,950
This place must suit me well.

29
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,790
I'll ask him to grant your wish too.

30
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,189
Tell me.

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,790
- My wish? - Yes.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,030
I'll ask for it along with mine. I have a good feeling.

33
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,760
Tell me. Hurry.

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,199
Come on. Hurry up and tell me.

35
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,509
Hurry up.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,780
I like you, Young Sim.

37
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,219
What?

38
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,490
My wish is...

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,490
for you to like me back.

40
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,900
Stop joking around.

41
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:09,360
(Episode 7: Jealousy is My Strength)

42
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,310
I won't go easy on you this time.

43
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,550
Where do you think you're going?

44
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,560
You can't beat me.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,699
You'll never beat me. Understand?

46
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,500
Have mercy... I'm choking.

47
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,569
Who did this?

48
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,949
Darn it.

49
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,520
Why am I in the same place with a guy like him?

50
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,000
(A few hours ago)

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
What should I do with him?

52
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,550
I should just beat him up.

53
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,879
You little...

54
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,089
Gosh.

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,560
Darn you, Kingvely.

56
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,329
What? Did you dodge it?

57
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,500
It's so comfortable.

58
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,939
Darn you, Kyung Tae.

59
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,279
We'll start the shoot.

60
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,879
Nam Ki Ho, please come out if you're ready.

61
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,819
Yeo Ul.

62
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,689
- Hi. - You're up early.

63
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,790
Yes. Did you sleep well?

64
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,990
Yes, I did.

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,299
Don't scratch your head...

66
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,399
and open your chest.

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,939
What were you up to?

68
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,680
We normally sweep the temple grounds in the morning.

69
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,379
I see. Let's do it together.

70
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,050
- Ki Ho! - Yes?

71
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,220
Your style changed a lot.

72
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,790
Right. Yes.

73
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,790
Keep you hand down.

74
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,660
What's the matter?

75
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,529
I tried to change it up. What do you think?

76
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,100
Well...

77
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,709
It would be hard to work dressed like that.

78
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,370
You should wear something like this.

79
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,680
No, Ki Ho.

80
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,148
We worked hard on your style.

81
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,050
- No. - I'll get changed right away.

82
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,209
Okay.

83
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,819
Just let him do what he wants.

84
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,160
Why did he join this show if he wanted to do what he wanted?

85
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,459
But he's not your avatar.

86
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,410
Let's start dating in secret.

87
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,610
No one will suspect us.

88
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,180
I'll make sure to keep it a secret.

89
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,350
Okay.

90
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,660
Let's enjoy the thrilling ride.

91
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,329
Work is a sacred place.

92
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,930
How dare they try to make a memory to cherish?

93
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,739
- Ki Ho. - Yes?

94
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,409
I already swept this area.

95
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,208
- Can you sweep over there? - Okay.

96
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,410
- Over there. - Okay.

97
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,788
Gosh.

98
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,960
- No. Over there. - What?

99
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,759
You can go that way.

100
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,929
Okay.

101
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,600
Good morning!

102
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,710
What's with the air here?

103
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,980
This picture looks so gloomy.

104
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,679
Are we shooting a documentary or a variety show?

105
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,648
That's not the issue.

106
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,990
They haven't talked for ten minutes. They're only sweeping.

107
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,820
Who agreed to do this?

108
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,629
Yeo Ul wanted to do it, so I agreed.

109
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,429
What's next on the agenda?

110
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,699
Meditation.

111
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,730
Goodness.

112
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,269
Are you joking?

113
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,009
"Joking?" Do I look like I'm joking?

114
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,939
Watch what you say.

115
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,539
- Young Sim. - Calm down, it's no time for this.

116
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,179
Give me the agenda.

117
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,980
What is this?

118
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,190
Are you out of your mind, Young Sim?

119
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,720
This is not a Buddhist show, is it?

120
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,929
It turned out this way because it was what Yeo Ul wanted.

121
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,700
Darn it. This won't work.

122
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,639
Does it look like I'm joking?

123
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,580
Why would I come here to do that?

124
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,809
Gosh. He makes me so angry.

125
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,619
Why did he become so mean?

126
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,220
- Young Sim. - Yes, Wol Sook.

127
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,889
Did something happen between you and Kyung Tae while I was gone?

128
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,559
No, of course not.

129
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:28,029
He wouldn't act like that for no reason.

130
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,469
I thought he was becoming a nicer person these days,

131
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,570
but he has become the grumpiest guy overnight.

132
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,340
He's charming because he's a bad guy.

133
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,149
He's not bad. He's evil.

134
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,079
He's always picking fights and getting mad.

135
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,389
I really can't understand him. It really bothers me.

136
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,360
Does he bother you? Why?

137
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,289
Kyung Tae is always like this.

138
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,789
Well...

139
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,399
There are a lot of people around,

140
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,899
but he keeps on getting angry and picking fights.

141
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,139
That's why.

142
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,309
Is that why?

143
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,849
I'll keep my eyes on Kyung Tae now.

144
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,279
You don't have to worry about him.

145
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,950
What?

146
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,990
I'm trying to get together with Kyung Tae.

147
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,189
I tried to get close to him during the workshop,

148
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,590
but things didn't really fall into place.

149
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,460
Can you help me out?

150
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,990
Why should I?

151
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,029
Do you like Kyung Tae?

152
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,870
Hello.

153
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm the CEO of Kingvely. I'm Mark, Wang Kyung Tae.

154
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,600
What?

155
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,370
What are you talking about?

156
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,809
You're talking nonsense.

157
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,879
Why would I like Kyung Tae?

158
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,509
Don't joke like that.

159
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,950
That's impossible. It's not like that.

160
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,379
If you hate him so,

161
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,190
I'm glad.

162
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,418
You don't have to help me out.

163
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,360
Just don't get in my way, okay?

164
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,360
That's what friends are for, right?

165
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,000
Sure...

166
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,269
We're ready for yoga time.

167
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,268
Okay! Coming!

168
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,639
- Let's go. It's yoga time. - Okay.

169
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,479
Can you shoot from this angle?

170
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,779
Can you unroll the mats?

171
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,080
I need to check if the logo came out well.

172
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,548
Yes. It looks good.

173
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,288
- Ms. Oh. - Yes, Mr. Wang.

174
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,649
- Is everything ready? - Yes.

175
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,519
I took our company products and printed our logo on it.

176
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,490
Good.

177
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,000
By the way, how did you think of this?

178
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,629
Because I knew there would be a yoga class during their stay.

179
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,309
(Yoga Course)

180
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,308
This is the only time they'll be able to get intimate...

181
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,350
at the temple.

182
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,419
- Wait. - Sure.

183
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,779
Let me see.

184
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,649
A bit this way.

185
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,119
Take close-up shots whenever you get a chance.

186
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,758
No matter the angle,

187
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,230
Kingvely's logo needs to be visible.

188
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,100
Here. Zoom in.

189
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,029
Also,

190
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,899
tell them not to cover the logo when they're doing yoga.

191
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,340
What?

192
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,370
Okay, sure.

193
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,549
The first pose is the triangle pose.

194
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,049
Stand shoulder width apart.

195
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,320
Extend your arms to your sides.

196
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,250
We'll start with our left side.

197
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,389
Look up toward the tip of your left hand's fingers.

198
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,860
Look at the tip.

199
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,539
This is the second pose. It's called the eagle pose.

200
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,069
Take your right arm and go like this.

201
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,710
Push into the palms.

202
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,240
Take your right leg and wrap it around.

203
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,909
Like so, and hold the pose.

204
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,059
Gosh.

205
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,730
Move out of my way.

206
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,840
What are you up to again this time?

207
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,240
Sorry.

208
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,769
Your heart must be full of agony.

209
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,840
Concentrate on the mind.

210
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,480
Why do I have to do this?

211
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,789
Now, partner up.

212
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,789
The next pose is for couples.

213
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,669
Okay. I will partner with Yeo Ul.

214
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,740
I should partner with Kyung Tae.

215
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,909
- I'll... - Then I'll go...

216
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:38,639
with Wol Sook.

217
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,250
Me? With me? Why?

218
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,149
I want to get to know you better.

219
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,549
But I want to partner with Kyung Tae.

220
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,690
- Just do it with me. - What?

221
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,659
Gosh.

222
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,339
They want to keep their relationship a secret, is that it?

223
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,539
Then...

224
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,710
the two of you can be a team.

225
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,210
Okay...

226
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
The first pose for couples is the bat pose.

227
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,860
Spread out your legs and sit down.

228
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,558
The women who are standing...

229
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,200
will gently push down the backs of the men.

230
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,840
Ki Ho, do you have perfume on?

231
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,080
If you can't wear the outfits,

232
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,649
wear this instead. Can you do that much?

233
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,679
Yes, sure.

234
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,820
Okay.

235
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,230
Make sure you say this.

236
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,860
Repeat after me.

237
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,029
This new perfume from Kingvely...

238
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,470
"This new perfume from Kingvely..."

239
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,929
was made in partnership...

240
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,869
"This new perfume from Kingvely was made in partnership..."

241
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,710
with a French perfumery...

242
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,068
"with a French perfumery..."

243
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,079
- that has a long history. - "that has a long history."

244
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,779
- This new perfume for men... - "This new perfume for men..."

245
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,619
can allow you to feel the emerald-coloured ocean...

246
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,829
of the Mediterranean and the fragrance of fruits.

247
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,359
Become a member now...

248

249
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,669
Perfect.

250
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,769
King Ocean Pour Hommes...

251
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,700
will give you a lasting scent...

252
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,410
that turns you into a charming man.

253
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,309
Please focus on the yoga pose.

254
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,750
This is the bat pose.

255
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,779
Breathe in. As you breathe out,

256
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,190
lower your stomach, chest, and your chin.

257
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,490
Try to get as low as possible.

258
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,889
Now, breathe out.

259
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,989
Stop. I think my legs will rip.

260
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,400
- You can do this, Ki Ho. Look. - No...

261
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,960
He's doing so well.

262
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,369
You're good at this.

263
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,000
Breathe out.

264
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,170
Do it properly.

265
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,109
Do it properly.

266
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,349
Stop talking to me.

267
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,920
Is this the best you can do?

268
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,490
Abnormal pulse. Caution.

269
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,720
Your heart rate is rising.

270
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,890
You're aroused.

271
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,189
Please calm down.

272
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,230
"You're aroused?"

273
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,200
No. It's not like that.

274
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,640
I detect multiple abnormal pulses.

275
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,809
Be quiet.

276
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,838
- Hey. - That hurts.

277
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,538
Ki Ho, are you okay?

278
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,509
- Is it this leg? I'm sorry. - That hurts!

279
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,750
Are you okay? What do I do?

280
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,450
Gosh. Are you okay?

281
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,430
I hope I didn't disappoint her for making a fuss.

282
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,960
She can only be disappointed if she liked you.

283
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,099
This is no time to be concerned about that.

284
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,039
Can't Kyung Tae talk nicer?

285
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,980
It's your fault for choosing yoga.

286
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,278
She's right.

287
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,910
Your heart also raced earlier, didn't it?

288
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,450
Do you have a chronic illness or something?

289
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,299
Or was it because yoga gave you good blood circulation?

290
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,640
It's broken, that's why.

291
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,839
Why blame the watch?

292
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,279
It's none of your business.

293
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,019
What we have to worry about is the next step.

294
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:14,750
I knew it.

295
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,289
There was no chance.

296
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,390
I agree.

297
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,230
After watching for a while,

298
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,899
I'm sure Yeo Ul doesn't think...

299
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,430
of Ki Ho more than a colleague.

300
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,569
What should we do?

301
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,039
There's one way.

302
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,279
We'll make her jealous.

303
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,348
Your phone is ringing.

304
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,789
(Jenny)

305
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,289
It's Jenny.

306
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,190
Why is she suddenly calling?

307
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Hello?

308
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,470
It's me, Jenny.

309
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,940
What are you doing?

310
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,670
I'm eating right now.

311
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:11,809
Did you eat?

312
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,818
I'll ask you to take me out for a drink.

313
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,950
Act like it's a possibility before hanging up.

314
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,359
Yes, ma'am. I mean, sure.

315
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,529
Hey, can you take me out for a drink tonight?

316
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,559
Do you want to drink tonight?

317
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:37,829
I'm a little busy right now.

318
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,200
Yes.

319
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,210
I'll call you back later, then.

320
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,279
Okay. Bye.

321
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,890
Who was that?

322
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,750
That?

323
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,859
She's a friend I know from a group.

324
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,059
She keeps on calling me.

325
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,759
I see.

326
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,839
I'm finished. I'm going to the bathroom.

327
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,309
No. It's a man...

328
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:26,078
I wonder if it's okay.

329
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,680
I hope I didn't offend her.

330
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,059
That will be a good sign. That means she's jealous.

331
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,390
Out of all the reaction she showed us so far,

332
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,130
that was the most meaningful one.

333
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,460
Then does it mean it really worked?

334
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,670
Be quiet. She's coming.

335
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,839
- Ki Ho. - Yes.

336
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,309
Do you want to go to the wishing rock with me later?

337
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,539
Sounds good.

338
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:56,480
I want to talk to him privately.

339
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,549
Sure. That's fine. You guys can talk in private.

340
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,380
Then see you later.

341
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,950
Okay.

342
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,230
Gosh. Oh, my.

343
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,670
It must have worked.

344
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,740
Right. It must have worked. Good luck, Ki Ho.

345
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Okay.

346
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,349
Ki Ho.

347
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,150
We can go up that way.

348
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,750
Everyone except for one cameraman should pull out now.

349
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,599
Gosh.

350
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:54,940
They look great together.

351
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,640
Don't you think this will a beautiful scene?

352
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,019
Is he close with Ms. Oh Young Sim?

353
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,190
Close?

354
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,130
They're probably closer than you think.

355
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,630
We became a team only a year ago,

356
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,500
but I fell in love with her.

357
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,569
Chae Dong, throw him down!

358
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,839
I'm almost done here, Young Sim.

359
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,298
(Jang Hwan: It's been 1 day since we became a couple.)

360
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:33,299
(We're officially dating starting today.)

361
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,079
You think you'll be happy, right?

362
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,990
Why am I in an awful mood?

363
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,029
Mr. Wang.

364
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,230
What are you doing here alone?

365
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,429
They asked for you because something important is...

366
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,430
about to happen.

367
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm good.

368
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,500
What?

369
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,269
We have to put in one more of our products at this critical time.

370
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,740
We have so much to do.

371
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,210
I said I was good.

372
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,650
You were so passionate about this a moment ago.

373
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:17,849
Why did you suddenly change?

374
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:20,980
It's not fun anymore.

375
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,289
I'm heading back to Seoul now.

376
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,190
Ms. Oh. No.

377
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,289
Soon Sim, wrap up here and come back to Seoul too.

378
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,759
It looks like they don't need our help here.

379
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,470
Bye.

380
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:40,700
What's up with him?

381
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,079
It's that way.

382
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:52,579
- Okay. - Okay.

383
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,890
When you make a wish here,

384
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,299
at least one wish comes true. So it's called the wishing rock.

385
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,538
Once you arrive at the wishing rock,

386
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,779
try to tell her how you feel at the right moment.

387
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,710
Then you'll have a higher chance of making this work.

388
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,180
Really?

389
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:28,589
The fact that you'll go there with just the two of you...

390
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,589
means she's opening up to you.

391
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,358
Once you make it to the wishing rock,

392
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,730
you have a good chance of becoming a couple.

393
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,990
Really?

394
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,758
That rock... It must be...

395
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,470
the name, the wishing rock. That must be why, right?

396
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,200
Good luck. You might end up getting a hug from her too.

397
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,069
A hug?

398
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,579
Gosh. When I tell her how I feel,

399
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,849
should I try to sound manly or romantic?

400
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,420
Be yourself. Just follow your heart.

401
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,779
Then you'll be fine.

402
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,960
(Offering Box)

403
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,529
Well, Yeo Ul.

404
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,559
I have something to say to you.

405
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,900
Of course, I'm sure you probably figured out what I'm about to say.

406
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,410
I'm getting the butterflies for him.

407
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,209
Let's get ready for a touching scene.

408
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,079
We can't miss anything. We should get every second of it.

409
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,109
I also have something to tell you.

410
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,650
Can I go first?

411
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,250
Okay. Sure.

412
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,130
It would be a lie that...

413
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,759
I didn't know how you felt about me.

414
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,200
After all, we're filming a TV show.

415
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,440
I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable.

416
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,479
I was uncomfortable,

417
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,009
but it was a good kind of discomfort.

418
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,278
Seeing you getting shy around me because you like me...

419
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,049
gives me a new sense of confidence.

420
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:11,490
So I think it's a good thing to like someone.

421
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,339
Yeo Ul.

422
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:29,009
- Will you... - But did you know this, Ki Ho?

423
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,009
Our struggles comes...

424
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:35,950
from our feelings of liking and hating someone.

425
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,549
The pain of love comes from our feelings of liking someone.

426
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,890
Right. That's true.

427
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:47,289
And isn't life all about overcoming such pain...

428
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,329
and heartaches?

429
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,200
I've given it a lot of thought for a while.

430
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,869
And I've made up my mind.

431
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,769
To let go of love and hatred...

432
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,079
and set out alone like the horn of a rhino.

433
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,809
Something is off about her speech.

434
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,109
We should...

435
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,349
let her finish.

436
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,089
Wait. Set out where?

437
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,849
Alone?

438
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,359
Can I go with you?

439
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,160
No. I must walk this path alone.

440
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,599
It's the path of asceticism.

441
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,799
Asceticism?

442
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,470
Wait. Is this supposed to have a crazy ending?

443
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,240
Darn it. No.

444
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:41,009
What do you normally do?

445
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,579
Should I join you?

446
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,049
That might be a little difficult.

447
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,180
Why is that?

448
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,789
I'm going to bow 3,000 times to Buddha as my workout.

449
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,389
That can't be.

450
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,359
Darn it. No, Yeo Ul!

451
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,859
That's right.

452
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:58,529
I'm leaving for Tibet soon.

453
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,470
To find myself.

454
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:11,809
I see.

455
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,509
Then why did you agree to be on this show?

456
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:20,950
I wanted to make a good memory with you one last time.

457
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,490
I'm selfish, aren't I?

458
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,190
Yes.

459
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,359
You're so selfish.

460
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,660
I can do...

461
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,869
everything for you, Yeo Ul.

462
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,869
Don't change yourself for other people.

463
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:45,140
I liked the old you much more than the new you here.

464
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,910
What does that matter now?

465
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,910
What happened just now is simple.

466
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,849
I failed.

467
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,559
Yeo Ul, you're so cruel.

468
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,509
Don't get in my way.

469
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,940
You'd find a way to go around me even if I was in your way.

470
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,380
I also have something to tell you.

471
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,519
I'm leaving for Tibet soon.

472
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,890
To find myself.

473
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,690
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.

474
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,059
This is why she agreed to be on our show?

475
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,469
I had no idea. Seriously.

476
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,399
What am I going to do? This is really bad.

477
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,269
I'm so stupid. I was so clueless.

478
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,179
Does he have eyes up here?

479
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,980
- How did he know? - Is the shoot going well?

480
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:32,680
I'm looking forward to it.

481
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,949
Make sure to show me the edited footage not too late.

482
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,750
I'm in big trouble now.

483
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,259
Why did she have to say that to him now?

484
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,730
Maybe, I should have listened to Wang Kyung Tae.

485
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,969
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

486
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,369
It's too late to find replacements.

487
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,710
No.

488
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:58,910
I should focus on the truth.

489
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,809
I can't lie to the viewers.

490
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,180
If I show the truth to people,

491
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,009
I'm sure the viewers will like that.

492
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,219
I should try to edit that again.

493
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,889
Ki Ho?

494
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,929
Ki Ho. Are you all right?

495
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:27,900
Can you edit out everything that happened today?

496
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:32,578
Well, actually, I was thinking about what to do.

497
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,510
Don't think about it. Just delete everything.

498
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,919
This is worse than just hitting on a random girl...

499
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,980
on a street and getting slapped.

500
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,590
It's more humiliating than that. You saw it too.

501
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,030
Ki Ho.

502
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:55,159
I truly understand what you're going through.

503
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,369
My feelings were completely disregarded.

504
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:04,440
Yet, you want to air those clips on TV?

505
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,610
Ki Ho. But...

506
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,050
this is more than just a TV show.

507
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,949
I think this is Yeo Ul's answer to your feelings.

508
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:21,460
Everything we recorded today...

509
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:25,190
is her story as much as it is yours, Ki Ho.

510
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:28,360
I don't think I'll ever be able to find love...

511
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,500
because of what happened today!

512
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,039
But...

513
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,569
you want to record this day with videos that will last forever?

514
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,610
No! I can't let that happen.

515
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,679
I understand. You should...

516
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,578
try to calm down right now.

517
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:46,679
- Delete that. - I...

518
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,519
Ki Ho, have you forgotten?

519
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,760
We talked about never giving up...

520
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,190
no matter whatever obstacles came your way.

521
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,730
Do you think you could say the same thing if you were in my shoes?

522
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,109
No, Ki Ho! You can't do that. What are you doing?

523
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,610
- Give it back! No! You can't! - Producer Oh.

524
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,079
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

525
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,150
- Tell them I did it. Okay? - No.

526
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,380
No, Ki Ho! You can't do that!

527
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,049
Ki Ho! No!

528
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,888
Ki Ho! Hold on.

529
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,759
Ki Ho.

530
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,729
Ki Ho, open the door. You can't do this.

531
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,530
Please be reasonable.

532
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,929
Ki Ho. Give me another chance at editing them. Please.

533
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,670
Once time passes by,

534
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,599
you'll forget about this and move on.

535
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,210
I'll take care of this.

536
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,578
No!

537
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,479
Don't do it, Ki Ho!

538
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,609
Ki Ho!

539
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,019
Ki Ho, wait!

540
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,650
I'm not in the mood to do this with you right now.

541
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,260
I should be saying that to you.

542
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,730
Did you just push me?

543
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,469
Yes. I did. So what?

544
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,679
I was just asking. Maybe, I'll push you too.

545
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,780
This turned out great.

546
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,750
I was in an awful mood, anyway.

547
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,690
I won't just stay down.

548
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:40,759
- You... - You coward!

549
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,969
What? You're the coward, you jerk!

550
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,599
Just stop meddling with my life.

551
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,968
Why are you getting in my way when you have everything?

552
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,639
What nonsense is that?

553
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,539
Nothing is going well because of you!

554
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,480
Life isn't fair.

555
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,550
Must you have everything to yourself?

556
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,619
You little...

557
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,019
How dare you?

558
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:05,420
- You... - What are you doing?

559
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,059
I'm sick of seeing your face.

560
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,559
Have you gone mad?

561
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,360
Yes. So please leave us alone!

562
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,229
You must not know that I'm a master of revenge.

563
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,699
I was going to leave quietly.

564
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,598
But you started this.

565
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,000
Don't regret it.

566
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,170
You jerk.

567
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:29,980
I bet this is killing you.

568
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,280
That's ticklish! I said it tickled!

569
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,149
- Mr. Wang. - Let go of me. Stop that.

570
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,219
- Hey. That really hurts. - What? Why are they fighting?

571
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,260
Kyung Tae. Chae Dong!

572
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,559
We have a big problem. This isn't the time to fight!

573
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,630
What big problem?

574
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,198
Young Sim was abducted.

575
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,199
- Abducted? - How is that possible?

576
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:56,309
That ridiculous incident happened to Young Sim.

577
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,538
Ki Ho...

578
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,780
abducted my sister and disappeared!

579
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:04,379
- Where's everyone? - Down there.

580
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,650
Hurry up!

581
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,550
- I need to go first. - What are you doing?

582
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,449
- How dare you? - Hurry!

583
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,039
Gosh. Where are we?

584
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,840
(I'm with Ki Ho, but...)

585
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,079
What? Darn it.

586
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,719
My phone just died.

587
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,349
Oh, no. I'm in trouble.

588
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,329
What's going on?

589
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,189
Ki Ho got all worked up.

590
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,759
So he took the footage Young Sim was editing and ran away.

591
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,828
- What? - Oh, my.

592
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:57,170
The first episode is around the corner.

593
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,669
But here's the problem.

594
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,739
Young Sim was abducted along with the footage.

595
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
- What? - What?

596
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:06,109
Then shouldn't we call the police?

597
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,409
- Call the police. - Hold on. I'll call them.

598
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,079
No police.

599
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,679
What's going on?

600
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,380
We haven't heard from her, right?

601
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,848
Then we should call the police right now.

602
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,260
I said no!

603
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,920
Why not?

604
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,159
You.

605
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:29,530
This is the last chance I can give you, Young Sim.

606
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,030
Yes, sir.

607
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,210
Anything could happen to her if we don't act fast.

608
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,209
If we call the police, there will be news articles...

609
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,480
even before the program launches.

610
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,710
Don't you know how important this program is to Young Sim?

611
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,280
Gosh. This is crazy.

612
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:51,789
If there's another scandal,

613
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,719
she will lose her chance for good.

614
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:57,960
We must be careful.

615
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,840
Then we should reach out to Ki Ho or his family.

616
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,139
Shouldn't we try to negotiate or persuade him?

617
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:11,070
No. Given his character,

618
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:13,909
that could corner him into extreme circumstances.

619
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,679
Then is doing nothing your plan?

620
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,190
We can't reach her?

621
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,019
She sent us a text ten minutes ago with a lot of typos.

622
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:31,989
After that, her phone is turned off.

623
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
Oh, no.

624
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:38,599
Did something awful happen to my sister?

625
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,570
Hey, not you too.

626
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,070
I'm sure she's fine.

627
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,320
An increase in your heart rate has been detected.

628
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,059
Was Young Sim...

629
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,059
wearing the smartwatch?

630
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,530
The watch?

631
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,929
Yes. I saw that.

632
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,670
She's wearing my watch?

633
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:16,909
This watch...

634
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,179
I think he's just blaming the watch.

635
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:28,550
It's working. It looks nice.

636
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:34,260
If this is an emergency, ask for help.

637
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,820
Mr. Wang.

638
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,429
This only goes off during an emergency.

639
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,599
What do we do?

640
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,440
Did something really happen to my sister?

641
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,949
No. Gosh. What's going on?

642
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,929
Young Sim.

643
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,159
Where are you right now?

644
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,630
(Oh! YoungSim)

645
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,138
- Ki Ho. Stop the car. - Come on.

646
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:54,968
You're getting farther away. What are you doing?

647
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:56,169
Come on. Step on it!

648
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,408
- Wait. - Let go of me!

649
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,480
- Young Sim! - Young Sim!

650
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Wake up.

651
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,239
Kyung Tae.

652
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,280
I know you better.

653
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,780
I know how you feel better than anyone.

654
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,949
- What do I do? - Oh, no.

655
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:11,789
I know how you feel too.

656
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:16,929
- Kyung Tae! I'm so relieved! - Gosh.

657
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:18,559
I will continue...

658
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:20,960
to like you and follow you as your junior.

659
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:22,769
Thank you, Chae Dong.

660
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,399
Just sell off anything Young Sim doesn't use...

661
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,469
for some allowance.

662
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,340
Nothing's wrong, right?

663
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,079
We live in the same neighbourhood. He's always following around.

664
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,550
You have big dreams.

665
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,280
She doesn't want to date him,

666
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,619
but she doesn't want other girls to date him.

667
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,518
I think something like this...

668
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:44,920
could happen at least once to young kids like them.

669
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:47,789
That never happened to me.
