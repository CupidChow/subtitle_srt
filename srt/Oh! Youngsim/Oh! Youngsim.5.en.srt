(Song Ha Yoon as the Young Sim we all know)

(Lee Dong Hae as the nerd Wang Kyung Tae)

(Jung Woo Yeon as Gu Wol Sook)

(Cho Yu Ha as Ji Yu, Tony An as Lee Woo Sang, )

(and Wang Ji Hye as Jin Sim)

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,920
(Oh! YoungSim)

9
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,969
Did everyone go out?

10
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,370
Gosh, it's hot.

11
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,988
Darn it. It hurts my pride,

12
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,989
but I'm the one who needs him.

13
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,319
I can go even further than this.

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,329
One needs to win over love.

15
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,329
What? Chae Dong, what are you doing here?

16
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,040
Hello. What about you?

17
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,909
I have to call dibs on something.

18
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,279
By the way,

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,239
why are you visiting a colleague at a time like this?

20
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:50,349
I also have something to pass to Young Sim, so I'm dropping by.

21
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,090
What is it? I'll pass it on to her.

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
Could it be...

23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,519
love?

24
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,859
You'll wake everyone up.

25
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,530
You're a producer, right?

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,569
Producer.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,568
Did you know that your eyes...

28
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,139
and mine are very similar right now?

29
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,680
In my opinion,

30
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:23,009
we want the same thing.

31
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:26,750
Shall we...

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,288
become partners?

33
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,889
I think I can help you a lot.

34
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,659
Gosh.

35
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,590
What are you doing?

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,930
Why are you scared?

37
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,599
What are you doing?

38
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:53,210
(Episode 5: Excitement Alarm)

39
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,949
Flushed face.

40
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,250
Loose...

41
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,259
clothes?

42
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,159
On top of that, they were alone in the house.

43
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,099
Her eyes are shaking.

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,870
Breathing heavily.

45
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,969
Also, why is her hair wet?

46
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,479
Don't you want something to drink?

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,949
It's really hot today.

48
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,819
It's hot enough to melt ice.

49
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,520
Young Sim, what is it?

50
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,460
I thought there was a bug.

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,270
Something happened, didn't it?

52
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,509
You can't fool me.

53
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,469
I'm busy, so I'll get going.

54
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,639
We didn't even get to the core. Where are you going?

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,219
What happened?

56
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,650
We heard screams.

57
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,819
Did something happen?

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,839
Hey! Get away from me!

59
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,739
Get your hands off me.

60
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,239
Turn away.

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,169
I'd be up by now if I were you.

62
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,378
Hurry up. Turn your head and close your eyes.

63
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,879
Gosh. I know there's nothing to see.

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,050
What? Did you see it?

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,680
You did, didn't you?

66
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,419
- Did you see it? - No, I didn't.

67
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,490
- Hey! - Young Sim, are you upstairs?

68
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,329
What?

69
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,300
Young Sim, I'm here. Can I go up?

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,698
Hey, that's mine.

71
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,970
Why did she take my clothing?

72
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,769
Pink?

73
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,639
Okay! I'm coming.

74
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,379
- Gosh. - Be careful.

75
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,920
Young Sim.

76
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,560
There is only one bathroom in this house.

77
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,689
We were fighting over it when you came.

78
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,759
Right?

79
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,860
Yes. That's right.

80
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,740
But the screams sounded like...

81
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,879
you saw something you shouldn't have.

82
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,509
Wol Sook is so sharp.

83
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,920
Am I wrong?

84
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,250
Yes. What scream?

85
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,889
Young Sim, don't get caught up in it.

86
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,730
By the way, why are you two here at this hour?

87
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,699
Me? I came to cast Kyung Tae.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,329
Me?

89
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,339
What? But he's going to do a show with me.

90
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,139
What are you talking about? What show?

91
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,810
The two of you? Together?

92
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,948
When? Why didn't you tell me?

93
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,949
Chae Dong, is this true?

94
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,449
Yes. What?

95
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,490
What show is this?

96
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,649
Well...

97
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,720
It's a dating show.

98
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,560
Them two...

99
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,600
You are so disloyal.

100
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,069
"Disloyal?"

101
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,170
It's just work.

102
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,680
What is this?

103
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,180
Why is my heart racing?

104
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,990
That sounds like fun. I'll join.

105
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,329
Who says you can?

106
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,029
The show went viral, and you got another show to do.

107
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,899
I'm partly to thank for that.

108
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,500
No. I wouldn't say partly.

109
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,509
I was crucial.

110
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,139
It couldn't have been possible without me.

111
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,750
Is backstabbing considered crucial?

112
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,850
What is she saying?

113
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,089
It's not called backstabbing. It's called suspenseful.

114
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,958
No wonder all your previous shows were so boring...

115
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,160
and couldn't date, either.

116
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,528
What? Gu Wol Sook!

117
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,129
You're impossible to talk to. What do you say, Kyung Tae?

118
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,670
- Well, I... - It'll be helpful to you too.

119
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,939
You're a businessman. You must have a good hunch.

120
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,670
And of course, you're okay with it, right?

121
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,279
Chae Dong, tell her to stop talking nonsense.

122
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,750
Stop talking nonsense...

123
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,649
Shall we...

124
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,318
become partners?

125
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,819
I think I can help you a lot.

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,829
Well...

127
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,199
Where does that sound keep coming from?

128
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,439
Your alarm keeps going off.

129
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,540
Abnormal pulse. Caution.

130
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,709
- Gosh. - Your heart rate is rising.

131
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,149
Is it broken?

132
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,720
The machine is working normally.

133
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,789
Yes.

134
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,460
You're aroused.

135
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,029
Try to calm down and breathe.

136
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:47,029
It's going crazy. What's wrong with this? It won't shut off.

137
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,929
- It's malfunctioning. Come on. - I don't want to be turned off.

138
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,009
That smart watch is like a real person.

139
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,179
It's a smart watch our company plans to launch.

140
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,649
Just ignore it. Let's continue our conversation.

141
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,759
Right. We were talking about something important.

142
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,159
No.

143
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,159
We don't have anything else to talk about with you.

144
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,200
Your YouTube video is not the same as a television broadcast.

145
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,600
How so?

146
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,599
I'm a YouTuber with a silver button and 200,000 subscribers.

147
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,609
I know what people want more than you.

148
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,570
In both dating and in content ideas too.

149
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,179
Kyung Tae.

150
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,419
This new show is important, right?

151
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,789
You need a professional.

152
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,629
Gosh. How can dating fools make a dating show?

153
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,570
What? You're being too harsh.

154
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,340
These days, there is even a market for dating.

155
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,179
You can't do it with imagination. Only amateurs do that.

156
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,240
You need an expert.

157
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,049
Who dated recently out of you three?

158
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
No one, right?

159
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,360
Have you ever seen a dating show without an expert?

160
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:29,199
You need someone with experience who can give advice.

161
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,138
That'll allow viewers to have trust in the show...

162
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,669
and lead to word of mouth.

163
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,009
On top of that, I can promote it through my channel.

164
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,679
Right.

165
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,849
You'll need at least a few months...

166
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,320
to recruit famous panellists.

167
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,789
Forget it if you don't want to.

168
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,789
I'll just share my expertise on my channel instead.

169
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm going to get busy soon, so I'll excuse myself.

170
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,029
Wait.

171
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,139
Fine. Let's work together.

172
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,269
But...

173
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,580
no manipulating like last time.

174
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,210
Why the sudden change of heart?

175
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,919
Because...

176
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,489
you're a dating expert. I admit.

177
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,019
So let's work together.

178
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,129
I'll have to think about it.

179
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,100
Fine.

180
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,899
What good are friends for?

181
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,139
I'll help you.

182
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,909
Okay.

183
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:44,840
Thanks...

184
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,519
Young Sim, I'll get going.

185
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,230
By the way, Kyung Tae, do you plan to keep on staying here?

186
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,769
Why do you ask?

187
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,480
It must be uncomfortable with just one bathroom.

188
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,509
Yes, that must be inconvenient.

189
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,719
Do you want me to help you look for a place...

190
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,289
that's cozier, more comfortable, with more than two bathrooms?

191
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,960
Will you?

192
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,189
Keep it down for the neighbours. What are you doing?

193
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,758
- Hello. - Hello.

194
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,370
Did you come over to hang out, Wol Sook and Chae Dong?

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,970
Were you guys always close?

196
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,100
Did you enjoy eating something nice without me?

197
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,769
You told us not to bother you when you were taking a break.

198
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,909
Right. Your bath bomb. I forgot.

199
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:56,210
Yes...

200
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,750
I sent a text to Kyung Tae earlier because he wasn't home.

201
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,349
Yes, I saw it.

202
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,859
I was out for a quick run.

203
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,090
I see. Did you eat something?

204
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,929
I'll make something while you shower.

205
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,970
I'm going to go in.

206
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,129
Bye.

207
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,700
Me too.

208
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,008
- Goodnight, Kyung Tae. - Sleep tight, Young Sim.

209
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,570
- Let's go in. - Yes.

210
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:24,609
Bye.

211
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,709
- Goodnight. - Bye.

212
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,239
- See you later. - Okay.

213
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,509
We'll visit again soon.

214
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,219
For your own good, you better forget about...

215
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,720
whatever you saw today.

216
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:43,230
Look who's talking. Don't ever touch me again.

217
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,830
You little...

218
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,830
Gosh.

219
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,409
It's too dangerous to leave them together.

220
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,940
Exactly. I'm glad we came today.

221
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,249
Since we'll be working together now,

222
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,149
let's try our best to cooperate...

223
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
in various ways.

224
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Let's go.

225
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,289
Wait for me.

226
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,929
Gosh.

227
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,490
Darn it.

228
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,620
Why is it so hot?

229
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,029
Was it because I didn't run in a while?

230
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,759
Or was it because of what I saw?

231
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,470
Gosh.

232
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,139
I better sleep.

233
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,019
Let's sleep...

234
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,909
Ji Yu.

235
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,649
Are you studying? Do you want a snack?

236
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:45,220
No, thank you.

237
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,649
Why didn't you join us for dinner?

238
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,690
What is it? Did something happen?

239
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,789
No.

240
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,230
I just don't have an appetite.

241
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm going to study.

242
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,360
Okay.

243
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,929
Good luck, honey.

244
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,759
I heard something suspicious from the bathroom.

245
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,190
Hurry up. Turn your head and close your eyes.

246
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,929
Gosh. I know there's nothing to see.

247
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:33,128
What? Did you see it? You did, didn't you?

248
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,700
- Did you see it? - No, I didn't.

249
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,940
Hey, what are you doing?

250
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:45,580
You're so naughty.

251
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:48,879
How cute.

252
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,379
The room was steamy.

253
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,990
Aunt Young Sim and Kyung Tae were looking...

254
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,460
into each other's eyes.

255
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,389
They were touching each other,

256
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,259
and they were short on breath.

257
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,500
I heard strange noises...

258
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,500
What was that about?

259
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,309
What?

260
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:03,619
Oh, my.

261
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,719
Do you hate me that much?

262
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,460
I told you not to come anywhere near me.

263
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,859
Even so, you don't have to look so disgusted.

264
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:18,240
Calm down.

265
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,038
Welcome to the kickoff meeting for our new show.

266
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,809
("Three Couples Under One Roof")

267
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,180
Let's take a look at the screen for our new show's concept.

268
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,219
Six different men and women...

269
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,589
who have never met will live under the same roof for three weeks.

270
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,318
We will be observing and filming...

271
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,659
the naturally occurring feelings that develop over those three weeks.

272
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,558
After the three weeks have passed, we will ask the participants...

273
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,169
about their true feelings and support them where we can.

274
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,140
It's an innocent and unintrusive observational dating show.

275
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,009
"Three Couples Under One Roof."

276
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,940
Producer Oh?

277
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,710
I'm very disappointed by this.

278
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,048
This is no better or worse...

279
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,450
than a live-in version of "The Arrows of Love."

280
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,190
But it's much more than that.

281
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,960
It's using our intellectual property that is gaining notoriety.

282
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,159
Retro is on-trend and observational variety shows are having a moment.

283
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,159
We'll take that and add sincerity into the mix...

284
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,298
In terms of dating shows,

285
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,999
there are already live-in, survival, exposure,

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,069
sports, and even alternate reality formats that exist.

287
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,740
There's nothing ground breaking that sets us apart in this!

288
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,180
Well,

289
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,349
Mr. Wang.

290
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,420
It's not like dating...

291
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,719
can be likened to a food tour of all the best restaurants.

292
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,518
What happens if we try something too outrageous,

293
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,758
and it leads to more controversies?

294
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,559
Are you going to take responsibility?

295
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,259
Well, are you?

296
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,809
Mr. Wang!

297
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:10,049
Excuse me, Mr. Wang?

298
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,220
It's polite to answer when someone is calling you.

299
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,559
Irregular pulse. Warning.

300
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,730
Your heart is racing.

301
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,599
- Mr. Wang? - Yes?

302
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,069
That's the most unique idea...

303
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,609
out of all you've mentioned so far.

304
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,039
"Tour of all the best."

305
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,880
Darn you, Kyung Tae.

306
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,380
I could just break something over his head right now.

307
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,789
No. Restrain yourself.

308
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,119
We agreed not to use violence.

309
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,460
What does everyone think about that?

310
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,759
I'm open to discussing everyone's ideas.

311
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:05,099
Chae Dong, I need you to hold me back.

312
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,769
Stop me before I actually become violent.

313
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,079
Hey.

314
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,950
Can I ask you for a favour?

315
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,779
What is it?

316
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,549
It's about your Aunt Young Sim and Kyung Tae.

317
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:26,720
If you think something is happening between Kyung Tae and Young Sim,

318
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,490
would you be able to tell me right away?

319
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,400
- Chae Dong? - Chae Dong,

320
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,058
Aunt Young Sim...

321
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,099
- Hey. - and Kyung Tae...

322
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,670
were all intertwined in the bathroom yesterday.

323
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,839
Chae Dong? Hey!

324
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:41,640
- Gosh. - Be careful.

325
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,710
Young Sim?

326
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,108
There is only one bathroom in this house.

327
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,180
We were fighting over it when you came.

328
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,329
Chae Dong?

329
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,339
This is the Kingvely meeting, right?

330
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,380
Hi, Young Sim.

331
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,690
Should we take a break, Young Sim?

332
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,589
Sure. Let's reconvene after a ten-minute break.

333
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,789
Why do you keep looking at me?

334
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:17,829
What are you playing at?

335
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,039
Mr. Wang.

336
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,569
When are you going to leave Young Sim's house?

337
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,710
What does that have to do with you?

338
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,950
If you won't leave, I'll drag you out myself.

339
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,359
What a nutcase.

340
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,740
Why was he staring?

341
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,309
Mr. Wang, we will edit the current proposal.

342
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,309
Do you have time to rewrite it?

343
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,818
We will try our best to incorporate any good ideas...

344
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,680
that Kingvely passes on to us.

345
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,690
It took you long enough.

346
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,359
I would like for Kingvely's identity to be very much on display.

347
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,390
I think the things that only Kingvely can do...

348
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,289
will be what sets us apart.

349
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,899
But you know, having such obvious product placements...

350
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,769
can actually backfire these days.

351
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,299
It's your job to make it seem less obvious.

352
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,210
Make it subtle but powerful.

353
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,980
Don't make a fuss but make sure it's impressive.

354
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,950
Is that so difficult?

355
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,849
How would that be possible?

356
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,348
Should the staff at Kingvely all go on blind dates...

357
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:41,950
with the staff working on the show?

358
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,049
Why on earth would we go on blind dates?

359
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,859
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,399
Well, I guess the strong resistance to that idea...

361
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,900
means that it won't be possible.

362
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,568
If you had done a good job to start with,

363
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:00,369
this would never have happened.

364
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,808
You're the one who complained about the good job I did.

365
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,579
It wasn't a complaint, it was a fair request.

366
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,349
Don't you remember the reason...

367
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,950
why we're able to make this show in the first place?

368
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,479
The planning and production costs...

369
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,119
are all being covered by Kingvely!

370
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:18,049
And that's your leverage for making ridiculous demands?

371
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,160
Who cares if you're a CEO when your personality is a mess?

372
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:23,029
Is money all there is to life?

373
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,400
Wait. Excuse me?

374
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,900
Please, look over here.

375
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,170
I think we need to spend some time getting to know each other.

376
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,140
Let's go on a work retreat!

377
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,480
We're at the beach!

378
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,980
- This is amazing. - Did we need to come this far?

379
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,190
It's great.

380
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,089
I guess it's nice having a break for the first time in a while.

381
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,699
- One is one, not two - One is one, not two.

382
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,298
- Two is two, not three - Two is two, not three

383
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,038
I'll keep an eye on Young Sim to make sure...

384
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,470
she doesn't get distracted.

385
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,609
- Four is four, not five - Four is four, not five.

386
00:26:58,859 --> 00:26:59,859
By the way,

387
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,329
this beach and the vacation house...

388
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,690
are owned by Kingvely? All of it?

389
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes.

390
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,058
When he came here to watch the commercial shoot,

391
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,768
he found out about an auction for this land.

392
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,230
So he bought everything.

393
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,940
- That's so cool. - Right?

394
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,849
He seems to buy things left and right.

395
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,720
Thanks to him, we have this entire beach to ourselves.

396
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,519
It was so awesome of me to suggest a work retreat!

397
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,829
All right. Let the game begin!

398
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,630
- Yes! - Yes!

399
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,798
The direction of our program...

400
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,299
and the production budget will depend on this important game.

401
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,109
You two should make a bet.

402
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:53,039
Then we want...

403
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:55,710
We want 150 percent more of our current budget!

404
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,910
- Yes! - Yes!

405
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:01,049
You heard her.

406
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,950
Okay.

407
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,058
Then I want my company's logo...

408
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,959
in the opening segment of every episode...

409
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,588
and a special soundtrack for my company.

410
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:11,029
And lastly, I want everyone on the show...

411
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,299
to wear clothes from my company in every episode!

412
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:16,829
- You got this, Mr. Wang! - That's so cool!

413
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,339
- Is that even possible? - I'm not sure.

414
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:21,700
Chae Dong, you heard him. Right?

415
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,039
Let's call it. It's on!

416
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,979
- Give him a round of applause! - Yes!

417
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,919
- Look at his amazing muscles! - Chae Dong is the best!

418
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,719
Mr. Wang, take off your shirt too!

419
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,319
- You got this, Chae Dong! - Let's go!

420
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,750
I won't go easy on you.

421
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,759
You're chatty.

422
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:41,319
All right. Get ready.

423
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,180
What? Wait.

424
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,380
Hey. What's happening?

425
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,589
Isn't this cheating? He's cheating!

426
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,170
Gosh, I can't watch this.

427
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,569
It looks like you need to work out more, Mr. Wang.

428
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,970
Anyway, isn't Chae Dong really great?

429
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,569
He is strong indeed.

430
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,779
Chae Dong, throw him down!

431
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,980
I'm almost done here, Young Sim.

432
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,519
Throw him down!

433
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:44,990
Is there anything you're good at?

434
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,690
You also don't have a driven mindset.

435
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,769
Kingvely takes the win.

436
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,349
That was so cool, Mr. Wang.

437
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,920
Sports aren't just about strength.

438
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,930
Strategy is key.

439
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,299
Mr. Wang.

440
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,640
- Are you ready? - Yes.

441
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,910
What was that?

442
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,880
You look very tired, Soon Sim.

443
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,278
I'll take this round. You should rest up.

444
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,349
She's so annoying. What was that?

445
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,019
If Kingvely wins this game,

446
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,160
I will cut down the budget by 30 percent!

447
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,430
If we win, you have to put up a banner of our program...

448
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,069
on your main website throughout the length of our program.

449
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,039
And...

450
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,308
once the program ends,

451
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,109
you must provide hotel vouchers to everyone on the production team.

452
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,349
- Gosh. - Yes!

453
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:22,619
Chae Dong.

454
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,159
Whatever happens... Even if I fall during the game,

455
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,059
you cannot go soft and must drag me all the way to the line.

456
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,930
- Okay. - Put your arm around me.

457
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,768
- Oh Young Sim! - Kingvely!

458
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:41,469
- Oh Young Sim! - Kingvely!

459
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,369
- One, two. - Kingvely!

460
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,539
Oh, no.

461
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,140
Come on. What was that?

462
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,450
Now of all times? Get up. Hurry.

463
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,609
- Get on my back. - Gosh.

464
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,649
- Get on my back. - On your back?

465
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,880
Go ahead. Hurry.

466
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,018
One, two.

467
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,490
- Gosh. I think I'm going to fall. - One, two. We're almost there.

468
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,989
Gosh, this isn't going to work.

469
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,028
Darn it. No.

470
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,029
We won!

471
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,930
Jang Hwan. Sang Eun. We won!

472
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,829
- Mr. Wang! - Gosh.

473
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,240
Hey!

474
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,569
- Hotel vouchers! - Hotel vouchers!

475
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,339
We get to stay at a hotel for free!

476
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,529
Right.

477
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,730
I have something to say.

478
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,629
First of all, I want to thank Mr. Wang...

479
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,099
for letting us stay here at this work retreat.

480
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,539
I want to take this chance...

481
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,739
to express my sincere gratitude.

482
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,970
So I want to make a toast.

483
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,539
Please cheer for me even if it's not funny.

484
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,210
I want to give a toast in French.

485
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,809
Don't eat the French toast. Let's drink!

486
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:01,079
- It's nice to be working together. - I'm looking forward to it.

487
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,319
This is nice.

488
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,989
- Gosh. - This one was tasty.

489
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,990
This is delicious.

490
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,389
- I shouldn't drink a lot. - There's something I want to do.

491
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,659
- All right. The initial game. - The initial game.

492
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,399
- Earthworm! - I told him...

493
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,569
- That's not what you play it. - What?

494
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,789
Is he okay?

495
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,599
Gosh.

496
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,369
Goodness.

497
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,109
Why did I hurt my ankle of all body parts?

498
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,509
Are you here to sober up?

499
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:06,619
Why do you care?

500
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,119
You're such a bother.

501
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,090
You're making it really obvious the way you're limping.

502
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,000
You hurt your ankle when we were playing games, right?

503
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,630
- Let me see. - Mind your own business.

504
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,699
I'm fine.

505
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,829
If you don't treat it, it will swell even more. Come here.

506
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,210
You were overdoing yourself while playing ssireum.

507
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,570
You could have just let him win.

508
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,739
I'm a man. A real man doesn't lose.

509
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,820
Hey, it swelled a lot more than I expected.

510
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,149
Gosh. That's nothing. Wait.

511
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,389
- You're spraying way too much. - Gosh.

512
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,718
Goodness.

513
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,360
You used to be such a crybaby, and you still haven't changed.

514
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,300
Gosh.

515
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,030
You haven't changed one bit.

516
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,469
- Gosh. - Why did you spray so much?

517
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,070
All done.

518
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:01,570
Get your leg off me.

519
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,610
I'm going to watch the waves alone.

520
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,309
You should go.

521
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,050
You bought the entire beach. Seriously.

522
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,780
You can watch the waves whenever you want to.

523
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,949
The last time I was at the beach was ten years ago.

524
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,389
I didn't even have time to look at beach photos. I only worked.

525
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,500
Hearing that won't make me feel bad for you.

526
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,239
Why aren't you leaving?

527
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:41,840
Well,

528
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,510
you helped me when I was in danger.

529
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,559
A long time ago,

530
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:55,860
when we went to the beach with our friends in the summer,

531
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,730
I almost drowned. I'm talking about that.

532
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,800
Help!

533
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:04,829
It's too deep here.

534
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,039
- Young Sim, it's too dangerous! - Help!

535
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,038
- Young Sim! - Save Young Sim first!

536
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,650
- What do we do? - Save Young Sim first!

537
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,618
Young Sim, wake up.

538
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:21,719
You can't die.

539
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,889
I must save her.

540
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,360
Just like I learned in class, breathe into her mouth.

541
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,599
You knew about that?

542
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:43,809
Yes.

543
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,280
Things were hazy.

544
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,409
But oddly, I do remember that clearly.

545
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,820
Soon Sim told my dad everything when he bribed her.

546
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:59,119
It was in the cartoon too. Did you not see that?

547
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,789
I didn't have time to watch the cartoon.

548
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,630
I rarely went to the beach. Remember?

549
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,829
You're always bragging.

550
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,400
What about your dad?

551
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,409
Is he still drawing the cartoon?

552
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,710
I think he wants to,

553
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,719
but his health and inspiration aren't as strong as before.

554
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,420
Even so,

555
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,489
I cannot let my guard down.

556
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,659
My dad has a sixth sense...

557
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,889
when it comes to noticing changes in my life.

558
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,729
Then what if this gets turned into a cartoon later?

559
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,730
Then...

560
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:44,829
You startled me.

561
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,099
Hey.

562
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,909
I told you not to lower your guard.

563
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,969
We might end up in the cartoon again.

564
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,449
Then why did you pretend...

565
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,320
you didn't know about that?

566
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,789
I didn't want to admit...

567
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,360
that it was...

568
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,969
my first kiss.

569
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,969
Are you really upset that I was your first kiss?

570
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,238
That's not what I said.

571
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,670
It's not that.

572
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,340
Then what about you? Why did you...

573
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,949
disappear without saying goodbye?

574
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,309
You promised.

575
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,219
I still don't get it.

576
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,059
All those years ago,

577
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:47,860
why...

578
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,099
did you disappear without saying goodbye?

579
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,039
That's...

580
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:04,650
Young Sim! Kyung Tae! What are you doing?

581
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,179
Come back!

582
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,280
Okay.

583
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,449
Okay. We'll be there soon.

584
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,889
I was wondering when they had disappeared.

585
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:16,559
They were together.

586
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,670
Let's go.

587
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,230
Let's go.

588
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,170
Gosh.

589
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,340
Goodness.

590
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,239
Oh, my leg.

591
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,179
Gosh.

592
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,489
Hurry up and sit down.

593
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,260
Hurry back!

594
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,159
Chae Dong, this isn't the time to drink.

595
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,599
- That hurts. - Cheers.

596
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,869
- Come already. - Cheers.

597
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,030
Let's drink.

598
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,670
Everyone.

599
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:07,839
All right. For our last game,

600
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,179
why don't we play truth or dare?

601
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:13,150
- Yes! - Sounds good.

602
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,619
Mr. Wang. Draw the question.

603
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,590
Do we have to play this?

604
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,500
What does this have to do with bonding as a team?

605
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,730
All right. If you don't want to answer it, you'll have to drink.

606
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,179
So I just draw one from there?

607
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,420
This one looks good.

608
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,860
(Do you think first love comes true?)

609
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,559
Do I have to answer this?

610
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,829
What's the question?

611
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,170
"Do you think..."

612
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:07,570
"first love comes true? Yes or no?"

613
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,949
Mr. Wang. You need to answer that.

614
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,960
I think it comes true.

615
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,030
Goodness.

616
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,670
That's so romantic.

617
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,269
- Oh, my. - What was that?

618
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,039
All right. I'm going to spin it again.

619
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,909
It makes no sense that I got picked twice in a row.

620
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,050
Did you put something under the table?

621
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,789
This is a weird game.

622
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,159
The questions are weird too.

623
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,300
(Do you have romantic feelings for someone who is present here?)

624
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,869
Gosh. Come on. What kind of question is that?

625
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,909
How could I draw this of all questions?

626
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,369
What's the question?

627
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,750
"Do you have romantic feelings for someone who is present here?"

628
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,880
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

629
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,389
Drink the penalty shot.

630
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,170
Mr. Wang. You should answer the question.

631
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,139
The penalty is pretty intense.

632
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,440
What's the penalty?

633
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:55,138
"Drink a shot with the person on your right..."

634
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,179
"with arms intertwined."

635
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,849
What is this?

636
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:05,320
"Do you have romantic feelings..."

637
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:09,090
"for someone who is present here?"

638
00:43:56,466 --> 00:43:59,510
(Oh! YoungSim)

639
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:02,909
"When was the last time you were intimate with someone?"

640
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,449
Gosh.

641
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,050
That wasn't an intimate moment?

642
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:09,719
What's he talking about, Young Sim?

643
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:11,750
Did something between you two that night?

644
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,388
"Love Mark."

645
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:15,659
You will mark love?

646
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,360
I'll believe in Kingvely.

647
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:19,558
Don't laugh.

648
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,029
What? Why did you hit me?

649
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,869
Hey, don't you think they resemble each other?

650
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,929
They don't resemble each other. They don't make a good couple.

651
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,238
My goodness.

652
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,639
This many people wrote to us?

653
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,908
So many people were on our website late at night.

654
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,010
And our website was down for a while.

655
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,510
I ended up liking her for who she was.

656
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,480
I really hope you can help me.

657
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:39,949
I'm against it.

658
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,549
But he must be desperate for our help.

659
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,920
He came all the way here.

660
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,219
Chae Dong.

661
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:47,090
Look at you. You're all grown up, worrying about your senior.

662
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,789
Goodness.

663
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,389
I'm a man too, Young Sim.

664
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:53,429
Hey, what's gotten into you?
