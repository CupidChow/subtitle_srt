1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,870

2
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,630

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,610

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,980

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,450

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,870

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,390

8
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,790
They say at least one of your wishes come true for sure when you pray here.

9
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,760
Really?

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,240
I think if Buddha here smiles after you pray, then your wish will be granted.

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,550
Come on. That can't be real.

12
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,540
It's for real.

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,170
This place got famous for it, so people form lines on New Year's.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,200
Really?

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,370
Then, should I give it a shot?

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,980

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,600
That's it.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
What did you wish for?

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,810
Wait a second.

20
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,830
Let me see if Buddha smiles or not.

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,000
It looks like he's smiling... but maybe not.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,930
I can't really tell because it's too dark.

23
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,130
What do you think?

24
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,860
In my opinion... I think he's got a smile on his face.

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,360
- Really? 
 - Yes.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,030
This place must really like me, then.

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,000
In that case, I'll pray for your wish as well.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,030
Tell me what it is.

29
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,130
My wish?

30
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,020
Yes. I'll put in the request along with mine.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,380
I've got a great feeling.

32
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,840
Go on and tell me. Quickly.

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,320
Hurry up. Come on and tell me.

34
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,440
Hurry—

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,630
I like you, Senio.

36
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,660
My wish is... that you'll also like me, Senior.

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,370
- Stop joking— 
 - Whoa!

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,680

39
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll really take you down!

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,520
Where do you think you're going?

41
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,680
You can't beat me, all right?

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,680
You can never beat me. You understand?

43
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,140
W-Wait a second!

44
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,360
Let me go...

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,710
I really can't breathe!

46
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,750
Who on Earth did this?

47
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,570
Why did I have to be in the same room with him?

48
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,320

49
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,010
Gosh, how should I deal with that guy?

50
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,480
I should just!

51
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,520
Gosh! That little...

52
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,660
Geez! That Kingvely...

53
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,390
He dodged?

54
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,510
So comfy...

55
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,210
Wang Kyeong Tae, that asshole!

56
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,360
 We're going into shoot now.

57
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,830
 Nam Ki Ho, please come out if you're ready.

58
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,800
Oh, Yeo Wool!

59
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,280
You woke up very early.

60
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,420
- Yes. Did you get a good sleep? 
 - Yes.

61
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,260
 Don't scratch your head.

62
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,420
Square your shoulders.

63
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,480
Well... wh-what were you doing?

64
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,100
Everyone sweeps the yard together at temples in the morning.

65
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,640
Let me join you.

66
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,500
- Ki Ho! 
 - Yes?

67
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,680
Yes.

68
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,310
Your style changed a lot.

69
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,350
Yes.

70
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,430
-  Lower your hand!  
 - Whoa!

71
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,360
What's wrong?

72
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,650
Well, I gave my looks a do-over.

73
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,920
What do you think?

74
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,530
Well...

75
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,340
the thing is, it's not exactly appropriate for labor.

76
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,440
You'll need one of these to be comfortable.

77
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,470
Ki Ho, you can't.

78
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,100
So much work went into your getup!

79
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,210
-  You better not—  
 - I'll go get changed right away.

80
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,950
Okay.

81
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,490
Just let Ki Ho do as he wants.

82
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,280
If he was going to do as he wanted, why did he even come out on this show?

83
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,570
But still, Ki Ho isn't your avatar.

84
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,580
 We'll start our own little secret dating relationship.

85
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,220
 I'll hide it thoroughly, so no one... will get suspicious.

86
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,170
 Sure.

87
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:07,360
 Let's enjoy the heck out of this thrilling experience together.

88
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,100
 You two will make your own memories at the sacred workplace?

89
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,650
- Wait, Ki Ho! 
 - Yes?

90
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,270
I already swept this area.

91
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,260
- You can go over there and sweep. 
 - O-Oh, okay.

92
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,530
- Over there, okay? 
 - Yes.

93
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,410
No, it's over there. All the way over there.

94
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,800
You can go over there and sweep.

95
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,530
Okay.

96
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,320
Good morning!

97
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,620
What's up with the atmosphere?

98
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,420
Oh, my! Why does it look so drab?

99
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,610
Weren't we shooting a variety show, not a documentary?

100
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,680
Drabness isn't even the problem right now.

101
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,270
They haven't talked in 10 minutes. They're just sweeping the yard.

102
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,620
Whose idea was this?

103
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,340
Yeo Wool wanted to do it, so I did give her my okay.

104
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,620
What's next on the schedule, then?

105
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,820
Buddhist meditation—

106
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,910
Whoa, my—

107
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,570
Are you kidding me right now?

108
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,220
Kidding? Do I look like I'm kidding?

109
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,880
I've been too nice. What did you just say?

110
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,000
- Senior— 
 - Please calm down. We don't have time for this.

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,080
Let me see the schedule.

112
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,830
What is this?

113
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,270
Hey, Oh Young Shim, are you out of your mind?

114
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,790
We're not shooting a Buddhist show, are we?

115
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,600
It ended up that way, trying to accept a lot of Yeo Wool's ideas.

116
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Gosh, darn it. We can't go on like this.

117
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,940
Did he say I'm kidding?

118
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,490
Do I look like I came this far to kid around?

119
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,920
Gosh, really. I'm so mad.

120
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,470
Why did he become so mean?

121
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,060
- Gosh— 
 - Young Shim!

122
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,450
Yes, yes, Wol Sook.

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,530
Did something happen between you and Kyeong Tae while I wasn't around?

124
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,840
Gosh, what could've happened?

125
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,440
I don't think Kyeong Tae would act like that for no reason.

126
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,050
I mean...

127
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,360
he seemed to be getting nicer lately but became as mean as ever overnight.

128
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,290
Kyeong Tae does have the bad boy vibe.

129
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,720
He's not a bad boy. He's just a mean boy.

130
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,010
He keeps picking fights with me and getting mad.

131
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,460
I don't know what's wrong with him. Getting on my nerves.

132
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,390
He's getting on your nerves? Why?

133
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,590
It's not like this is the first time Kyeong Tae's acting like that.

134
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,350
I mean...

135
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,020
there are a lot of people over there, as you saw...

136
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,320
but he keeps getting mad and aggressive. That's why.

137
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,010
Is that right?

138
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,850
I'll care for Kyeong Tae from now on, so you can stop worrying about him.

139
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,650
What?

140
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,750
I'm going to try hitting it off with Kyeong Tae.

141
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,050
I tried to get closer to him at the last workshop, but the situation didn't help at all.

142
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,960
I hope you'll help me out.

143
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,020
Why would I?

144
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,090
Do you like Kyeong Tae?

145
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,950
 Hello, my name is Mark, CEO Wang Kyeong Tae of Kingvely.

146
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,860
Hey! What the heck are you saying?

147
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,790
H-Hey, that's nonsense.

148
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,020
Why would I like Wang Kyeong Tae?

149
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,420
You can't even say that as a joke.

150
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,110
What kind of nonsense is that? No, no!

151
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,890
It's not like that.

152
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,780
If you dislike him that badly... it's good news for me.

153
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,360
Then, you don't need to help me out, so just don't get in the way.

154
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,830
You got it?

155
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,100
Be a good friend to me.

156
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,410
O-Oh... yeah...

157
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,690
 We're ready to go for yoga time.

158
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,210
Okay, we'll be right there!

159
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,620
- Let's go do yoga. 
 - Okay!

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,530
Please bring the clothing over here.

161
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,310
Just open up the mats and tell me if the logos came out nicely.

162
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,390
- Oh, they came out fine. 
 - Secretary Oh?

163
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,290
Yes, CEO Wang.

164
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,890
- Are we good to go? 
 - Yes.

165
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,400
We brought the products from our office and finished putting our logo on them.

166
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,790
Great.

167
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,850
By the way, how did you come up with this idea?

168
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,590
There was a yoga lesson scheduled during today's temple stay.

169
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,410

170
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,390
It's the only justifiable skinship allowed in the temple.

171
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,600
- Excuse me for a second. 
 - Yes.

172
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,540
Let me see.

173
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,570
This way a bit.

174
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,150
Close up whenever you can, all right?

175
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,660
Kingvely's logo must be seen as well as possible from every angle.

176
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,670
Yes.

177
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, close up from this side.

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,210
And also, tell them not to block the logo when they're doing yoga.

179
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,850
Sorry?

180
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,350
Oh, okay. I understand.

181
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,490
Now, the first position is the triangle pose.

182
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,370
Place your feet far apart from each other and raise your arms like this.

183
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,100
We'll start with the left side first.

184
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,790
Place your left hand behind your left foot

185
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,490
and fix your eyes on the tip of your right arm.

186
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,800
The second position is the eagle position.

187
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,840
Twist your right arm like this and push your palms against each other.

188
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,480
Then, twist your right leg like this.

189
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,950
Hey, watch out! Get out of the way!

190
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,170
What's her problem now, even at this place?

191
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,060
Sorry.

192
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,640
You've got a lot of worries in your heart.

193
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,790
Concentrate.

194
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,530
Do I really need to do this all the way out here?

195
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,570
Now, please pair up with another person.

196
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,920
The next position is couples yoga.

197
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,730
Yes. We'll do this. I'll pair up with Yeo Wool.

198
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,150
Should I go for Kyeong Tae?

199
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,560
- Then, I'll— 
 - I'll pair up with Wol Sook, then.

200
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,720
Me?

201
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,780
You're pairing up with me? Why?

202
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,040
Just because. I just want to get closer to you.

203
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,170
But I want to do it with Kyeong Tae.

204
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,130
Please pair up with me.

205
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,680
What?

206
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,330
 You're going to date in complete secret, huh?

207
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,220
All right, then.

208
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,620
The remaining two people can pair up.

209
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay.

210
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,170
The first position of couples yoga is the bat pose.

211
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,010
Spread your legs and lean forward.

212
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,080
Ladies, who are standing, gently press down on the gentlemen's backs.

213
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,550
Ki Ho, did you put on cologne?

214
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,560
 If you can't wear the clothes... put this on, at least.

215
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,640
 You can do this much, right?

216
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,690
 Oh, yes. Of course.

217
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,830
 And then, you must tell her this.

218
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,610
 Repeat after me.

219
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:10,920
 The new men's... cologne Kingvely...

220
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,950
 The new men's cologne Kingvely...

221
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,050
 collaborated with...

222
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,430
 - a long-time French perfumery... 
 - a long-time French perfumery...

223
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,890
 - to develop is... 
 - to develop is...

224
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,100
The emerald-colored sea, much like the Mediterranean Sea.

225
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,950
Don't you even smell the scents of the fruits that are basking in the sun?

226
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,540
If you sign up now, you'll get a discount coupon and two times the reward points.

227
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,490
Great.

228
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,310
If you put on this King Ocean Pour Homme Niche cologne,

229
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,560
you'll earn a perfect,

230
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,560
charming man's scent that will stay on you for an entire day.

231
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,060
Please focus on the pose.

232
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,910
All right, bat pose.

233
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,800
Breathe in, and when you breathe out...

234
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,080
tuck in your stomach, chest, and lastly, your chin, as deeply as possible.

235
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,870
Okay, breathe out.

236
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,880
M-My legs are going to rip!

237
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
No, Ki Ho, you can do it.

238
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,330
- N-No— 
 - Look at them over there.

239
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,080
Okay!

240
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,100
 Do it properly!

241
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,130
Put your heart into it.

242
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,430
Gosh, stop making me talk.

243
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,890
Is this all you can do, Kingvely?

244
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,910
 Abnormal pulse. Warning.

245
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,800
 Your heart is racing.

246
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,620
 User's excitement has been detected.

247
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,190
 Please stop your excitement.

248
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,570
Excitement?

249
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,250
N-No, no, that's not it!

250
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,610
 Consecutive abnormal pulses have been detected.

251
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,930
Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth!

252
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,910
Shut it!

253
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,130
Ki Ho, are you okay?

254
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,820
- Is it this leg— 
 - No, don't!

255
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,650
Wh-Why, why?

256
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,880
Are you okay?

257
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,960
My goodness, what do I do?

258
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,610
Are you okay?

259
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,810
What if Yeo Wool got disappointed, thinking I was a wimp?

260
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,160
Disappointment can happen only if she likes you.

261
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,030
You're not in the stage to worry about that.

262
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,170
Wang Kyeong Tae sure has his way with his words.

263
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,830
This is all because we were doing yoga for your sake.

264
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,100
Yes, Kyeong Tae.

265
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,940
Your heart's signal was bouncing up and down earlier.

266
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,400
Do you have a chronic illness?

267
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,420
Or was it because your circulation was too good?

268
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,380
It was because it was broken.

269
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,050
What did the watch do wrong now?

270
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,110
Mind your own business.

271
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,300
We need to focus on what to do next.

272
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,410
As I expected... he didn't have any chances.

273
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,100
I agree.

274
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,260
Based on my observations from earlier...

275
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,490
I'm sure Yeo Wool considers Ki Ho as nothing more than a coworker.

276
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,130
What do we do, then?

277
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,100
There is this one last method...

278
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,100
Operation Jealousy.

279
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,430
You're getting a call there. A phone call.

280
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,870
It's Jenny.

281
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,170
I wonder why Jenny is calling.

282
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,130
Hello?

283
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,520
Oppa, it's me, Jenny.

284
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,640
What are you doing right now?

285
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,190
Oh, I'm eating right now.

286
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,860
Have you eaten, Jenny?

287
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,760
I'll ask you to buy me a drink, so hang up after giving some room for misunderstanding.

288
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,370
Yes— Oh...

289
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,080
Yes, okay. Sure.

290
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,480
Oppa, buy me some drinks in the evening.

291
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,700
Oh, drinks? In the evening?

292
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,750
But I'm a little busy at the moment.

293
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,000
Well...

294
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,160
in that case, I will call you back later.

295
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,490
Yes.

296
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,150
Okay.

297
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,740
Who was that?

298
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,320
It's a friend I met at a social gathering.

299
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,090
But she keeps calling me.

300
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,090
I'm done eating. I'm going to the restroom.

301
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,360
Wait, i-it's a guy.

302
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,300
I-Is this okay?

303
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,760
She couldn't have been offended, right?

304
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,690
That's a good result because that's what jealousy is.

305
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,660
It was the most meaningful reaction Jeong Yeo Wool has shown so far.

306
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,540
Does that mean it really had an effect?

307
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,880
- Ki Ho... 
 - Yes.

308
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,410
Do you want to go to the wishing rock with me later?

309
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,500
S-Sure.

310
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,670
I would like to talk to him alone quietly.

311
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,780
Oh, yes. That's fine. You can go ahead.

312
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,830
I'll see you later, then.

313
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,540
Okay.

314
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,010
I guess it really worked!

315
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,560
Seriously, I guess it did work.

316
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,920
I wish you good luck, Ki Ho.

317
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,610
Yes.

318
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,430
Wait, Ki Ho...

319
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,630
We just need to walk up this way.

320
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,810
Everyone besides the director, please retreat now.

321
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,310
How lovely, seriously.

322
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,700
We'll get a nice picture. Right?

323
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,110
 Is that PD and Oh Young Shim close?

324
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,630
 Close?

325
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,990
 I'm sure they're something more than that.

326
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:55,140
 We've been on the same team for only a year...

327
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,100
 but I love her.

328
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,560
 Chae Dong! Flip him over!

329
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,310
 Senior, it's almost over.

330
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:23,810
♫  Looking at the sight of you getting further away from me  ♫

331
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,030
♫  I couldn't bring myself to  ♫

332
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,380

333
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,940

334
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,660
♫  I can't even turn back  ♫

335
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,090
You think you'll be happy, huh?

336
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,060
Why am I feeling so nasty?

337
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,010
CEO Wang!

338
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,820
What are you doing here alone?

339
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,800
An important scene is soon to be filmed, so they told you to come.

340
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,450
Forget it.

341
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,230
Pardon?

342
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,620
We have to display one more PPL at a decisive scene.

343
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,040
We've got tons to do.

344
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,440
I said, forget it.

345
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,390
You were so enthusiastic about it earlier.

346
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,700
What's wrong all of a sudden?

347
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,810
I lost interest.

348
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,650
I'll go back to Seoul first.

349
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,670
Secretary Oh... I mean...

350
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,660
Soon Shim, wrap things up quickly and come.

351
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,850
It looks like this place will do fine without us.

352
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm going.

353
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,410
What's up with him?

354
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,550
It's that way.

355
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,300
I see.

356
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,450
This is called the wishing rock because at least one wish comes true when you pray here.

357
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,910
 When you arrive at the wishing rock, use that timing to confess to her.

358
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,080
 There's a high probability you'll succeed.

359
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,800
 Really?

360
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,630
 First off, coming to the wishing rock by yourselves

361
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,570
 would mean Yeo Wool opened her heart.

362
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,760
 And when you get that far, there's a high chance you'll be a couple.

363
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,600
 Really?

364
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,680
 I guess...

365
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,040
 it's because of the wishing rock, which grants people's wishes. Right?

366
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,440
 Give it all you've got.

367
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,980
 You might even get to hug her.

368
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,140
 Oh, a hug...

369
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,440
 Gosh, well, should I confess to her in a manly way or...

370
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,990
 should I make it more romantic?

371
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,890
 Relax. You'll just need to relax and let your heart talk.

372
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,880

373
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,660
Excuse me, Yeo Wool.

374
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,030
I've got something to tell you.

375
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,030
Of course, I'm sure you more or less know what it's about.

376
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,510
It's giving me butterflies!

377
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,190
Let's get ready for the touching moment.

378
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,760
Let's capture every moment and not miss a single one.

379
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,370
I also have something to confess to you.

380
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,620
Can I go first?

381
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,330
Sure.

382
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,840
It would be a lie to say I don't know

383
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,760
your feelings even when we came out...

384
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,280
on a show together. Right?

385
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,860
Oh...

386
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,590
I-I didn't pressure you too much, did I?

387
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,960
It did pressure me, but it was in a pleasant way.

388
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:08,460
I get confident out of nowhere when I see someone hesitating because of his feelings for me.

389
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,690
So I think it's a good thing for a person to like someone else.

390
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,990
Yeo Wool...

391
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,100
- Will you— 
 - But, Ki Ho, do you know this?

392
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,860
The adversity we face stems from our likes and dislikes.

393
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,630
The pain of love begins with liking someone, too.

394
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,790
Yes, that's right...

395
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:50,360
Isn't life all about overcoming... t-those obstacles?

396
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:57,960
I've thought about it for a while... and I've made up my mind.

397
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,180
To let go of all the love and hate

398
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,870
and walk alone like the horns of a Musso. 
  (Phrase from Buddhist scripture)

399
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,930
This is getting a bit weird.

400
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,810
For now... let's let them finish.

401
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,550
Well, walk where?

402
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,580
Alone?

403
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,560
Can't I walk with you?

404
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,370
No.

405
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,110
That road isn't made for two.

406
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,650
It's the road of asceticism.

407
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,520
Asceticism?

408
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,380
Is this a soap opera?

409
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,810
No...

410
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,360
 What kind of exercise do you do?

411
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,550
 Should we work out together, then?

412
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,080
 I think that will be a little difficult.

413
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,570
 What's the reason?

414
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,300
 I work out by doing 3,000 bows on the weekends.

415
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,100
This can't be...

416
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,640
No, Yeo Wool!

417
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,250
That's right.

418
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,680
I leave for Tibet soon.

419
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,390
To find myself.

420
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,180
Then, why did you participate in this program?

421
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,220
I wanted to make good memories with you for the last time.

422
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,600
I'm really selfish, huh?

423
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,360
Yes. You're very selfish.

424
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:39,140
I can... do anything for you, Yeo Wool.

425
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,340
Don't change yourself for someone else.

426
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,490
I liked you a lot more the way you were before we came here.

427
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,010
What's the point... of that now?

428
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,700
The way I was before! I had just failed.

429
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,620
Yeo Wool, you're really cruel.

430
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,420
Don't get in my way and move.

431
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,730
You're not one to stand there just because someone's in your way.

432
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,930
 I also have something to confess to you.

433
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,540
 I leave for Tibet soon.

434
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,580
 To find myself.

435
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,660
Damn it! I'm going nuts.

436
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,780
This is why Yeo Wool agreed to be cast?

437
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,920
I had no idea...

438
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,490
What do I do now? I'm in big trouble! I'm so stupid. I had no idea.

439
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,150
Speak of the devil...

440
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,420
- How did he know? 
  - The shoot is going well, right?

441
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,210
 I look forward to it. Show me the edit on time.

442
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm in big trouble...

443
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,260
Why did Yeol Wool have to confess now of all times?

444
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,150
Should I have just listened to Wang Kyeong Tae?

445
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,940
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

446
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,500
We can't even cast someone else at this point.

447
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,290
No.

448
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,440
That's right. Sincerity. Sincerity...

449
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,300
We shouldn't lie.

450
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,000
If we show everything the way it is, the viewers will appreciate it for sure.

451
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,300
Let's edit this...

452
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,730
K-Ki Ho...

453
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:24,310
K-Ki Ho, are you okay?

454
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:29,000
PD Oh, please edit what happened today.

455
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,510
I was actually thinking about what to do—

456
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,540
Don't think about it and just erase it.

457
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,820
This is more miserable than being slapped on the street...

458
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,630
after confessing your feelings. You saw it, too.

459
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,790
Ki Ho...

460
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:56,430
I completely understand how you feel.

461
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,640
My sincerity was shunned.

462
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,270
But...

463
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,390
But you're going to broadcast that?

464
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,940
Ki Ho, aside from... this being broadcasted,

465
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,100
this is Yeo Wool's sincerity.

466
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,420
All the moments that were recorded today

467
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,790
were your story, but it's Yeo Wool's story, too.

468
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,990
Because of what happened today,

469
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,870
I feel like I'll never be able to love again!

470
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,410
But... you want me to keep this video and keep it forever?

471
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,520
No! I can't do that.

472
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,690
All right. For now...

473
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,470
Ki Ho, calm down for now.

474
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,440
- And— 
 - Erase it.

475
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,450
Ki Ho, did you forget?

476
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:59,530
We agreed not to give up until the end, no matter what happens.

477
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,740
If it were you, do you think you could do that?

478
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,500
Oh! Wait, Ki Ho, you can't!

479
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,890
What are you doing? Give it back!

480
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,820
- Now! You can't! 
 - PD Oh! PD Oh...

481
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,890
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

482
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,230
Just blame it on me. Okay?

483
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,700
- All right? 
 - I said, you can't!

484
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,530
Wait! Wait, Ki Ho! You can't!

485
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,350
You absolutely can't! Ki Ho!

486
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,760
No, no! Ki Ho!

487
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,910
Wait! Ki Ho!

488
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,650
Ki Ho! Open the door. You absolutely mustn't!

489
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,600
Think about it more rationally. Please?

490
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,800
Ki Ho, I'll edit it real nice. Okay?

491
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:42,490
As time passes, you'll forget everything and live your life.

492
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,430
I'll take care of it.

493
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,750
No...

494
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,320
No! No, Ki Ho! Ki Ho!

495
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,540
Wait, Ki Ho! Wait, Ki Ho! Ki Ho! Ki Ho!

496
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,030
Ki Ho, wait!

497
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,700
I'm not in the mood to do this with you.

498
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,150
Look who's talking.

499
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,570
Did you just hit me?

500
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
Yes.

501
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,750
I hit you. So what?

502
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,720
I'm just asking. I'm thinking about hitting you, too.

503
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,090
This is good.

504
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,660
I was in a shitty mood anyway.

505
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,640
I won't just stand back, either.

506
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,780
You cowardly bastard!

507
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,050
You're the coward, you bastard!

508
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,630
Get lost from my life now!

509
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,000
Why interfere when you already have everything!

510
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,680
What bullshit are you saying?

511
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,970
Nothing's working out because of you!

512
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,090
The world is unfair.

513
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,170
Did you have to take everything to feel satisfied?

514
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,620
- What the hell— 
 - You!

515
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,420
What are you doing, bastard?

516
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,320
I can't stand the sight of your face.

517
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,580
Are you crazy?

518
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,200
Yes! Please just disappear!

519
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,220
Don't you know I'm the Wang Kyeong Tae of revenge?

520
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,640
I was going to butt out silently, but you started this.

521
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,880
Don't regret this!

522
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,070
You little...

523
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,280
You could die from humiliation, huh?

524
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,960
It's ticklish. It's ticklish!

525
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,240
Ow! Let go. Let go, now!

526
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,550
Let go! Ow!

527
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,490
What are they doing?

528
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,360
Kyeong Tae! Chae Dong!

529
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,430
There's big trouble! We don't have time for this!

530
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,900
What trouble?

531
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,200
Oh Young Shim has been abducted!

532
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,410
-A-Abducted? 
 - Does that make sense?

533
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,870
That unbelievable thing happened to her right now.

534
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:01,570
Nam Ki Ho abducted her and disappeared!

535
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,460
Where is everyone?

536
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,280
They're all down there. Hurry up! Hurry!

537
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,190
I'm first!

538
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,330
Hurry up!

539
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,140
Where in the world are we?

540
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,450
What the? Come on. Come on!

541
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,970
Shit, it turned off.

542
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,940
Gosh, this is trouble! Seriously!

543
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,800
What's wrong?

544
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,680
Nam Ki Ho got agitated and ran away with the video Senior Young Shim was editing.

545
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,990
- What? 
 - Oh my goodness.

546
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,750
The first episode airs soon, though.

547
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,720
The problem is Senior Young Shim got abducted along with the video file.

548
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,770
What?

549
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,070
T-Then shouldn't we report this?

550
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,590
To the police. The police.

551
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,970
Report...

552
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,350
Not the police.

553
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,100
What's going on here?

554
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,340
No contact from Senior yet, right?

555
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,750
Then report this to the police immediately.

556
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,790
I said we can't!

557
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,950
Why not?

558
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,960
 This is...

559
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,850
 really the last chance I can give you, Oh Young Shim.

560
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,950
 Yes, Chief!

561
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,270
If we delay this, we don't know what will happen to Senior Young Shim.

562
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,560
If we call the police, this will definitely be on the news even before the first episode.

563
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,500
Don't you know how important this program is to Oh Young Shim?

564
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,610
This is driving me nuts.

565
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,610
If something goes awry now,

566
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,750
Oh Young Shim loses her only chance.

567
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,980
We need to be cautious.

568
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,460
Shouldn't we contact Nam Ki Ho's family and persuade or negotiate with him?

569
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,690
No.

570
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,680
Judging by Nam Ki Ho's personality, that can make the situation worse.

571
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,810
Then, you want us to just stand here?

572
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,060
You can't reach Oh Young Shim?

573
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:33,220
After that one text laced with typos, even her phone turned off.

574
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,190
What do we do?

575
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,010
Did something really happen to Oh Young Shim?

576
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,650
Hey, what's gotten into you now?

577
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,060
I'm sure everything is fine.

578
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,350
 A sudden rise in heart rate has been detected.

579
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,320
Was Oh Young Shim wearing... a watch on her wrist?

580
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,730
A watch?

581
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,980
Oh! I saw it.

582
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,640
Oh Young Shim has my watch?

583
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,930
 The watch looks fine.

584
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,270
 Wang Kyeong Tae was being like that for no reason.

585
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,540
 It works. How pretty.

586
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,760
 Please shout S.O.S. if you need rescue.

587
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,570
CEO Wang... doesn't this only ring in emergency situations?

588
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,990
What do we do?

589
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,620
Did something really happen to Oh Young Shim?

590
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,590
What's going on?

591
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:08,880

592
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,110
 Oh Young Shim... where are you right now?

593
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:29,190
♫  What can't be erased doesn't go the way I want  ♫

594
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,760
♫  I keep missing you  ♫

595
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:41,570
♫  You're like an unforgettable dream  ♫

596
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,560
♫  I want to stay by your side  ♫

597
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,680

598
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,000
 Ki Ho! I said to pull over!

599
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,820
 We got further away! What are you doing?

600
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,060
 Hurry up and step on it!

601
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,380
 - Wait! Wait a second!  
  - Let go of me!

602
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,720
 Oh Young Shim!

603
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,150
 Get yourself together!

604
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,470
 Kyeong Tae...

605
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,610
 I know better than anyone, Ki Ho.

606
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,390
 I know better how you feel.

607
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,320
 Ki Ho...

608
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,150
 I know full well what you mean!

609
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,320
 Gosh, Kyeong Tae! I'm so glad!

610
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,570
 I'll continue to be a junior who likes you and looks up to you.

611
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,300
 Thank you, Chae Dong.

612
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,420
 Just sell whatever Aunt Young Shim doesn't use and make some allowance money.

613
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,200
 There's nothing wrong, right?

614
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,200
 He lives in the same neighborhood and follows me around a lot.

615
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,570
 She can dream on.

616
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,870
 You don't want her, but don't want someone else to have her. Right?

617
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:46,450
 I think this can happen to anyone in their youth.

618
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,790
 That never happened to me, though.
