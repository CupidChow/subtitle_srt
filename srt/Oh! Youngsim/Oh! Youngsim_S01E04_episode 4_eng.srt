1
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,930

2
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,630

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,600

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,170

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,550

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,810

7
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,910

8
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,080
We can do both.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,850
Resolving the issue and starting a new show.

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,710
How so?

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,530
We need to break through head-on.

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,430
Also, Kingvely will sponsor the entire production cost for the new show.

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,650
 The entire production cost?

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,880
Not a bad deal for you, right?

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,370
How are you going to break through the controversy?

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,440
I'll apologize honestly for causing a problem with my feelings in the past

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,790
and create a genuine and sincere dating show with PD Oh Young Shim.

18
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:35,040

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,780
You and I?

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,020
We're going to get along... right?

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,500
Oh Young Shim.

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
Yes?

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,610
Did you two come up with this?

24
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,740
Yes.

25
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,640
We'll work it out together.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,550
We'll try.

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,620
Bring me the production proposal first.

28
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,390
Chief Heo... I'm Kingvely.

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,950
I don't trust words.

30
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,680
If you're confident, bring me a proposal that will convince me.

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,390
Hey, you.

32
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:28,110
This is really the last chance I can give you, Oh Young Shim.

33
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,730
Yes, Chief!

34
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll give you 10 days. I can't wait any longer.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,370
Ten days is enough.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,030

37
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,540

38
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,370
Hey, even if we were in a bind, you know nothing about show business. Right?

39
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,400
What, 10 days? How are you going to do it?

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,130
I just need to make it work. It'll work in the end somehow.

41
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,800
Gosh, that's not easy...

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,010
Wait...

43
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,800
Wait a second. Let's put that aside.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,840
You said you're covering the production cost.

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,270
- If you're doing it because you feel bad— 
 - Let's make this clear.

46
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,530
It's not for you. It's for recovering Kingvely's reputation.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,070
Gosh, so you shouldn't have colluded with Wol Sook!

48
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,180
You complicated my life, too!

49
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,080
Now, I know why I wanted to throw you to the ground as soon as I saw you!

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,640
Gosh, your temper is still the same.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Well, wh-who was the one who failed to keep the footage secure and got it leaked?

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,660
A-And you still call yourself a pro?

53
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,050
This is why the chief doesn't trust you, either.

54
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,800
What? What did you just say? What do you know about my life?

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,930
Did I make it up? It's a fact!

56
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,880
You dare to blame someone else in this situation?

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,590
Hey, you're really absurd. Do your employees know this side of you?

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,910
Do they know what a childish loser you are?

59
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,390
- A loser? 
 - Yes, a loser.

60
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,410
You should be called loser-ly, not Kingvely.

61
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,430
Loser-ly?

62
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,970
- Yes, loser-ly. 
 - Loser-ly?

63
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,780
- Yes, loser-ly! 
 - Is that all you got to say?

64
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,110
No, that's not all, you scamming loser!

65
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,580
Is it going well?

66
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,190
It was quite noisy out here.

67
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,570
Yes, we're having a heated discussion.

68
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,350
A discussion?

69
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,670
Yes, that's right. PD Oh is so full of passion... that she's a fruit.

70
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,340
A passion fruit.

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,400
Heated discussions like this are the keys to a good show,

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,530
so please trust us and wait a little bit.

73
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,120
And it looks like Kingvely will be taking the lead.

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,460
PD Oh Young Shim, we're going to get along and do well. Right?

75
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,580
We must get along, CEO Wang.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,980
All right. I'll look forward to it.

77
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,120
You do fear unemployment, huh?

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,050
For you to join forces with a scamming loser like me.

79
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,930
Isn't it the same for Kingvely, then?

80
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,770
So are you going to do it or not?

81
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,370
This is the last offer from Kingvely.

82
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,400
PD Oh Young Shim, are you going to work with me?

83
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,870
It's because of my last pride as a PD. I have no choice.

84
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,110
I'm going to go all-in to restore Kingvely's reputation.

85
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,520
So let's not get emotional or petty and just do our jobs. Okay?

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,800
You worry about yourself, Mark Wang!

87
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,810
Gosh, so strong...

88
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,970
- How many is this? 
 - Three.

89
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,110
Can you see it?

90
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,420
Three!

91
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,580
Bring me an idea in three days.

92
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,950
Three days? Wh-Who do you think you are?

93
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,400
- You think you're the chief or something? 
 - Me?

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,620
I'm your lifeline, the key to PD Oh's survival in the variety show department.

95
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,970
Am I not?

96
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,590
We're supposed to be working on this together!

97
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,080
I'm too busy making money. So...

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,470
I'll be going.

99
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,970
Hey, Wang Kyeong Tae— Wang Kyeong Tae!

100
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,320
Gosh, Wang Kyeong Tae...

101
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
Wait a second. Three days?

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,400
Three days isn't that much time.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,990
Let's hurry!

104
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,370
 Youngim, it's dangerous!

105
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,720
 Please help!

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,470
-  Youngsim!  
  - Please save Youngsim first!

107
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,340
They had a history like this?

108
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,800
Wait! He liked Senior this much?

109
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,770
 Youngsim, wake up. You can't die!

110
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,180
Just how much of it is the truth, and how much is made up?

111
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,220
 Just like I learned in my class...

112
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,360
It's an unexpected appearance of a strong rival, seriously.

113
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,270
 If we're talking about startups, how about this person?

114
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,130
 It's Kingvely, an on-the-rise unicorn startup.

115
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,820
 They made a lot of money through fashion e-commerce

116
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,010
 and their CEO just arrived in Seoul.

117
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,000
Why did I mention Kingvely back then?

118
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,520
I axed my own foot.

119
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,430
I'm going to die at this rate.

120
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,240
No!

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,450
You can't die like this, Oh Young Shim.

122
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,780
You can't die. Wake up.

123
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,480
Come on! Come on!

124
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,700
Wake up! Wake up!

125
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,810
You can do it!

126
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,780
You can't die, Oh Young Shim.

127
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,680
This kind of twist can only happen in a cartoon.

128
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,800
Geez, this pen is too old now.

129
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,000
Goodness, my hand hurts, too.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,420
I guess I can't draw more.

131
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,760
Let me get that.

132
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,370
Is it that heavy?

133
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,760
No.

134
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,380
Not at all. It's your love and devotion.

135
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,280
I'll make sure to take care of Senior Young Shim.

136
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,780
Gosh, our PD Lee speaks so nicely!

137
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,620
I even added the fried fish cakes you like.

138
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,080
Oh, really? Thank you!

139
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,340
I really like fried fish cakes.

140
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,170
Father, hello.

141
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,800
F-Father...

142
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,450
How am I your father?

143
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,030
You told me to call you that last time...

144
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,140
Did I ever say that to you?

145
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,960
Oh, gosh. Dad, what's gotten into you?

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,290
It's late, so don't worry and just go.

147
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,810
Okay, I'll get going then.

148
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,660
Thank you.

149
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,260
What's with you? Get back inside!

150
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,300
- How about Son-in-law Wang? 
 - That's enough!

151
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,410
Seriously.

152
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,610
Wait, Dad. Why are you suddenly treating Chae Dong like that?

153
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,820
Kyeong Tae is here now.

154
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,610
Kyeong Tae is a better fit for Young Shim.

155
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,400
Even so, you can't do that! My gosh!

156
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,140
Hey, just forget it.

157
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,810
What's Young Shim doing these days that she's not even coming home?

158
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,550
Young Shim seemed too busy with making a new show.

159
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,360
She said she might have to resign because of a problem, but did that get resolved?

160
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
She said she needed to work hard now to resolve that problem.

161
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,040
With Kyeong Tae— I mean, Mark.

162
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,610
Wait!  What do you mean?

163
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,120
She's trying to get with Kyeong Tae?

164
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,240
It's not that!

165
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,070
I heard Oh Young Shim and Kyeong Tae are making a dating show or something together.

166
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,160
A dating show? My goodness!

167
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,470
I'm so glad to hear that!

168
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,650
What are you so glad about, Dad?

169
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,080
He embarrassed her with zero votes in front of the entire nation.

170
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,570
And you saw him getting thrown to the ground for doing that?

171
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,350
You're glad? Are you really?

172
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,010
Those two are meant to be.

173
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,380
I'm not sure.

174
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,850
I'm honestly really worried.

175
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,170
Mark is rumored to be petty at our company.

176
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,170
So what? A man only needs to be competent.

177
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,350
That's right!

178
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,250
Competency is what a man needs!

179
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,010
I mean, from what I saw today...

180
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,420
a cute and affectionate type like Chae Dong is

181
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,580
also a really good fit for Young Shim.

182
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,170
Wait, but Chae Dong seemed pretty sane.

183
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,620
Unless he's insane, why would he date Young Shim?

184
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,990
And what's wrong with Young Shim?

185
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,060
Well, that's not what I meant.

186
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,590
- Kyeong Tae is suitable for Young Shim. 
 - Gosh...

187
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,220
I think a guy like Chae Dong is really fine, too.

188
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,520
Young Shim is the best fit for Kyeong Tae.

189
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,890
Chae Dong, Dad.

190
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,380
Could I borrow some money for the bus?

191
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,250
Excuse me...

192
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,710
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I lost my wallet...

193
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,970
Could I borrow some money for the bus?

194
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,050
 Excuse me. I lost my wallet on my way to an interview.

195
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,540
  I borrow some money for the bus?

196
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,990
 - Sorry— 
 - I'll pay you right after I'm done!

197
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,450
 No, no. I'm sorry.

198
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,180
  me. I lost my wallet on my way to an interview—

199
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,490
 Excuse me. I'm sorry but I lost my wallet—

200
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,610
 Excuse me!

201
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,790
 I'll lend you some money.

202
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,140
 How much do you need?

203
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,680
 Hold on, please.

204
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,180
 I'm late for my interview.

205
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,190
 I'll pay you back as soon as I'm done.

206
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,690
 You can take your time.

207
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,840
 Actually, you don't need to pay me back. I won't hunt you down.

208
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,700
 I-I need to pay you back. I'll really pay you back.

209
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,760
 Thank you.

210
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,950
 Wait a minute!

211
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,120
 A person's first impression is really important.

212
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,850

213
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,310
 I heard it's really hard to get a job nowadays.

214
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,390
 I really hope you'll make it.

215
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,160
 Also, if the interviewers pressure you or harass you...

216
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,770
 just think a crazy dog in your neighborhood is barking and

217
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,070
 say everything you want to say.

218
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,680
 Don't be intimidated.

219
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,530
 Fighting!

220
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,930
 Let's go!

221
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,010
I'm sure... she had cried that day after getting her show canceled.

222
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,950
Senior always moves my heart unexpectedly.

223
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,100
I'll bring it to her before it gets cold.

224
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:37,320

225
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,530
She's working really hard.

226
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,400
Did you stop by my house?

227
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,300
Yes! Gosh. What a good nose.

228
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,290
Senior, please eat slowly, for goodness' sake!

229
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,490
There's no time. I need to stuff myself and rewrite the proposal.

230
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
Who knew I'd end up doing two dating shows?

231
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,010
These days, there are too many similar shows.

232
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,510
So I'm not sure how to make mine stand out.

233
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,370
Take it easy.

234
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,040
We're all doing this to make a living.

235
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,980
I really want to do it properly this time.

236
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,190
- Senior... 
 - Yes?

237
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,990
Must we work with that guy Wang Kyeong Tae?

238
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,900
Yes, we have to.

239
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,420
In fact, the thing is...

240
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,950
I wouldn't even have had this chance if Wang Kyeong Tae wasn't there.

241
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,910
Hey, I'm sorry. I order you around too much, don't I?

242
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,540
No, that's not it.

243
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,870
Actually, there's something I'm really curious about.

244
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,440
Between you and that Wang Kyeong Tae... what relationship in the past—

245
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,230
Hey, what's this delicious smell?

246
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,360
Awesome! Awesome! I'm starving.

247
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,050
Hey, take a seat. Eat.

248
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,780
- Hey, give them some plates, please. 
 - Oh, okay.

249
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,440
It's really delicious. I can't do much for you guys, but I'll make sure you eat well.

250
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,400
- It's really delicious. 
 - Thank you.

251
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,530
Did you know this? Even MBTIs have pairs for dating.

252
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,560
- Really? 
 - Yes.

253
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,680
What's your MBTI?

254
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,580
Me? Was it ISTJ?

255
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,840
What? Why?

256
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,620
 I'm home!

257
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,480
How long has it been since I was in bed?

258
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,310
Why are you working so hard?

259
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,260
Do you really have that much work?

260
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,440
My goodness, my goodness.

261
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,930
Who knew I'd be doing a show with Wang Kyeong Tae on my back?

262
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,510
You really don't know what will happen in life.

263
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,950
I just can't let my guard down.

264
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,250
That's true.

265
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,510
Who knew Kyeong Tae would become my boss?

266
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,390
Anyhow... what do you plan to do from now?

267
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,150
For now, I plan to at least feign death

268
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,810
if he tells me to die until the show comes to an end.

269
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,160
Why would you go that far?

270
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,230
Can't you just not do it?

271
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,460
I feel like I really won't be able to do anything...

272
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,650
if I keep lashing out in anger like that.

273
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,740
This time,

274
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,360
I'll endure it and breakthrough, even if it makes my guts twist.

275
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,380
You matured so suddenly.

276
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,830
So awkward.

277
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,180
I also want to break through the uneasy feeling with Wang Kyeong Tae...

278
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,470
from 20 years ago and...

279
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,950
Just avoiding him doesn't seem to be the answer.

280
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,330
By the way, Sis...

281
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,970
Kyeong Tae oppa coming back after 20 years...

282
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,610
Is it really a coincidence?

283
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,580
Doesn't seeing Kyeong Tae make you feel a certain way?

284
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,840
Gosh, I decided to stop thinking and just accept it for now.

285
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,460
That makes things simple for me.

286
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,250
I'll burn everything as fuel this time, my pride and stamina.

287
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,400
That's Oh Young Shim for you...

288
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,980
You have no thoughts, just like your name. 
  ("Young" sounds like zero, "Shim" means heart or mind)

289
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,460
Yes, because he's still Wang Kyeong Tae and I'm Oh Young Shim.

290
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,410
Since things started this way, I'm not backing out, either.

291
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,050

292
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,320
Hello.

293
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
Geez, let us pass.

294
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,510
Why is she blocking our way?

295
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,780
My goodness.

296
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,100
Come in, come in.

297
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,440
Just undergoing construction.

298
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,340
You live alone in this huge house?

299
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, I'll reside here during my stay in Korea.

300
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,460
Whoa. You've really succeeded.

301
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,380
- Have a seat there. 
 - Huh? Oh, okay.

302
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,160
That's that...

303
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,020
You brought me a good idea, right?

304
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,190
I have a general outline,

305
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,880
but I need more time to find a special "wow" factor.

306
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,190
We don't have time, though.

307
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:24,350
PD Oh Young Shim, what do you think the key point of a dating program is?

308
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,720
Key point?

309
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,680
You personally participated in one, so think about it from the other side.

310
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,560
Key point...

311
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,950
Wouldn't the key point be to read the other person's feelings first?

312
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,330
If I can find out who likes me and what they're feeling,

313
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,190
I think the possibility of failing in love will decrease as well.

314
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,200
And I wouldn't have to speculate or...

315
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,050
delude myself, either. Right?

316
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,340
Wouldn't that be the fun of it?

317
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,580
If you know everything,

318
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,600
- it's no fun. 
 - I guess...

319
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,790
That's true.

320
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:24,140
Even if it's a program, feelings can't lie.

321
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,940
Unless you're intentionally trying to fool someone,

322
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,800
the more honest you are, the better.

323
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,970
Then you can approach each other without hesitating.

324
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:46,370
How purely honest do you think... a person can be?

325
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,380
Then should we test it out right now?

326
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,560
How honest we can be?

327
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,930
I'm curious about something.

328
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,080
Why did you decide to join our program this time?

329
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,990
I also have a question.

330
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,110
Why did you choose me... for the final selection?

331
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,600
That's...

332
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,440
Because of what you said—

333
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,070
Whoa! Watch out!

334
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,860
Oh, what in the world?

335
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,940
Gosh, our Young Shim!

336
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,960
Oh, no! Our poor Young Shim!

337
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,440
That's not her, right?

338
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,420
That can't be her.

339
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,410
I can't let her go like this!

340
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,600
- Goodness! 
 - Oh, Father! Father!

341
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,930
I couldn't even do anything for her.

342
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,810
- No, no. 
 - Young Shim!

343
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,110
We should at least check her face.

344
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,400
Hold on. Excuse me!

345
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,390
I'm looking for Oh Young Shim.

346
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,220
She has a pale face and looks tacky. Do you know where she went?

347
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,990
- Ms. Oh Young Shim? 
 - Yes, yes.

348
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,080
You can go to the outpatient clinic.

349
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,930
O-Outpatient?

350
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,580
O-Outpatient...

351
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,420
Anyway, this way. Right?

352
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Let's go!

353
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,360
Oh dear! Young Shim!

354
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,900
Ms. Oh Young Shim, you have slight bruising on your waist and knees.

355
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,780
Mr. Wang Kyeong Tae, you have a slight concussion, but...

356
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,290
 A concussion?

357
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,720
But it's not severe enough to be admitted.

358
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,650
But just to be safe, you need absolute rest.

359
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,180
As his guardian, you should keep a good eye on him.

360
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,380
Guardian... sure.

361
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,720
If there's a problem, consult the outpatient clinic.

362
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,380
You can return home today.

363
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,070
Doctor, you're sure I'm fine. Right?

364
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,930
H-His nose is bleeding. Is that okay?

365
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,240
- Yes, it's just a side effect. 
 - He's fine, so why is bleeding?

366
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,000
- Please call my mom. 
 - No, no...

367
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,820
Thank you.

368
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,980
Blood!

369
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,700
Where? Where is it?

370
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,180
Young Shim... Young Shim!

371
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,660
There she is!

372
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,930
- Young Shim! 
 - Are you okay?

373
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,000
Goodness, Young Shim!

374
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,500
- Goodness! 
 - Are you hurt?

375
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
What's this?

376
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,550
Are you hurt anywhere?

377
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,300
I'm fine, I'm fine. This is a hospital, so be quiet.

378
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,480
All right, all right.

379
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,920
But why does Kyeong Tae look worse?

380
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,740
Oh, Kyeong Tae has a slight concussion. But he's fine.

381
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,980
Concussion?

382
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,190
Father! Father!

383
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,460
Hey, hey. Shouldn't he be admitted for a concussion?

384
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,180
He's fine. He just needs some care.

385
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,290
Gosh, he even has a nosebleed.

386
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,460
He doesn't look fine.

387
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,460
No worries. He bled a while ago. It's okay.

388
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,800

389
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,190
Just come with us.

390
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,180
You can't go home and no one to take care of you.

391
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,440
I'm really fine. I can stay at a hotel.

392
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,550
It's slight, but you still have a concussion.

393
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,010
What if you suddenly go into shock from hemorrhaging?

394
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,140
He says he's fine.

395
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,860
How could we send him off alone when he's this hurt and has nowhere to go?

396
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,450
A house does sound better than a hotel.

397
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,000
Fine, the doctor said to keep an eye on him,

398
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,550
so do whatever's comfortable for you.

399
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,850
Of course, a house is more comfortable.

400
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,950
Hey, just come home with us.

401
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,330
Yeah, come with us.

402
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,030
- I'm really fine— 
 - Hey!

403
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,480
Fine, my foot! We need to help each other in times of hardship.

404
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Are we strangers or something?

405
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,030
And you used to always come over and stay a couple of nights when you were young.

406
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,780
What's wrong with all of you? He says he's fine.

407
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,670
He said he didn't want to. Let's leave him be.

408
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,590
It's not because I don't want to.

409
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,640
Kyeong Tae, if it's not that,

410
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,680
then declining anymore when an adult is offering help is being discourteous.

411
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,400
Dad, what's wrong with you?

412
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:35,820
Then I'll be indebted to you for a short while.

413
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,400
Yes, good thinking.

414
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes! You made the right decision.

415
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,780
Anyhow, what in the world happened?

416
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,010
How did your wall collapse?

417
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,660
The house was undergoing remodeling, and there must've been a problem.

418
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,710
Thank goodness you got away with just this.

419
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,460
But how did you end up hurting your head?

420
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,920
I don't really remember...

421
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,190
I was with Young Shim for sure...

422
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,740
 Why did you choose me... during the final selection?

423
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,080
 That's...

424
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,230
 Because of what you said—

425
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,350
 Whoa, watch out!

426
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,990
 Kyeong Tae!

427
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,070
As expected, Oh Young Shim, you're resistant to crisis.

428
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,270
You usually work out so hard.

429
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,550
CEO Wang, you're indebted to Sis now.

430
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,830
My reflexes happened to be quite good.

431
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,350
But such a nice penthouse is unexpectedly weak.

432
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,760
That huge bookcase just collapsed from some construction?

433
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,080
The more perfect something looks, the more cracks there are.

434
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,450
Use this room for now.

435
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,070
It's a bit empty since it's my office, but it's pretty clean.

436
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,180
I love it.

437
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,470
Wear these as pajamas.

438
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,580
They're a set I really treasure.

439
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,460
Thank you, Hyungnim.

440
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,930
Woo Sang, Kyeong Tae needs rest, so let's leave.

441
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,840
- Okay. 
 - Rest. Let's go.

442
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,900
I hope you like the pajamas.

443
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,190
They still use blankets like this?

444
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,350
I'm uncomfortable... and uncomfortable.

445
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,680

446
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,250
Why isn't she picking up?

447
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,570
Is everything okay?

448
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,090
It's Chae Dong!

449
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,420
Welcome, Chae Dong.

450
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,110
- Hello, Noonim. 
 - Hey.

451
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,700
Where's Young Shim?

452
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,390
Oh, Young Shim's on the second floor.

453
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,020
Why is he here?

454
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,910
Oh, he's staying at our house for now due to personal circumstances.

455
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,190
I'm very grateful to you.

456
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,810
For treating me like family.

457
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,740
I'll never forget this kindness.

458
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,300
Aren't you leaving?

459
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,030
Are you going to keep standing there?

460
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,580
Noonim, could I eat before I go?

461
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,630
Of course, you can.

462
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,550
What does our Chae Dong want to eat?

463
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,430
 "Our Chae Dong"?

464
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:30,770
Chae Dong wants your delicious pork ribs.

465
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,870
Of course, you can!

466
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,890
Of course, you can have pork ribs.

467
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,470
I can, right?

468
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,980
- Wait a bit. 
 - Thank you.

469
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,650
Eat up, everyone.

470
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,290
- All right. 
 - Thank you for the food.

471
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,780
Look at the color of the meat.

472
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,430
The sauce on this meat is incredible!

473
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,250
I thought you were on a diet.

474
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,640
Patients should eat at least this much for a swift recovery.

475
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,000
And this protein... whoa.

476
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,580
It's amazing.

477
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,590
Noonim, this is really good!

478
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,920
This is better than my mom's! Honestly!

479
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,910
Our Chae Dong eats so heartily.

480
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,420
It's because it's so delicious.

481
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,980
Whoa... how much better would it taste with lettuce?

482
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,590
This lettuce is organic, isn't it?

483
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,240
This is totally organic!

484
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,700
- Here, Senior. 
  - You can't forget the dumplings.

485
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,150
Is it polite to stay over this long?

486
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,700
Aren't you being a nuisance?

487
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,010
I have things to discuss with Senior.

488
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,000
So it's fine.

489
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,230
Let's talk about work at work.

490
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,060
Don't add to the frenzy here, and just leave for today.

491
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,790
Yeah. Come back soon.

492
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,990
How could this happen in just one day?

493
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,060
Wang Kyeong Tae isn't your average man.

494
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,440
Huh?

495
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,290
Ji Yoo!

496
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,290
Hello.

497
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,950
Hi!

498
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,350
Gosh. It must be hard studying, huh?

499
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,940
Did you eat yet?

500
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,920
Yes, I ate near the academy.

501
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,870
Oh, good job.

502
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,820
Next time, I'll buy you something delicious on the weekend.

503
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,140
Promise.

504
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,770
Sure.

505
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,100
Get home safely.

506
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,130
Goodbye—

507
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,170
Oh, wait! Ji Yoo.

508
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:37,800
Ji Yoo, could I... ask you a favor?

509
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,400
Gosh, I think I ate too much.

510
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
How long has it been since I ate this much?

511
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,980
This place hasn't changed a single bit.

512
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,520
Can I digest all this?

513
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,760
It's not digesting.

514
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,960
He should've contacted me by now.

515
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,880
Is Wang Kyeong Tae that busy?

516
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,200
He can't not reach out to me, the star of the controversy.

517
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,460

518
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,850
There's no way this is possible.

519
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,010
Should I contact him first?

520
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,350

521
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,890
No. No, no.

522
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,090
Wait, Goo Wol Sook. Maintain your pride.

523
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,690
Wol Sook, what should we use for next month's content?

524
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,510
We've exhausted all our content. Right?

525
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,570
Yes, for most dating topics, we used it double and even triple times.

526
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,540
I have a totally great idea.

527
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,510
What if I cast Kingvely?

528
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,280
That would be a big hit!

529
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,020
You're going to cast him personally?

530
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,630
Do you still keep in touch with him?

531
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,330
O-Of course!

532
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,770
Then I'll leave it to you.

533
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,410
Would Oh Young Shim know what Kingvely's up to these days?

534
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,410
Man, I'm thirsty.

535
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,980
How refreshing.

536
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,540
 You know it's D-3, right?

537
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,650
 Did you complete the proposal?

538
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,990
 How far along are you?

539
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,630
 Did you review all the references?

540
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,810
As if I didn't know he was a CEO.

541
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,340
He's really rushing me.

542
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,980
 Make sure Kingvely's logo is placed clearly and long-lasting.

543
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,420
I'm working on it.

544
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,850
Selfish prick.

545
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,580
He's making me do everything.

546
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,790

547
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,010
Goo Wol Sook?

548
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,230
What the?

549
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,580
Geez, should I pick up or not?

550
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,990
Hello?

551
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,490
What took you so long?

552
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,080
Goo Wol Sook,

553
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,470
if you're calling to apologize because you feel bad—

554
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,100
What's there to feel bad about the affairs of a man and a woman? So childish!

555
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,730
I almost got fired from work because of you two!

556
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,020
Don't you know the number of hits Love Lines clips received more than doubled after?

557
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,540
Gossip about popularity is completely natural.

558
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,410
Just like me, Goo Wol Sook.

559
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,960
You or Wang Kyeong Tae only think about teasing me, don't you?

560
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,920
I'm busy.

561
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,950
Oh, my! I called to ask about Kyeong Tae.

562
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,890
Do you know what Kyeong Tae's up to these days?

563
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,530
You two aren't conspiring under my nose again, are you?

564
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,410
What are you talking about?

565
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,320
 Wang Kyeong Tae you're looking for so desperately is at my house.

566
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,420
Wang Kyeong Tae is?

567
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,540
Why in the world is he there? Since when?

568
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,980
 Why is he at your house?

569
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:04,100
If you want to take Wang Kyeong Tae, I more than welcome it.

570
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,570
Is no one home?

571
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,520
Man, it's hot.

572
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,310
Gosh, this hurts my pride, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

573
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,240
No, I can do much worse than this!

574
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,860
Love is something you attain.

575
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,560
Huh? Chae Dong, what brings you here?

576
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,790
Hello.

577
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,000
What brings you here, Wol Sook?

578
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,620
There's something I need to call dibs on.

579
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,980
Anyway, what brings you to your colleague's house at this hour?

580
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:22,730
Oh, I also have something to deliver to Senior, so I stopped by.

581
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:26,180
What do you need to deliver? I'll give it to her.

582
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,570
By chance, is it love?

583
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,130
You'll wake everyone up.

584
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,680
Did you say you're PD Chae Dong?

585
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,570
Mr. PD, are you aware your gaze and my gaze are the same right now?

586
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:55,350
In my opinion, we wish for the same thing.

587
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,470
Do you want to... form an alliance with me?

588
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,230
I can probably be of great help to you.

589
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,810
Why are you doing this?

590
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,320
Why are you scared?

591
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,420
Why is it so hot today?

592
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,300
- Soon Shim, did you bring the bath bomb? 
 - What the?

593
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,830
Agh! What the?

594
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,980

595
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,510
♫  You've done great so far  ♫

596
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,860
♫  I'll carry the burden on your shoulders with you from now  ♫

597
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,100
 Oh! Youngsim]

598
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
 There definitely is.

599
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,960
 You can't fool my instincts.

600
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,920
 CEO Wang, when will you leave Senior Young Shim's house?

601
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,600
 What does that have to do with you, PD Lee?

602
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,150
 If you can't leave, I was going to drag you out myself!

603
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,800
 Hold on. Let's go to a workshop.

604
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,400
 I guess it's nice being here after all this time.

605
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,510
 We'll begin the game!

606
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,050
 Woot!

607
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,510
 Chae Dong! Flip him over!

608
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,960
 Senior, it's almost over.

609
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,090
 Staycation! Staycation!

610
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,400
 Why did you suddenly disappear without a word?
