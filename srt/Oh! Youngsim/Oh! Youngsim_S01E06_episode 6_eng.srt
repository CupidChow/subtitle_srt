1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,030

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,610

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,500

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,970

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,550

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,820
 [Jo Yoo Ha: Young Shim's niece, Ji Yoo / Tony Ahn: Young Sjim's brother-in-law, Lee Woo Sang / Wang Ji Hye: Young Shi

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,200

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,100

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,400
Gosh, what are you stalling for?

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,280
"The person I like is currently here. Yes or no?"

11
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:11,950

12
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,400
Gosh, what the heck?

13
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,370
Is something wrong?

14
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,480
I have no idea.

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,280
CEO Wang, you're the best for an ending.

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,820
Stimulating people's imaginations and all. It's so nice to see, right?

17
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,520
We're moving on to the next game, then.

18
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,940
Senior, it's your turn.

19
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,760
Huh? O-Oh, okay.

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,140
I think I'll go for this one.

21
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,680
"When was your last skinship?"

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
"Whether you don't answer or you've got none, you get punished."

23
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,950
Seriously.

24
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,830
What's up with the questions?

25
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,500
Who brought this?

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,460
Hey, this much is child's play.

27
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,680
If it was too long ago for you to remember, just drink.

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,770
Everybody has to chug their shots, though!

29
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,390
I think I'm ready to puke, though!

30
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,230
I don't think I can drink, either.

31
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,170
PD Oh, I feel like dying, too.

32
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,830
Isn't the punishment too harsh?

33
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,830
You can just answer, then. It's simple.

34
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,230
What are the standards of skinship, then?

35
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,280
Hey, why ask what even toddlers know these days?

36
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,660
Progress and touch between opposite sex.

37
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
I need a man near me for that to happen.

38
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,000
No matter how I think about it, there's none that's recent.

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,940
Just because he's a male doesn't mean he's a man to me.

40
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,950
I'm sorry, everyone.

41
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,390
That doesn't count as skinship?

42
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,830
What's wrong, Wang Kyeong Tae?

43
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,990
We were clearly naked and saw everything there was to see!

44
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,050
What does he mean naked?

45
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,790
What's he saying right now?

46
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,760
Something did happen.

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,700
Did something happen between them?

48
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,200
Wait— Hey!

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,590
Y-You're drunk. Sit down now!

50
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,850
Shut up, please!

51
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,960
Gosh, let go.

52
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,480
Senior, what's he saying? He's wrong, right?

53
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,410
No way. Something really happened that night?

54
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,620
N-No, that's not it. Th-That's not what he's talking about.

55
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,580
It was just an accident and a mistake that day.

56
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,800
- An accident? 
 - I guess an accident did happen.

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,490
An accident?

58
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,850
Wait, everyone. It's absolutely not what you're thinking.

59
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,530
- We were naked, but— 
 - What?

60
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,590
- So you were both naked, huh? 
 - Huh?

61
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,360
Senior, that's the kind of person you were?

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,470
N-No, I'm not.

63
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,170
Hey, Wang Kyeong Tae, everyone's getting the wrong idea.

64
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,970
Hurry up and say they have it wrong!

65
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,360
You go ahead and talk. Come on.

66
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,160
I mean...

67
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,050
Jang Hwan...

68
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,230
Jang Hwan, what's wrong?

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,890
Hyung, is something wrong?

70
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,570
I was rejected yet again.

71
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,890
The girl you were catching feels for recently?

72
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,010
I met her five freaking times!

73
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,240
The mood was nice and all, too.

74
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,690
You liked her a lot, Hyung.

75
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,710
What's the matter, then?

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,140
She said I'm just boring.

77
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,370
Jang Hwan, you can't even drink that much. Stop it here.

78
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,080
Stop drinking, okay?

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,130
Had I gone on a date as planned over the weekend,

80
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,520
instead of coming to a workshop, this wouldn't have happened.

81
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,820
What dating show am I here to make when I can't even date myself?

82
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,130
Senior...

83
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,710
Yes?

84
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,390
I'll just go back to Seoul now.

85
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,530
I think I should try holding onto her now.

86
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,570
No, you shouldn't.

87
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,130
F-For now, calm down a bit—

88
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,520
Dating and show business, I quit!

89
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,770
CEO Wang, p-please be careful.

90
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,890
How pathetic, seriously.

91
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,820
Wang Kyeong Tae, cut it out.

92
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,800
What did you say?

93
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,910
Pathetic, am I?

94
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,930
If you're rich and successful,

95
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,550
are you allowed to say whatever you want? Huh?

96
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,420
There's no worse of an eyesore...

97
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,590
than a man who got rejected by a woman, he clung to out of loneliness.

98
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,240
You don't have anyone to tell you this, either.

99
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,100
Do you wish to remain such a pathetic human being all your life?

100
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,630
I wanted to really give it my all this time.

101
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,550
You don't even know...

102
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,930
Just let me see.

103
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,280
Let you see what?

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,720
Your cellphone!

105
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,950
Don't you want to find out why you were rejected?

106
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,740
Are you saying you can find out, CEO Wang?

107
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Just hurry up and let me see your messages.

108
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,710
Open your messages.

109
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,940

110
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,520

It's worse than I expected, seriously.

111
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,010
You're the only one talking here.

112
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,240
Wait, but what did Jang Hwan do wrong?

113
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,050
Could it be that the woman was too busy to answer in time?

114
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,790
PD Jang Hwan was the only one involved, wasn't he?

115
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,310
Did he send messages all excited by himself...

116
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,740
that don't allow the other person to say much?

117
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,730
Wait, how much more can he express himself?

118
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,790
Jang Hwan expressed a lot of his feelings.

119
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,700
Don't talk from a man's perspective.

120
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,740
This is a type of "give me more" technique.

121
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,360
She's not really sore about losing Jang Hwan...

122
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,860
and she's just trying to see how badly he wants her.

123
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,080
What?

124
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,620
Doesn't that make her a terrible person?

125
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,100
In fact, I had a similar experience before.

126
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,610
I'm almost 100% sure she has someone else in mind.

127
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,720
Therefore,

128
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,340
it means you were played, sort of speak.

129
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,420
Wh-What could I have done wrong?

130
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,390
Jang Hwan... messages aren't for your diaries.

131
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,970
Writing so much to a response-less thread is the worst.

132
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,850
Isn't he doing that because he likes her?

133
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,420
Our Jang Hwan doesn't play games with people's feelings.

134
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,370
He's a really nice and diligent guy!

135
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,490
But enough is enough.

136
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,550
How can you keep it just enough when you like someone?

137
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,700
What do you think is the gist of his one month's worth of messages?

138
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,510
All right. I get that he's a good person.

139
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,540
However, he's not that attractive as a man.

140
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,510
- Okay? 
 - Shit...

141
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,240
Jang Hwan, I think sincerity is important.

142
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,100
You can't miss the timing. Her heart might close even more.

143
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,840
Geez, look how ignorant she is.

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,010
You'll lose every time if you shove in your sincerity without analyzing the other person.

145
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,020
Hurry up and go, Jang Hwan.

146
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,450
Chae Dong!

147
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,130
You think that will change her mind?

148
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,690
Wh-What are you telling me to do, then?

149
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,960
Jang Hwan, let's admit it.

150
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,740
You were rejected and your flirting is not good enough for a girl.

151
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,000
What you need for a fuzzy and fading flirty romance, is one shot of Oriental medicine to revive the tension.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,940
What if he loses even the remaining one percent of possibility?

153
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,170
How can you guarantee it?

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,030
Does the Zero Votes Girl get a say in this?

155
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,040
Well, then...

156
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,970
shall we make a bet to see who's right?

157
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,730
Jang Hwan, don't you want to know?

158
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,630
The reason why your flirting always fails.

159
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,060
Jang Hwan, make your decision.

160
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,890

161
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,370
 All right, everyone got some good rest? Right?

162
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,190
I'm sure no one's tired.

163
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,270
Stop yawning, all of you.

164
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,230
Let's focus on the meeting again now.

165
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,530
We'll be doing a new version today, so focus.

166
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,380
CEO Wang! CEO Wang! CEO Wang!

167
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,460
It worked! It worked! It worked!

168
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,620
I got a reply! I did!

169
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,960
I got the reply, and we're going to a concert!

170
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,690
What's wrong with you? You're being gross!

171
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,160
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just too happy.

172
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,210
Whoa! She replied. She did!

173
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,050
She replied!

174
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,190
Are you sure? Did you get a reply?

175
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,620
Yes!

176
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,390
Amazing.

177
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,620
What did you do?

178
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,180
 CEO Wang, why did you want to see me here?

179
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,450
 I was worried you might contact her first after drowning in your emotions.

180
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,250
 Geez, what a needless worry.

181
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,700
 I'm going to do nothing like the good-for-nothing I am.

182
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,370
 I didn't tell you to do nothing.

183
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,430
 These are concert tickets.

184
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,130
 I noticed from the lady's feed that she likes music so much that

185
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,120
 she even takes days off to take trips for concerts.

186
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,600
 Wow!

187
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 Aren't these really hard to get?

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,830
 I'm Kingvely, man.

189
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,410
 First off, meeting offline is important, not through messages.

190
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,760
 However... everything after this point is entirely up to you.

191
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,300
 I'm getting nervous.

192
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,260
 Talk less about yourself and ask more about her in a conversation.

193
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,110
 I just wanted to appeal to her as much as I could.

194
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,590
 You have to let the other person talk more about herself than now.

195
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,800
 That's why I asked a lot of questions, too.

196
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,660
 Just asking a lot of questions won't work.

197
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,430
 Open, open. Ask some open questions, please.

198
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,500
 Open questions?

199
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,190
 Right now, you ask closed questions that only call for short answers.

200
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,670
 You need to allow the other person to talk more freely than now.

201
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,050
 Well, for example?

202
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,160
 It's not difficult.

203
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,810
 For example... "What's in your playlist these days? Please recommend."

204
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,100
 Stuff like that.

205
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,470
 Music...

206
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,190
 Therefore, when someone gets to talk more about herself naturally and smoothly...

207
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,370
 the part of the brain that feels happiness gets activated.

208
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,930
 It's the same part that activates when you eat delicious food or earn a lot of money.

209
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,530
 Because people feel great satisfaction and joy

210
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,070
 when they're talking about their strengths and values.

211
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,880
 I asked random things to keep the conversation going.

212
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,440
 But I shouldn't do that, huh?

213
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,040
 All right. Let's go into practice right away.

214
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,350
 Imagine that I'm the woman and ask questions comfortably.

215
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,050
 One second.

216
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,420
 What music do you listen to these days?

217
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,130
 Well, these days...

218
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,530
 I'm listening to Brit pops like Oasis, Blur, and Suede again.

219
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,750
 Do you know about Brit pops by chance?

220
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,010
 Well... not really...

221
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,110
 This is why I said everything is entirely up to you going forward.

222
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:09,800
 If you study the other person's interests with all your heart, not skills,

223
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,830
 I'm sure things will change.

224
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,520
It's our own little secret.

225
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,020
CEO Wang, this is all thanks to you.

226
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,070
I told you I'll make you 100% satisfied with your job. Right?

227
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,050
Just trust me. It all works out.

228
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,470
Seriously, I'm too skilled.

229
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,760
Yes! I won't quit and do my best!

230
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,220
- Sure. 
 - Please order me as you wish...

231
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,390
Brother Kyeong Tae.

232
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,490
Brother?

233
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,040
Hyung! How can you call him your brother?

234
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,790
Kingvely. Kingvely...

235
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,310
Kingvely...

236
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,330
CEO Wang, there's a person I've only been talking to for 10 months...

237
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,960
Ten months?

238
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,180
I confessed because he said he likes go-getters, but I got ghosted.

239
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,420
CEO Wang, I also have a blind date this weekend!

240
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,610
- Blind date? 
 - Hyung, you've got me. Sit back down.

241
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,290
- Sit— 
 - Wait! Wait a minute!

242
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,080
All right, everyone. Attention, please. One moment.

243
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,740
What the heck is going on right now?

244
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,710
Wait a second...

245
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,400
 Though I didn't want to admit it...

246
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,200
 at this moment, I got inspiration I couldn't avoid...

247
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,160
 as a PD.

248
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,180
♫  I want to hear you  ♫

249
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,060
Yes!

250
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,440
This is the answer!

251
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,860
♫  And I want to meet you  ♫

252
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,010
Done.

253
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,390
What about that person in the middle? Did he say he'll come out?

254
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,320
- One, two, three! Fighting! 
  - Fighting!

255
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,370
♫  Youngsim  ♫

256
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
 We'll start pitching now.

257
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,030
"Love Mark!"

258
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,660
"Love Mark."

259
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,270
You'll mark... love?

260
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,680
There's Dr. Oh Eun Young for parenting...

261
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,050
and there's Oh Young Shim for dating.

262
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,870
I'm getting worried again.

263
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,760
Th-There has never been a dating show like this one.

264
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,220
Is this reality or a variety show?

265
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,660
Young Shim and Kyeong Tae in your memories...

266
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,930
now desperately want to move on to dating from flirting.

267
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,880
To help young people of Korea with the perils of flirting,

268
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,890
we "Mark" them and observe them closely!

269
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,780
We're not exactly "Bridging Them Across Dating Markers."

270
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,530
But we're "Project: Bridging Them Over the Flirting Mishaps."

271
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,930
What? B-Bridging Them Over the Flirting Mishaps?

272
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,440
Well...

273
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,650
So this can... quiet down the controversy from...

274
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,560
"Love Lines"?

275
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,060
Since we had a controversy over "Love Lines,"

276
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,810
nostalgic Young Shim and Kyeong Tae will help the young people's flirting—

277
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,800
With the heart of...

278
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,860
encouraging their cute and young loves, we'll break through it!

279
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,990
CEO Wang... did you agree to this?

280
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,920
Yes, well... you might as well say I did.

281
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,960
Honestly... I can't trust you.

282
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,240
But well...

283
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,780
I'll trust Kingvely, though.

284
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,600
I love you, Kingvely.

285
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,340
"Love Mark," let's go!

286
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,020
Jang Hwan... sit down.

287
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,540
Excuse me, Chief.

288
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,410
Well, then, shall we go ahead and proceed with this project?

289
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,430
Proceed.

290
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,780
Really?

291
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,510
Yes! Proceed!

292
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,360
We did it!

293
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:31,070
♫  I miss you and I want to hear you  ♫

294
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,020
♫  I want to go to you  ♫

295
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,100
Don't be too stiff, and let's do one fighting.

296
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,640
Fighting!

297
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,390
- Fighting. 
 - Fighting.

298
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,520
All right, but please get closer.

299
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,470
And face forward!

300
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,720
Don't lean on my back.

301
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,980
You stop leaning.

302
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Well, please, looks more friendly and affectionate.

303
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,460
Especially CEO Wang, only your lips are smiling...

304
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,760
so you look too scary.

305
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,400
Please give me a smile. Smile.

306
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,960
We're working. Let's be professional.

307
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,360
- I'm being professional. 
 - Repeat after me.

308
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,200
Salted by capitalism.

309
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,310
Salty smile.

310
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,420
Smile.

311
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,150
♫  Because you're not an adult yet  ♫

312
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,080
All right! Let's be cute, lovely, and adorable.

313
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,550
Remember back when you were innocent!

314
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,030
Heart.

315
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,950
Heart.

316
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,710
Can't you seem a little more natural?

317
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,010
Should I smile more?

318
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,360
N-No, if you smile too much, your wrinkles...

319
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,600
Don't laugh!

320
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,150
What the hell? Why did you hit me?

321
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,220
You little! I had enough. I told you not to touch me!

322
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,160
Oh, yes, yes. You're looking great right now!

323
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,220
All right! Nice, nice!

324
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,890
Don't the two seem somewhat fitting?

325
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,760
Yes, their illustration styles are kind of similar.

326
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,450
What do you mean? They don't fit well at all.

327
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,090
 What's wrong with you today?

328
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,560
Who are you?

329
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,400
Oh, I'm just a coworker.

330
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
A little more. Just a little.

331
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,090
Yes, you're doing great. Very nice!

332
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,620
♫  Because there is no right answer in life  ♫

333
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,450
♫  Do it  ♫

334
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,900

335
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,520
♫  Come on, do it  ♫

336
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,100

337
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,710

338
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,090

339
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,170

340
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,690
Hey, look at this. Why don't you apply?

341
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,450
What is it?

342
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,560
- This is called "Love Mark..." 
 - It's really trending right now.

343
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,710

344
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,680
♫  We always get into a fight as soon as we run into each other  ♫

345
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,690
♫  How can love ever happen between us?  ♫

346
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,580
♫  It's unfair how I've been waiting for you  ♫

347
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,540
♫  Why are you shaking me after appearing out of nowhere?  ♫

348
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,570
What the heck?

349
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,780
We received this many?

350
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,930
Yes.

351
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,610
So many people were accessing the page during the night that it froze.

352
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,080
As expected, Korea is sincere about its flirting stage.

353
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,770
It'd be amazing if the viewer rating is as high as the number of applicants.

354
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,520
That should be. I'll make sure it happens.

355
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,550
But, Senior, when are we going to read all this?

356
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,660
This one can go out the window!

357
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,590
Pass! Pass!

358
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,090

359
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,320

360
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,360
Okay. Hello, my name is Yoo Dong In and I'm 27 years old.

361
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,190
I'm majoring in floriculture.

362
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,420
I'm currently working as a policeman.

363
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,150
I want to evolve into a mega-influencer from being a micro-influencer.

364
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,370
Please let me come out.

365
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,500
Rapper Baechu. 
  (Means cabbage)

366
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,380
You know me, right?

367
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,330
You don't, huh?

368
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,460
I'm 30 years old and...

369
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,630
Why does age matter in love? Is love a joke?

370
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,800
Gosh, ****!

371
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Well, my name is Yeo Mi Ho, who is working as a reenactment actress.

372
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,580
By the way, this is all set up already. Right?

373
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,140
I'll make sure everyone cries their eyes out with a first-love story with a terminal illness.

374
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,970
The performance fee can be negotiated.

375
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,360
They're all ****!

376
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,580
I've met someone I want to love before I die.

377
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,770
I'll be back after my divorce soon, so please pick my story.

378
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,980
Baechu will make sure to salt them all.

379
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,110
Yes... Today's meeting is—

380
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,800
Shit!

381
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,930
It looks like we're doomed. Are there more people for today?

382
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,900
Yes. We have one last applicant to interview.

383
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
Okay...

384
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,410
It looks like this gentleman will be a little different.

385
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,590
Next applicant, please come in.

386
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,940
- Oh, h-hello. 
 - Hello.

387
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,530
Hi.

388
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,070
First, please introduce yourself to us.

389
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,730
Well, my name is Nam Ki Ho, a 37-year-old salaryman.

390
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,580
Yes. Thank you for the story you posted.

391
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,700
Yes.

392
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,070
Could you please tell us why you submitted your story in short?

393
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,980
Oh, yes. Well, the thing is...

394
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,990
Oh, well...

395
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,950
Sh-She is the kind of person who...

396
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,530
One moment, please! Wait for me!

397
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,790
One second! Wait! Please wait-

398
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,590
 I have this one colleague at work.

399
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,970
 Her name is Jeong Yeo Wool.

400
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,680
Nice save.

401
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,600

402
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,060
 We talk throughout our entire day at work.

403
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,320

404
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,670
 She gives snacks only to me.

405
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,790
 We get off work together.

406
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,230

We even eat meals together.

407
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,130
 We also have a drink or two sometimes.

408
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,270

409
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,620
You two drank alone, but nothing happened?

410
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,950
Couldn't it be she has a boyfriend she didn't tell you about?

411
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,850
No, she doesn't have one. I know this because...

412
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,320
I had asked her directly.

413
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,190
What could be the problem, then?

414
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,810
It has been two years like this without a-any change.

415
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,000
Two years?

416
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:04,560
Didn't you try asking her out or anything else from that point on?

417
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,570
No, I did. I did ask her out.

418
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,680
Yeo Wool even gave me a present on my birthday, so I said I'd buy dinner.

419
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,040
So that day, I mustered up all the courage I had.

420
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,030
Happy birthday, Ki Ho.

421
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,780
I bought one because I thought it would look good on you.

422
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,930
Gosh, I'm sure you were busy, though.

423
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,870
Thank you so much for celebrating my birthday, Yeo Wool.

424
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,660
Gosh, don't mention it.

425
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,420
Goodness, s-shall we toast?

426
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,320
Cheers.

427
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,310
- Oh, p-please give me your plate. 
 - Oh, okay, here.

428
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,060
- I got it. 
 - Okay.

429
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,140
- Please just give me a little. 
 - Sure, sure.

430
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,860
Thank you.

431
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,420
Excuse me, Yeo Wool...

432
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,440
are you doing anything this Christmas?

433
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,300
This Christmas?

434
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,400
Yes. Would you like to go see a show with me on Christmas?

435
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,130
Oh, well...

436
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,720
that will be a bit difficult.

437
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,560
How come?

438
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,450
I believe in Buddhism, so I don't celebrate Christmas...

439
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,820
but Buddha's Birthday might be okay.

440
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,360
 Asking to see on Christmas is the same as asking her out.

441
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,610
But you did that?

442
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,950
You shouldn't pressure the other person by going straightforward in this case.

443
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,140
But since Yeo Wool even gave him a birthday present, couldn't she also be interested in him?

444
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,160
It could be because she's overwhelmed by the idea of dating in the office.

445
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,320
I think that's when things started to get weird.

446
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,120
Well, then, wh-what about the weekends?

447
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,070
I need to go work out on the weekends.

448
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,340
Oh, what kind of exercise do you do?

449
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,760
Should we work out together, then?

450
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,170
I think that will be a little difficult.

451
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,680
What's the reason?

452
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,360
I work out by doing 3,000 bows on the weekends.

453
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,090
3,000 bows?

454
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,960
Yes.

455
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,980
You bow down 3,000 times?

456
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,900
 I'm sure the mood was good before that point.

457
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,730
Please have some.

458
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:23,510
I never thought I'd be coming to a place like a broadcast station in my life.

459
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,330
I really considered myself crazy

460
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,580
when I applied, so, please...

461
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,450
P-Please... help me out.

462
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,590
Okay.

463
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,780
We'll contact you again after a careful review.

464
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,550
I really only worked all my life...

465
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,180
and really, without any reason...

466
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,150
I f-fell for her, really just for who she is.

467
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,180
For the first time in my life.

468
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,410
I really don't want to give up here.

469
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,490
Giving up at the appropriate time can also...

470
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,070
be helpful in regard to your entire life.

471
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,450
G-Giving up?

472
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,700
Ki Ho, w-we'll contact you.

473
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,420
I've never heard of stronger friend zoning in my life.

474
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,540
Friend zone? Maybe she has her own circumstances?

475
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,700
Or there could be a problem with the applicant we don't know about.

476
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,680
Kyeong Tae, what do you think?

477
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,140
- I oppose this. 
 - Why?

478
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,360
Why are you like that only to Ki Ho's story?

479
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,900
The difficulty level doesn't even seem that high for this case.

480
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,910
Difficulty level?

481
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,020
This is a total mess right now.

482
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,960
How desperate must he have been to come all the way here?

483
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,720
He's way older than the program's target audience, and he looks old, too.

484
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,180
He doesn't suit our Kingvely's image.

485
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,720
And...

486
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,360
even if we proceed with this, he could end up getting hurt.

487
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,840
Yeah, there must be more fresh and fun stories.

488
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,750
But how desperate must he have been to come all the way here?

489
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,730
I also think there will be a lot of people who can relate to this story.

490
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,030
It's a waste of time.

491
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,800
I didn't come here to do charity work.

492
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,060
Why play a game that presents... no probability of winning?

493
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,020
I don't know. I just want to cast this person, no matter what.

494
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,080
Advertising Kingvely is important, but I think sincerity comes first.

495
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,910
PD Oh Young Shim, I'm the one who holds the right...

496
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,760
to make the final decisions, didn't we say?

497
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,070
 (Me.)

498
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,790
 How is it?

499
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,470
 It's fine, right?

500
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,830
 Wait, even I need to be a cast as well?

501
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,890
 Since the idea itself was inspired, all thanks to Kingvely...

502
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,030
 How is it? Don't you like the title?

503
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,440
 "Love Mark."

504
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,670
 "Love Mark..."

505
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:27,490
 Please, Chief is going to change his mind after tomorrow.

506
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,590
 There's a condition, then.

507
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,010
 A condition?

508
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:38,400
 I'll be the one with the final say in matters regarding the show.

509
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,730
 Wait, that's a little too...

510
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,330
 Even so, I'm the PD...

511
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,490
 Right?

512
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,990
 - Yeah. 
 - It'll be hard, right?

513
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,020
 Yeah.

514
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,680
 It'll be hard.

515
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,400
 I'm sure it'll be hard. Forget it.

516
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,420
 Wait, Kyeong Tae!

517
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,460
 Here, here. Relax and lean back.

518
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,900
 This is what CEOs do. Right?

519
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,470
 Yes. Right.

520
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,860
 - This is why one becomes a CEO. 
 - Seriously...

521
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,730
 You become a CEO to do everything your way.

522
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,590
 Right?

523
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,600
I-If you say so, I can't help it, then.

524
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,440
Senior? But this is wrong.

525
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,650
CEO Wang says he's against it, so we can't help it.

526
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,110
All right, now!

527
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,340
Let's call it a day here.

528
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,860
Yes, thank you for your work.

529
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,090
 Thank you for your work.

530
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,610
 I f-fell for her really just for who she is.

531
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,210
 For the first time in my life.

532
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,080
 I really don't want to give up here.

533
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,620
Everyone's got someone they like or a date... but what the heck am I doing?

534
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,940
I only work for other people's benefit, huh?

535
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,680
And also, you don't have to drop me off from now on.

536
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,840
It's tiring for you.

537
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,610
 Don't give her any time for something to happen with Kyeong Tae and throw a lot of hints!

538
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,420
 Understand?

539
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,130
No, Senior. I'm doing this because I want to.

540
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,810
You were stressed out a lot today because of CEO Wang. Right?

541
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,490
Yeah...

542
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,370
That will be part of my daily life for a while now, just like the air I breathe.

543
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,230
If you have any problems in the future, you can tell me everything. I'll help you.

544
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,170
I heard we're having trouble recruiting the rest of the staff positions. Should I work on that?

545
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,470
No, no. It's okay. I'll take care of it.

546
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,020
Whoa, Chae Dong... worrying about your senior.

547
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,620
You're all grown up!

548
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,180
I'm not a junior anymore.

549
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,870
I'm a man now, too, Senior.

550
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,250
Hey, what's with you?

551
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,800
- Senior... 
 - Yes.

552
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,670
I'm now—

553
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,350
Take care.

554
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,720
PD Oh? Let's have a word.

555
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,820
What, now?

556
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,280
Let's choose Ki Ho.

557
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,960
What?

558
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,300
You changed your mind? What made you change your mind?

559
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,820
I just feel like it.

560
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,510
Yay! In any case, we can help Ki Ho now, huh?

561
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,760
Yes! I'm so happy.

562
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,890
However, there's a problem we need to solve.

563
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,900
A problem?

564
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,640
Do you think you can cast Jeong Yeo Wool?

565
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,550
I've already taken care of that.

566
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,240
 If you come out on the show, it'll remain as a public record...

567
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,710
 and there will be comments as well.

568
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,910
 It might even become your permanent source of stress.

569
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,670
 Will you be okay?

570
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,750
 The reason we still came to see you

571
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,510
 is because we want to create a good memory for you and Ki Ho.

572
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,420
 Because I felt sincerity from Ki Ho.

573
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,560
 Well...

574
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,540
 Okay. I'll give it a shot.

575
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,500
 Really?

576
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,360
 Will you really be okay with this?

577
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,200
 I think it'll also be a good memory for me.

578
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,810

579
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,870
Hello.

580
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,090
Hello!

581
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,050
You dressed the way you usually dress, right?

582
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,170
- Yes. 
 - All right. Okay, I see.

583
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,220
We'll do a test photoshoot with our app if you can just stand over there.

584
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:58,040
 Single untrendy outlet clothes that are optimized for the daily commute and overtime...

585
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,810
 vague length of hair, grown to cover pimple scars and short chin,

586
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,780
 slouched shoulders and tech neck.

587
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,360

588
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,050

589
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,650
Oh Young Shim, let's really do this well this time.

590
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,740
- Senior. 
 - Yeah.

591
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,300
The sun's going to set soon.

592
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,030
Oh, you're right.

593
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,580
CEO Wang and Ki Ho haven't arrived yet?

594
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,640
No, they said there's some traffic.

595
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,500
Then Team B should stand by here until Wol Sook and Yeo Wool arrive.

596
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,980
- Chae Dong and I will check the route. 
 - Okay.

597
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,600
Let's go.

598
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,460
Amazing. Look at that sunset.

599
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,190
It's so pretty.

600
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,590
You made it, CEO Wang.

601
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,900
- Hello. 
 - Oh?

602
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,460
- Wow. 
 - Amazing.

603
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,850
Are you really Ki Ho?

604
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,410
Yes.

605
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,840
Where's PD Oh Young Shim?

606
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,270
Oh, she's inside checking the route.

607
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,340
Once Jeong Yeo Wool and Goo Wol Sook arrive,

608
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,730
we'll do the interview and head to the dorm.

609
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,890
If you wait here for a moment, we'll—

610
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,140
What's wrong?

611
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,430
My stomach hurt since a while back...

612
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,800
It must be because I'm nervous.

613
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,020
Where's the r-restroom?

614
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,240
Over there.

615
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,040
It's right there.

616
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,570
Excuse me.

617
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,180
Geez, now of all times?

618
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,170
I can relate to Ki Ho.

619
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,600
I also had a stomach ache before the concert and ended up being 30 minutes late.

620
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,060
Was that it?

621
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,830
I did officially ask her out after the concert ended.

622
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,130
And?

623
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,190
She said she'd think about it, but it's been days and I haven't heard from her.

624
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,990
This is a bad sign, isn't it?

625
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:07,390
I told you, it's up to you now.

626
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,940
Whatever the result... accept it.

627
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,460
I heard there's a wishing rock here.

628
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,900
Will making a wish make a difference?

629
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,220
Wishing rock?

630
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,800
That can't be real, though.

631
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,230
Senior, we need to prepare for the shoot first.

632
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,900
CEO Wang, you'll bring Ki Ho with you. Right?

633
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,870
- I'll bring him with me. 
 - Okay.

634
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:38,190
Then we'll head to Daeungjeon Hall first.

635
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,460
Come on, Senior. What's wrong with you? Stop.

636
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,170
Go.

637
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,120
Wishing rock?

638
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,350
Senior, watch out. There are many jagged stones. It's dangerous.

639
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,570
Oh, okay.

640
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,500
They say if you make a wish here, one wish will definitely come true.

641
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,420
Really?

642
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,710
If you make a wish and if Buddha here smiles,

643
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,000
it'll come true or something.

644
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,330
No way. Do you think that's possible?

645
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,660
I'm serious.

646
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,860
It's pretty popular, and people line up for the new year.

647
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,720
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

648
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,120
Why isn't he coming out?

649
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,210
- Hello? 
  - CEO Wang, I—

650
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,140
Hello?

651
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,830
 - Hello?  
 - Hello?

652
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,000
 - CEO Wang.  
 - Can you hear me?

653
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,620
Pardon me, but my phone service isn't good here.

654
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,010
Where can I go for a better signal?

655
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,130
If you go toward the wishing rock, it should be better.

656
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,350
Okay, thank you.

657
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,350
Done.

658
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,320
What did you wish for?

659
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,410
Hold on.

660
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,600
I need to check if Buddha is smiling or not.

661
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,660
It seems like he is... or maybe he isn't...

662
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,570
I can't tell because it's dark.

663
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,800
What do you think?

664
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:47,590
I think... he has a smile on his face.

665
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,040
- Really? 
 - Yes.

666
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,720
This place must like me.

667
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,800
All right. I'll help you make your wish, too.

668
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,710
Go ahead and tell me.

669
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,410
- My wish? 
 - Yeah.

670
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,110
I'll pray with you. I have a good feeling.

671
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,540
Hurry up and tell me.

672
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,950
Come on. Hurry up and tell me.

673
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,110
Come on—

674
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,780
Senior, I like you.

675
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,590
H-Huh?

676
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,640
My wish...

677
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,850
is for you to like me back.

678
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,360
Stop joking around—

679
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:52,090

680
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,790
♫  You've done great so far  ♫

681
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,890
♫  I'll carry the burden on your shoulders with you from now on  ♫

682
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,960

683
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,360
 Don't scratch your head. Square your shoulders.

684
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,860
 Why does it look so drab?

685
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,530
 Weren't we a variety show, not a documentary?

686
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,760
 Are you kidding me right now?

687
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,420
 I've been too nice. What did you just say?

688
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,860
 I want to use this chance to hit it off with Kyeong Tae.

689
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,700
 You'll support me, right?

690
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,030
 Why should I?

691
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,450
 User's excitement has been detected.

692
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,690
 Excitement?

693
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,080
 Use that timing to confess to her.

694
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,850
 There's a high probability you'll succeed.

695
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:33,580
 I also have something to confess to you.

696
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,660
 Can I go first?

697
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,200
 This is... damn it!

698
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,090
 Yeo Wool, you can't!
