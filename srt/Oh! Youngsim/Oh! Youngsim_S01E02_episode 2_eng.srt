1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,860

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,900

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,390

4
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,950

5
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,250

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,910

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,060

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,680
He came exactly on time.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,450
You should tell him to hurry up and come in.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,660
Why isn't he coming up?

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,590
He's coming from the elevator, not that way.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:59,390

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,570
Hello.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,240
♫  You've done great so far  ♫

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,630
♫  I'll carry the burden on your shoulders with you from now  ♫

16
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,610
♫  The countless mountains you overcame prove you've been doing great  ♫

17
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,520
Hello. I'm Kingvely's CEO, Mark...

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,630
Wang Kyeong Tae.

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,310
♫  You have the right to do that  ♫

20
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:44,830
♫  You can bury your face in your sleeves and cry all you want  ♫

21
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,060
♫  When things don't go as you wish and when you want to fall to the ground  ♫

22
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,190
♫  Try screaming out until you feel better  ♫

23
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,920
♫  To yourself from yesterday, who must have gone through a lot  ♫

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,930

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,490
 Mark is the Wang Kyeong Tae I know?

26
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,110
 No way. They must share the same name.

27
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,260
 He's handsome like that... and most of all,

28
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,230
 there's no way he turned out that successful.

29
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,080
 He founded Kingvely?

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,000
 The snot-faced midget did?

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,970
Is he really the Kingvely guy?

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,470
Amazing, he's handsome.

33
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,850
He's really handsome.

34
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,510
 Hello.

35
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,430
 Yes!

36
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,320
He's that Wang Kyeong Tae, right?

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,310
Why didn't you tell me? Is this a friend special?

38
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,110
Does he look like Wang Kyeong Tae to you, too?

39
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,420
He became cool enough to blow his past away...

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,760
but Wang Kyeong Tae isn't a common name.

41
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,340
And most of all, he still has some of his old face.

42
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,890
Kingvely is... Wang Kyeong Tae, you say?

43
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,390
- Let's go up to him and ask. 
 - No!

44
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,200
What if he turns out to be the real Wang Kyeong Tae?

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,330
It'll become super interesting, then.

46
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,070
- Let's confirm it. 
 - No, stop—

47
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,080
Goo Wol Sook?

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
- We need to mic you up. Please come. 
 - Yes, sure.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,170
All right? Make sure to ask him.

50
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,390
Ask him what?

51
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,390
Could you... happen to...

52
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,900
be W-Wang...

53
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,600
I can't hear you well.

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,130
You're Wang Kyeong Tae, right?

55
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,830
My name is indeed Wang Kyeong Tae.

56
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,940
Do you know me, PD Oh Young Shim?

57
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,040
CEO Wang, please take a seat over there.

58
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,140
What in the world...

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,570
He's really Wang Kyeong Tae, though.

60
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,010
I think he is Wang Kyeong Tae.

61
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,100
Senior, S-Senior! Big trouble!

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,060
- We're in deep trouble! 
 - Wh-Why? Why?

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,190
The second female participant, Kim Gyu Ri!

64
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,500
She got into a car accident and is on the way to the hospital right now.

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,740
A car accident?

66
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,360
Hey! I mean...

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,250
I-Is she okay?

68
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,280
Yes, well. She did call personally in the ambulance just now.

69
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,450
But I don't think she can come to the shoot.

70
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,760
Gosh, this is really bad.

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,400
We need to go into shoot soon, Senior.

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,990
It's not like we can cast a participant right now.

73
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,900
- G-Go and contact the backup list. 
 - Y-Yes, I'll give them a call.

74
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,690
I knew I felt nervous about something.

75
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,510
Hello.

76
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,010
Hey.

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,220
You have time for this?

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,860
What brings you here?

79
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,990
I was on the way to visit Hee Jin and stopped by to see if Kingvely really came.

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,450
Hey, what are the requirements for participation?

81
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,470
Yes. Any unmarried Korean adults in their 20s and 30s in good health.

82
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,590
Hey, w-wait.

83
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,540
Come on!

84
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,800
- Is show business a joke to you? 
 - Right?

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,750
Me?

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,210
No.

87
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,020
Me?

88
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,260
No, no.

89
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,060
Okay!

90
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,790
I'll give it a go! How bad can it be?

91
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,990
Come on. I can do it, too!

92
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,330
Really? Will you be okay?

93
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,050
You have to be a Korean adult in good health and have a lot of charms...

94
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,560
Although you lack the charms, you've got the skills and cheats. Right?

95
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,450
Of course. I'm known for my charms.

96
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,290
For now, I'll do my best!

97
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,030
Get yourself together. All right, check the situation first.

98
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,910
I'll go get makeup first.

99
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,770
- Makeup Team! 
 - Hurry! Hurry!

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,050
Hey, Chae Dong, are we good to go?

101
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,610
- Wait, Senior. 
 - Wh-What's up?

102
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,600
Why?

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,620
Gosh, I look funny. Right?

104
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,410
- Nope. 
 - Am I okay?

105
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,630
Hold onto this for now.

106
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,170
- We're done setting up, right? I'm going up. 
 - Yes.

107
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,850
- Yes, yes! 
 - We need to start now!

108
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,320
Hey, let's go if we're all ready!

109
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,380
Good to go.

110
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,460
All right. We're going into shoot now!

111
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,350
Ready! Cue!

112
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,650
 "Love Lines" is easy and simple.

113
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,280
 Kingvely's AI will create the matching orders, and

114
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,080
 old-school retro themes for each date.

115
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,860
 With one day as the limit...

116
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,420
 after going on a date with each participant,

117
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,170
 the final selections will take place.

118
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,630
 First off, prior to introductions,

119
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,900
 shall we check your feelings based only on first impressions of each other?

120
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,340
 That's right. No need to get nervous from the beginning.

121
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,710
 I give pretty good first impressions.

122
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,870

123
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,850
 Here are the results from First Impressions Voting.

124
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,910

125
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,690

126
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,270

127
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,780

128
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,890

129
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,640
 Are you done checking the results?

130
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,640
 The first date from Kingvely's match will begin.

131
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,200

132
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,350

133
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,830
How long does it take to prepare for stuff like a body profile?

134
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,030
Would I be able to get an S-line like a model?

135
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,190
If you're a PD... it means you're busy.

136
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,630
Just be content with how you look.

137
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,890
Be content?

138
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,850
 Be content, you said?

139
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,820
 Is being a ripped and popular personal trainer a trophy?

140
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,490
Excuse me!

141
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,740
 He's got shitty manners and is so particular!

142
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,820
You can't! Calm down.

143
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,300
 Do I have to bring that out?

144
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,030
Yes?

145
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,580
You've got something to say?

146
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,780
It's not that.

147
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,710
Do you... happen to know Oh Youngsim?

148
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,230
Youngsim.

149
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,540
Youngsim?

150
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,770
What the heck is that? Is that a person's name?

151
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,320
You don't know Youngsim?

152
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,680
I don't.

153
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,190
- You never heard the Youngsim song? 
 - Never.

154
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,710
There's no way you don't know the Youngsim song.

155
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,580
♪  One means one, not two  ♪

156
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,420
♪  Two means two, not three  ♪

157
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,970
- What's the matter? 
 - ♪  Three means three  ♪

158
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,150
- P-Please sit down. 
 - ♪  It doesn't mean four  ♪

159
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,970
People are looking! Please sit down.

160
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,300
You can sing all day, but I won't have any idea.

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,390
What?

162
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,340
There's no way you wouldn't know. Listen carefully.

163
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,680
♪  Five means five, it doesn't mean six  ♪

164
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,370
Please. Please sit down.

165
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,990
- W-Wait— 
 - Geez.

166
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,680
You're being inconsiderate.

167
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,470
Although I talk like this, I have lived abroad for a long time, since I was young

168
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,400
and didn't even watch TV.

169
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,920
Even people in the U.S. know Youngsim, though.

170
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
Geez. I don't know what it is.

171
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,930
Did it lose a lot of recognition?

172
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,920
Do we have enough screen time?

173
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,750
We didn't get any for the guy.

174
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,100
You need to keep going.

175
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,800
There's not enough?

176
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,210
Hey, when is this going to end?

177
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,920

178
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,480
Whoa! That thing!

179
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,700
Th-That thing over there.

180
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,350
Why don't we give that a try?

181
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,020
If we eat spicy food in five minutes, we'll be eating for free!

182
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,030
Let's try that out!

183
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,120
Why do such an idiotic thing?

184
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,990
Gosh, it sounds fun! Let's try.

185
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,290
In tteokbokki, the chili paste is carbs, and the flour is carbs.

186
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,280
It's got tons of sugar and calories.

187
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,340
Excuse me! Over here! We're going to challenge level five spicy!

188
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,960
You can go ahead if you wish.

189
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,500
How much time do we have left?

190
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,530
It's about time.

191
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,380
What? No way.

192
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,990
Please just eat one egg for me.

193
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,640
I'll eat the whites only.

194
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,000
The yoke has too much fat. Geez...

195
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,010
It's delicious, at least.

196
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,640
Over here! I finished it!

197
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,620
Y-You win.

198
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,430
You're the first person to win the event.

199
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,850
You can eat the entire menu for free for a month.

200
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,760

201
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,600

CEO Wang, what's your definition of fashion?

202
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,280
I think fashion is a weapon that increases

203
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,630
you value as a person, not simply clothing.

204
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,160
I think so, too.

205
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,840
By the way, how did you happen to start Kingvely?

206
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,020
I got interested in neuroscience while suffering from nightmares

207
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,130
every night due to a certain incident when I was young.

208
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,260
Naturally, I ended up studying AI in college.

209
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,150
What's the childhood incident you mentioned?

210
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,340
As for that...

211
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,760
I can't tell you that in detail. But I wanted to use deep learning, which I majored in

212
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,670
to help find your style without wasting time and efficiently.

213
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,380
I worked day and night since the beginning of the venture to build data

214
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,210
that could be the Bible of fashion.

215
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,660
And I got a big investment in fashion AI for everyone...

216
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,950
and started Kingvely.

217
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,320
I see.

218
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,890
Oh, you've got a catering service, too.

219
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,900
Is it because it's Kingvely? The employee amenities are great.

220
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:46,210
Today's menu is the nostalgic king pork cutlet, made with a black pig that was only fed

221
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,550
field grass and garlic, antibiotic-free.

222
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,090
Of all things...

223
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,500
 I want to eat a pork cutlet.

224
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,820
 If you want to, then I want to as well.

225
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,950

(Item on sale)

226
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,670
 The mixed pork cutlet is the only menu on sale.

227
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,910
 One mixed pork cutlet, please.

228
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,640
 Here's your mixed pork cutlet.

229
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,460
 I can't eat spicy food.

230
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,630
 I'm the same.

231
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,840
 What kind of a man can't even eat spicy food?

232
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,060
 What are you even good at?

233
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,340
 I can eat it.

234
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,320
 I can do it.

235
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,600
Please give it a taste.

236
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,400
My company boasts the nostalgic king pork cutlet made with a black pig.

237
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,710
Is it hard to cut?

238
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,240
- Yes. 
 - In that case...

239
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,320
I'll cut it for you.

240
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,550
This little guy...

241
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,990

242
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,570
All right, we're going to shoot now.

243
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,210
Sang Eun, you prepped everything properly, right?

244
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,440
Yes, I did.

245
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,590
- Safety is our top priority, so watch out for that. 
 - Yes.

246
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,960
All right. Let's go.

247
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,110
Chae Dong, shoot from afar, so it looks nice.

248
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,910

I haven't been on a pedalboat in 20 years.

249
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,580
They've even got motored pedalboats now.

250
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,810
Me, too.

251
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,270
To be hanging out on a boat on a weekday at the Han River...

252
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,740
Don't you think this is what happiness is?

253
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,610
Young Shim...

254
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,060
- Yes. 
 - What do you think happiness is?

255
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,880
Sorry?

256
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,580
- Happiness? 
 - Yes, happiness.

257
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,550
The topic I always want to question

258
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,340
is happiness, which is what I did in my first short story.

259
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,100
You've read my work, right?

260
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,290
Yes...

261
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,680
 They said Ho Jae is a writer. Right?

262
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,970
 I didn't get to read any of it. What do I do?

263
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,340

264
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,120

265
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,130
Young Shim?

266
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,630
Yes?

267
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,100
Right, this thing called happiness is...

268
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,360
Ah, well... Y-Yes.

269
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,360
On a day you feel down, try walking the streets. 
  (Lyrics from a 90s Korean pop song)

270
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,080
And also, try getting drunk with a bittersweet cocktail.

271
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,790
Go where there's a poem... I mean, a picture-

272
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,900
How did you know I majored in poetry in college?

273
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,770
Oh, yes.

274
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,000
By the way, Young Shim...

275
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,180
- Yes. 
 - Your face is looking unwell.

276
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,300
My face?

277
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,220
Oh, I always look poopy... because I'm always overworked.

278
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,720
No, no. You're too pale, as white as snow.

279
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,050
Is it because I'm feeling happy for the first time in a while?

280
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,350
I am getting a bit dizzy.

281
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,160
What's wrong? Are you nauseous?

282
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,550
D-Do you feel like you have to vomit?

283
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,200
No, not at all. I'm okay.

284
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,120
You're not uncomfortable being with me or finding my face uncomfortable. Right?

285
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,450
N-No, not at all.

286
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,370
Gosh, what do we do?

287
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,990
I-I'll get to the dock quickly, so hang in there for a bit.

288
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,910
H-Hurry up.

289
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,590
It's not even budging.

290
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,790
Do you think you can wait?

291
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,740
Hey, what's wrong?

292
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,810
PD Lee! I think she has to vomit!

293
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,270
- I-I'm sorry, Young Shim. 
 - I'm okay.

294
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,970
What?

295
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,570
Wait, Senior!

296
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,530
I can't swim! S-Senior...

297
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,820
Senior—

298
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,500
Good god, seriously.

299
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,000
Geez! He just has to cause more trouble.

300
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,790
- Hey, you idiot! 
 - Senior!

301
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,600
Senior!

302
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Senior... Senior!

303
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,750
Hey! Hey!

304
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,660
You're a handful, seriously!

305
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,270
I just can't live!

306
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,270
Hey, hey.

307
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,030
Get yourself together!

308
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,200
- Senior... 
 - Wake up.

309
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,600
Pull him up. One, two, three!

310
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,860
- Senior, are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

311
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,820
Hey, wait.

312
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,550
No, the mic! H-Hey, is it still working?

313
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,380
Gosh, it's more expensive than my life.

314
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,870
Does the mic matter right now?

315
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,650
Hey, take it and dry it out.

316
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,160
Wait, Senior...

317
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,610
Hey!

318
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,830
Hey, he doesn't have a mic. Right?

319
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,260
Whoa, shit! Over here.

320
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,350
Hey, hey! The in-ear, the in-ear!

321
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,200
Geez, geez! Hey, dry these out, too.

322
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,770
Am I alive?

323
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,040
I'm alive.

324
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,210

You're really good.

325
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,050
Gosh, I'm not sure if I still got it.

326
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,740
So cool!

327
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,310
- Do you want to try? 
 - Me?

328
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,060
- Right there in the center— 
 - I got it!

329
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,860
I heard you went to study abroad when you were young, Mark.

330
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,610
But you're way better than I am.

331
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,980
You're bound to win a game if you're competitive and have a strategy.

332
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,940
Didn't you wear glasses when you were young?

333
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,790
And have Angyeongtae as your nickname? 
  (Angyeong means glasses in Korean)

334
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,760
Oh, I was going to mention this new product from our company.

335
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,270
How is it? Does it look good on me?

336
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,410
We'll take a pause here and swap out the memory card.

337
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,980
Sure.

338
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,230
It's you, right?

339
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,120
You're the Wang Kyeong Tae I know— Oh, my!

340
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,100
This means you're really Wang Kyeong Tae.

341
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,980
Why aren't you saying anything?

342
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,200
Although you've become unrecognizably cooler over time,

343
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,850
you still can't fool my eyes.

344
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,970
Why are you coming right back out?

345
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,920
What did you do in there?

346
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,120
It's nothing.

347
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,670
 Second dates have been completed.

348
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,000
 We'll begin the intermediate voting.

349
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,460

350
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,650

351
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,980
 Do we have any participants who changed their minds after the dates?

352
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,880

353
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,780

354
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,570
 This is interesting.

355
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,590
 The final dates for "Love Lines" begins now.

356
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,510
Let me teach you this exercise.

357
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,480
You have to pull with your chest.

358
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,000
Whoa, you're really good.

359
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,700
"State of Mind."

360
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,400
"They say love is like a sudden car accident."

361
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,130
- Where is this place? 
 - Get yourself together.

362
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,180
- Senior! 
 - Yes.

363
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,080
Gosh, are you okay?

364
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,610
I heard what happened.

365
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,500
Do you think I'd be okay? We drank so much of the Han River—

366
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,670
We were so close to death, seriously.

367
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,050
It can't be helped even if you're not okay.

368
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,900
You know we have to finish this today, right?

369
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,510
Gosh. Hey, but what's going on?

370
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,150
We never talked about karaoke.

371
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll take care of everything.

372
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,750
It's better to make screen time this way than to eat tteokbokki on a date.

373
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,010
Do something about this.

374
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,900
Senior, there's nothing to prepare for. Just do as you always do.

375
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,400
This is the last thing on the list. I'll get you home quickly.

376
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,100
- Go dry her hair first. 
 - Her hair? What about mine?

377
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,390
Senior, fighting!

378
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,300
The last date is a competition date where there's a mission.

379
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,500
A competition?

380
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,150
I got the hint from your arcade date with Goo Wol Sook earlier.

381
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,650
You'll choose the song for each other and

382
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:31,330
the person who scores higher on the song gets a wish in this mission.

383
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,260
There's no time, Senior.

384
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,580
Please choose a song for the other person.

385
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,760
- Perfect Score Mode is prepared. Right? 
 - Yes, it's ready.

386
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,440
Who should go first?

387
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,850
Lady's first.

388
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,790
Don't regret it.

389
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,440

390
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,190
This song was sung by 17 people. How can I do this alone? Wang—

391
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,000
Mark Wang-

392
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,590

393
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,810
♫  Don't stop here, win, win  ♫

394
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,160
♫  I've been waiting for a long time  ♫

395
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,010
♫  I watch you in patience, patience, patience  ♫

396
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,360
♫  Whoa, whoa, whoa  ♫

397
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,490
♫  Are you running?  ♫

398
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,830
♫  I'm flying in the sky, I'm watching from up here  ♫

399
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,750
Hey, she's doing better than I expected.

400
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,500
She's really good at this.

401
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,670
♫  I don't want to lose, I really don't want to lose  ♫

402
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,050
♫  Fight and win, why don't you try and beat me?  ♫

403
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,580
♫  I'll take all of you on, everyone, come at me  ♫

404
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,940
♫  Don't be jealous because you're not one of them  ♫

405
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,010
I think she's going to really faint.

406
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,090
♫  Just wait for Seven from there, you loser!  ♫

407
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,420
♫  Don't stop here, win, win  ♫

408
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,570
♫  I've been waiting for you, patience, patience  ♫

409
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,540
♫  Sometimes I watch patiently, patience, patience  ♫

410
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,210
♫  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  ♫

411
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,840

Future King of Singing!

412
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,770
Your turn.

413
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,550
8-8-6-9.

414
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:37,200
♫  You thought I'm easy prey, didn't you?  ♫

415
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,940
♫  It was a mistake to meet you  ♫

416
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,830
♫  You weren't interested in love at all  ♫

417
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:58,240
♫  You only needed me, who'd do everything just as you say  ♫

418
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,890
♫  and who thinks you're my everything  ♫

419
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:12,580
♫  Put everything back the way they were before I met you  ♫

420
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,250
 What kind of a man can't even eat spicy food?

421
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,620
 What are you even good at?

422
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,660
 That's the difference between you and me.

423
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,540
 Don't even think about a tree you can't climb.

424
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
 Young Shim!

425
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,320
 Young Shim...

426
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,270
♫  I was hurt too deeply to just say they're good memories  ♫

427
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:57,030
♫  I'll wish when you fall in love with someone else next time  ♫

428
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,020
♫  that you'll meet someone who's like you  ♫

429
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,110
What's wrong with him?

430
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,250

You're the superstar of this place!

431
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,590
97 points. 97!

432
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,400
Yes! Yes! YES!

433
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,150
CEO Wang...

434
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,770
Y-Yes?

435
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,940
I was relieving a lot of stress since I haven't sung in a long time.

436
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,730
O-Okay. Congratulations, CEO Wang.

437
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,930
That was a breathtaking performance.

438
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,970
All right. You can say what you want from Oh Young Shim.

439
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,180
Oh, okay.

440
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,970
My wish is...

441
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,580
Are you done choosing?

442
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,910
My wish is to buy this today.

443
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,380
What is it?

444
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,360
Headphones?

445
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,590
 Excuse me.

446
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,670
 Me?

447
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,730
 You got something to say?

448
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,080
 Could I see those headphones for a second?

449
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,390
 These? Why?

450
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,990

What are you doing right now? Give them back.

451
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,730
 Where did you get these?

452
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,760
 What's it got to do with you?

453
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,590
 Seriously.

454
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,490
This model has been discontinued, so it won't be sold in the future.

455
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,960
Well...

456
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,860
Even so, it's better to get the new models.

457
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,420
These look better.

458
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:49,400
A person who doesn't cherish other people's feelings wouldn't understand this.

459
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,190
 What's he saying?

460
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,630
 Is he dissing me right now?

461
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,920
Looks like you're reminded of something.

462
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,250
That's what your face looks like.

463
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,320
 How dare he make me wait?

464
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,520
 Just go ahead and show your face.

465
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,550
 I'll smash you to the ground.

466
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,670
You're aware promises... are included in people's feelings. Right?

467
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,020
Wouldn't it be the same as

468
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:41,400
not cherishing other people's feelings if you break promises without a word?

469
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,810
All right, then.

470
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,030
I-I'll just buy them for you.

471
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,970
Hope your eardrums will get a blow.

472
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm suddenly reminded of back then.

473
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,430
Don't you remember...

474
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,390
Young Shim?

475
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,710
What did he say just now?

476
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,800
Hey, it's getting recorded right now. Right?

477
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,430
Hey, Chae Dong!

478
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,060
Do they know each other from before?

479
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:25,610
♫  Some feelings just can't remain  ♫

480
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,340
- Right. CEO Wang. 
 - Yeah?

481
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,970
You know the second male participant, the writer. Right?

482
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:35,590
He said he can't log into his account on the app, so he wants it checked out.

483
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,520
All right. I'll check.

484
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,280

485
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,770
♫  I'm going to become the love of your life  ♫

486
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,630
What's this?

487
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,250

488
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,210
He chose Young Shim?

489
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,270
Senior, do you know him?

490
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,970
♫  Without fail  ♫

491
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:10,510
♫  I won't hold back anymore, I'll run to you  ♫

492
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,070
 We'll start the shoot in the studio in 10 minutes!

493
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,440
No matter how I think about this, our rules are way too insensitive.

494
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,600
Right? Right?

495
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,220
How can a person's feelings get decided in one day?

496
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,150
Things like this can cause controversy. So—

497
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,190
Oh, right! Wh-What's it called again?

498
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,290
Let's put revival matches in there. Okay?

499
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,800
Yes, that's what we said we should do during the intermediate discussion.

500
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,890
- When? 
 - The intermediate discussion.

501
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,160
When? I did?

502
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,490
You said let's make it simple and just keep going since there's no time.

503
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,840
When did I ever?

504
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,130
- Senior. 
 - Yeah?

505
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,720
You did say that. Please go up.

506
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,320
- I did? 
 - Yes, you did.

507
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,570
Did you make your final selection?

508
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,260
Yes.

509
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,200
Did you hear that?

510
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,890
Hear what?

511
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,580
That guy, Wang Kyeong Tae...

512
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,590
I heard he's acquainted with Oh Young Shim, one of the female participants.

513
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,220
I heard they're first crushes from childhood or something.

514
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,180
Kingvely or Goblin, it looks like we got into the wrong game of rigged poker,

515
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,520
which is for advertising their products.

516
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,110
 Sam Doo and Ho Jae, please come up to the stage!

517
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,100
Oh, okay.

518
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,320
 It's time for final selections in "Love Lines."

519
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,800
 Which date did you like the most?

520
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,780
 Where are your lines of heart pointing?

521
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,330
Gosh, this isn't even a big deal, but my heart's racing.

522
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,500
Why is it racing?

523
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,130
 Don't you remember...

524
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,010
 Young Shim?

525
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,350
 No. Come to your senses, Oh Young Shim.

526
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,050
 You can't be shaken here.

527
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,700
 If things go wrong and you don't get any votes...

528
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,220
 you'll forever be the pathetic and sorry girl in a song...

529
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,360
 called "Young Shim the Zero Votes."

530
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,030
 No way.

531
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,720
 That bastard, seriously.

532
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:28,610
 But since he still talked like that publicly... isn't there a chance he'll choose me?

533
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,990
 Am I right? Or am I wrong?

534
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,980
 Please press the final selections button.

535
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,960
One moment! One moment, please!

536
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,990
Well, you see...

537
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,790
Wh-What do you think about saying a word or two for the last vote?

538
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,040
Senior, out of nowhere?

539
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,810
I-It's always...

540
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:12,580
important to say your feelings before making the selection...

541
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,780
don't you think?

542
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,770
This isn't a proposal as a participant...

543
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,620
I'm proposing as the PD.

544
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,600
What do you think? Don't you think it's nice?

545
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,830
Let's do that.

546
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,080
All right. I'm in.

547
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,960
Okay.

548
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,800
Sure, then. Since everyone agreed...

549
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,600
everyone will say a thing or two before the final selections.

550
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,250
All right, we're going again.

551
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,440
Ready! Cue!

552
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,170
Pondering is also a waste of time, isn't it?

553
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,990
We're all busy people, so I'll go at once.

554
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,030
I want to...

555
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,660
have a lovely relationship with someone who has a king-size company.

556
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,990
I thought the selection would be easy...

557
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,210
but I'm conflicted to the end.

558
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,640
There's probably no expiration date on first love, right?

559
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,630
That's probably true... since people don't change easily.

560
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,790
First love, so suddenly?

561
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,400
I think memories are powerful.

562
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,520
I'll stay true to my innocent feelings from childhood in making my decision.

563
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,400
As you can see, I'm pretty and capable.

564
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,060
I'm truer to the present than the past, and I'm honest.

565
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,930
All right, now. Please make your final selections.

566
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,780
What the heck are they saying?

567
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,120
What's everyone thinking?

568
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,830
It's a lot more entertaining than I expected.

569
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,050
I was wakened at once earlier.

570
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,580
It's got a suspenseful quality.

571
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,800
Let's just see the results.

572
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,310
 Here are the results of the final selection.

573
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,680
So, you didn't hear anything from Young Shim?

574
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,170
That guy is Wang Kyeong Tae, right?

575
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,660
Gosh, he's not just Wang Kyeong Tae now, Woo Sang.

576
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,040
He's Mark Wang of Kingvely.

577
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,410
- Mark Wang? 
 - Yes.

578
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,410
By the way, who did Young Shim choose?

579
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,310
Gosh, I don't know. There are no spoilers.

580
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,420
Focus.

581
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,440
Hey, I'm not nervous at all, but... what's this trembling feeling?

582
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,650
Gosh, be quiet, for goodness' sake.

583
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,210
Whoa, it's coming out now!

584
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,400

It was Wol Sook who enjoyed a physically fit date.

585
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,420
 First female participant, Jeong Jin, has chosen...

586
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,370

587
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,700
 Kyeong Tae, the Young and Rich.

588
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:42,140
♫  The countless mountains you overcame prove you've been doing great  ♫

589
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,710

590
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,510
 Second male participant, Ho Jae, has chosen...

591
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,970

592
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,270

They say love is like a sudden car accident.

593
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,950
 Jeong Jin, with whom he had a romantic poetry date.

594
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,090
Which part did you like the most?

595
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,410
 Second female participant, Wol Sook, has chosen...

596
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,520

597
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,990
 Kyeong Tae, who showed great competitiveness.

598
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,750

You're so cool!

599
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,200
 So far, Kyeong Tae has received two votes.

600
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,000
 Who did the third female participant, Young Shim, choose?

601
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,940
♫  When someone gives you a nod on your dream  ♫

602
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,850

♪  One means one, not two  ♪

603
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,500
♪  Two means two, not three  ♪

604
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,380
Please sit down.

605
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,730
♪  But rather  ♪

606
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,620

Me, too.

607
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,930
You've read my work, right?

608
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:03,530

609
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,660
♫  Before I met you  ♫

610
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,040
I'm suddenly reminded of back then.

611
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,370
Don't you remember...

612
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,190
Young Shim?

613
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,770

614
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:45,570
 She chose Kyeong Tae, whom she showed a cute love-and-hate chemistry with.

615
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,840
 Wang Kyeong Tae, who received all the votes, where will his love line point to?

616
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,200
 The last line takes off now!

617
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,090
 Wh-What's this? Is it really me?

618
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,740
 He chose Goo Wol Sook, who complimented his good looks.

619
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,620

620
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,310
How embarrassing.

621
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,320
She couldn't even get one line!

622
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,260
It's just as expected.

623
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,120
I thought she just might, but no.

624
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Anyway, I'm worried about Young Shim.

625
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,220
The aftermath will be quite the deal.

626
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,180
Gosh, she's so embarrassing! Oh Young Shim, that ugly duckling!

627
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,790
 "Love Lines" final couple is here.

628
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,830
 Goo Wol Sook and Wang Kyeong Tae, congratulations!

629
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,980
Oh, my.

630
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,110
I think I've seen this scene from somewhere.

631
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,180
 Wang Kyeong Tae...

632
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,180
 Just as I expected, you had a plan all along!

633
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,540
It came out more interesting than I thought.

634
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:25,030

635
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:36,930
♫  Just like how an open gap can't be filled  ♫

636
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,640

637
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,280
 I'm done for.

638
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,240
 Don't you want to join me on a variety show that's on the board right now?

639
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,450
 A variety show?

640
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,290
 Have you worked with PD Oh for a long time?

641
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,220
 Why are you curious about that?

642
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,940
 Now's not the time to be concerned with these things.

643
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,960
 I went out on a show, but why don't I have more new subscribers?

644
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,370
 Let's get along, Young Shim.

645
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,800
 Friendship, my foot!

646
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,690
 Hey, Oh Young Shim, you're in big trouble.

647
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,990
 Okay!

648
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,190
 A head-on breakthrough...
