Thank you.

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:31,860
Sorry.

196
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,640
I just remembered

197
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,720
today is your father's birthday.

198
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,760
It's already a great comfort

199
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,220
that someone still remembers it.

200
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,400
You know what?

201
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,750
When I just took over Teng Yue,

202
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,210
no one had faith in me.

203
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Everyone advised me to give up.

204
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,410
I felt upset every day.

205
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,600
Only when I was here

206
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,850
could I calm down to think.

207
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,790
From now on,

208
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,260
Teng Yue will be different.

209
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,320
Running against the wind.

210
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,750
Beginning with Jiang Hu.

211
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,400
This is what my dad told me.

212
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,970
He always said

213
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,690
a girl

214
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,460
should live a carefree life.

215
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,980
But I think he also wanted to see

216
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,230
when I face challenges,

217
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
I can go against the wind

218
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,400
instead of retreating,

219
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,900
so that I will not disgrace him or the Jiang family.

220
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,490
You've already done a good job.

221
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,020
I will do better.

222
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,530
Let's go.

[Tombs of Father Jiang Qisheng and Mother Pei Zhijian]

225
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,710
You can rest in peace.

226
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
I will take good care of Jiang Hu.

227
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,430
Let's go.

228
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,640
What's so attractive?

229
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,780
Stand properly. Stand properly.

230
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:00,650
Come on.

231
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,610
Smile. Smile. Smile.

232
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,230
Good.

233
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,970
What's so attractive over there?

234
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,920
Ours is the most attractive.

235
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,070
We need to brace ourselves up.

236
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,860
Okay.

237
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,010
Brace ourselves up.

238
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,750
Mr. Zhang.

239
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,130
What do you think?

Jiang Hu can change her name into Jiang Lang.

241
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,050
She is at her wits' end.

242
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,080
Their event is so boring.

243
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,300
I overestimated her.

244
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,880
No matter how good the creativity is,

245
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,510
it's important to have enough budget.

246

It's already noon.

Are we...

250
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,900
going to do it or not?

251
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,369
Xu Si and Jiang Hu are on the way.

252
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,920
They'll be here soon.

253
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,369
Will it be too late?

254
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,270
Whether it's too late or not,

255
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,650
everything goes as planned.

256
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,040
Yes.

257
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,550
Okay.

258
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,069
Tell the staff

259
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,020
to get ready.

260
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,930
Okay.

261
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,660
When do you plan

262
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,580
to tell me the answer to the riddle?

263
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,810
What do you mean?

264
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,150
The event.

265
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,870
Apart from the design style

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,710

268
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,710
you still have a trump card, right?

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,710
What's your purpose

270
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,830
of going to the Studio City?

271
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,440
You'll know soon.

272
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,840
So mysterious.

273
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:40,930
There are really more people

274
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,540
compared with this morning.

275
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,850
Of course.

276
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,620
Otherwise, I wouldn't have decided

277
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,850
to do it at this hour.

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,470
During the lunchtime,

279
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,310
there will be customers

280
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,070
coming here to have lunch.

281
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,420
It's the perfect time to draw public attention.

282
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,310
You're so meticulous.

283
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,420
Look.

284
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,310
Ours is over there.

285
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,430
Yes. Go take a look.

what still remains

is in the public eye

about comfortable shoes I've worn,

313
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,160
I would say I've worn many comfortable shoes.

But Teng Yue's shoes

on the screen,

324
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,380
I was playing

325
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,130
a nameless supporting role.

326
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,460
At that time,

Go.

Let me introduce.

This pair of shoes

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:47,990
Okay.

381
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,020
Do it!

382
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,380
Let me tell you.

383
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,940
The biggest highlight of these shoes

384
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,420
is strong brand influence.
