00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,520
Why are you suddenly so polite to me?

195
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm not used to it.

196
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,680
To be honest,

197
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm getting used to it as well.

198
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
What's wrong with you this time?

199
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,430
I just thought a lot

200
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,590
while waiting for you.

201
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,500
By the way,

202
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,630
did you have a tough day?

203
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,280
Don't tell me you waited for so long

204
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,350
just to show concern for me.

205
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,870
I just think

206
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,340
you have bad days as well

207
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,860
and I should care for you more.

208
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,190
As you said,

209
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,150
adults' relationships

210
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,330
are based on reciprocity.

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,920
Now you're quoting me

212
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,910
to me.

213
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,680
Then how should we achieve reciprocity?

214
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,110
It's very late now.

215
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,110
I guess you're too tired

216
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,080
to think straight

217
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,260
and talk with me.

218
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,000
Can you

219
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,410
give me a little bit of time tomorrow?

220
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,220
I know you're busy.

221
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,090
Your schedule is fully booked

222
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,940
for the next half a month.

223
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,230
I just need you

224
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,430
to give me a moment

225
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,240
between two meetings.

226
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,350
I've sent my proposal

227
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,600
to your work email.

228
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,210
You know my email address?

229
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,070
I asked the receptionist for it.

230
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,470
Looks like

231
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,590
you didn't just sit around the whole day.

232
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,060
You got a lot of information.

233
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,450
As you said,

234
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,560
time is of the essence.

235
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,450
Then when can you…

236
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,900
Let's talk now.

237
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,210
It's already tomorrow.

238
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,150
Hurry up.

[Operation Plan for Reviving Teng Yue]

240
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,350
Teng Yue was founded

241
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,980
in the 1920s

242
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,780
and its products were popular

243
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,710
during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression.

244
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,720
It thrived for nearly a century

245
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,150
and its glory

246
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,070
is deeply engraved

247
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,590
in the memory of every Chinese.

248
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,430
When they recalled Teng Yue,

249
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,820
they all sounded very proud.

250
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,430
Teng Yue was the symbol of that era.

251
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,470
It also carried

252
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,580
our childhood dreams.

253
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,170

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,250
is 1,568.

256
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,350
Netizens have posted

257
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,480
more than one hundred photos

258
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,850
of Teng Yue shoes.

259
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,290
And they were reposted

260
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,790
by 18 KOLs,

261

on TikTok,

263
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,350
Weibo, and Xiaohongshu.

264
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,070
It proves that Teng Yue

265
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,440
hasn't been forgotten

266
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,310
although it's been defunct

267
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,410
for over a decade.

268
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,780
It also proves

269
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,290
that no one can forget

270
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,200
the days of their youth.

271
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,830
That's why I want

272
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,270
to revive Teng Yue.

273
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,550
I can make Teng Yue

274
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,930
back on its feet again.

275
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,060
How do you like

276
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,830
my proposal?

277
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,860
If you were an investor,

278
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,190
how much would you invest

279
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,090
in your project?

280
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,450
I'd invest all my money.

281
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,650
All your money?

282
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,340
It's not like

283
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,580
you have a lot of money.

284
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,760
It seems that you are not satisfied

285
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,250
with my proposal.

286
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,670
It's a fancy proposal,

287
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,470
but branding

288
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,950
is all about the execution.

289
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,400
In Teng Yue's branding plan,

290
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,839
there is no team

291
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,319
and no distribution channel.

292
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,720
There isn't even a product.

293
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,310
So I need a factory

294
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,150
and more time

295
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,230
to build distribution channels,

296
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,760
put together a team, and make products.

297
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,310
Who will be on your team?

298
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,230
What kind of distribution channel?

299
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,310
What sort of product?

300
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,230
Teng Yue still has

301
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,510
a group of veteran workers

302
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,300

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,000
had 30 years

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,990
of management experience in this industry

306
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,820
and a talented design team.

307
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,880
Put together your team.

308
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,390
No problem.

309
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,220
Sell those 20,000 pairs of shoes in the inventory.

310
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,350
You have one month.

311
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,790
Why are you laughing?

312
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,670
I'm surprised that you're still

313
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,350
obsessed with those 20,000 pairs of shoes.

314
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,270
What?

315
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,210
Do you regret it now?

316
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,220
You don't want to rent the factory to me?

317
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,070
It's because

318
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,530
I'm taking your words seriously

319
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,790
that I'm asking you

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,100

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,330
Show me that Teng Yue

322
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,700
does have distribution channels.

doubt my sincerity.

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,310
Just make do with it.

386
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,750
Take it.

387
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,620
Do workers eat such food too?

388
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,100
No.

389
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,420
The workers don't get to

390
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,510
eat so many dishes.

391
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,410
You're serving this kind of food

392
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,770
with a limited supply?

393
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,580
What's the problem?

394
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,950
They only pay 500 yuan

395
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,240
for food every month.

396
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,670
What do you expect me to serve?

397
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,650
Besides, they don't work

398
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,040
yet we're still offering them food.

399
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,850
They should be grateful.

400
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,690
But…

401
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,440
No buts.

402
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,120
What you should worry about now

403
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,600
is how to sell

404
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,270
those 20,000 pairs of shoes.

405
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,660
Eat up. Think later.

406
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,320
Uncle.

407
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,920
Ask Ren Bing,

408
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,670
Yue Shan, Zhou Chunhong,

409
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,240
Fan Chuan, Jiang Shengquan, Huang Siqi,

410
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,750
and He Bi

411
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,470
out for dinner for me.

412
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,990
Invite everyone in C Club.

413
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,060
They…

414
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
They're the heads

415
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,100
of Free Unicorn's Marketing, Sales, and Purchasing Department,

416
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,370
chief designers,

417
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,230
and regional managers.

418
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,360
Why do you want to meet them?

419
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,240
Most of them

420
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,750
work for Zhang Wenshan now.

421
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,860
I'll try to recruit them for Teng Yue.

422
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,430
Recruit them?

423
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,370
You can't afford it.

424
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,190
When they

425
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,000
worked for your dad back then,

426
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,920
do you know how much their salaries were a year?

427
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,210
Can you afford it?

428
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,640
Besides,

429
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,710
Zhang Wenshan is rich

430
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,790
and you're poor.

431
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,700
They're not blind.

432
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,320
It's an easy choice.

433
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,060
I know.

434
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,730
But I have to give it a try.

435
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,350
I can't give up without trying.

436
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,390
Fine.

437
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,700
Give it a try if you insist.

438
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,430
But

439
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,430
you don't have to

440
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,340
invite them to such an expensive restaurant.

441
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,300
What a waste of money.

442
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,550
I still have money

443
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,730
on my membership card there.

444
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,600
I can't redeem it for cash.

445
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,670
So I might as well

446
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,460
make the best use of it.

447
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,440
You have a point.

448
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,500
By the way,

449
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,470
my dad gave you

450
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,880
a few bottles of Moutai, right?

451
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,630
Bring them

452
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,470
to the dinner.

453
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,280
Only

454
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,960
one and a half bottles are left.

455
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,990
Bring them to the dinner.

456
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,880
Why…

457
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,390
Why is the food so salty?

458
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
Too much salt.

459
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,340
I'll talk to the cook.

460
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,190
Too salty, right?

461
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,890
I'll go talk to the cook.

462
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,840
My hat.

463
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,060
Stingy.

464
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,310
Hello.

465
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,830
This is Aneda Chaobei Store.

466
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,990
I'm calling to ask

467
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,750
when Mr. Fang will come for a visit next week.

468
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,170
We want to make preparations in advance.

469
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,720
Sure. No problem.

470
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,470
Okay.

471
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,380
I've arranged it.

472
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,370
Okay.

473
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,470
Have a good day.

474
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,940
Bye.

475
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,330
[Plus-size Clothing for Women]

476
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,890
This is the place?

477
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,970
You...

478
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,680
Did you get the address right?

479
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,840
Yes.

480
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,880
It's here.

481
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,390
Really?

482
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,450
There's such a good house

483
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,300
near us?

484
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,930
This is wonderful.

485
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,230
I've never lived

486
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,550
in such a good house before.

487
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,470
Here.

488
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,550
Come on.

489
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,120
Hurry up.

490
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,350
Bring me my suitcase.

491
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,020
Great.

492
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,370
The scenery is wonderful.

493
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,380
I love the lights.

494
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,710
This kind of house

495
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,600
is where an elegant woman like me should live.

496
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
This is the kind of house

497
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,990
you like?

498
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,750
How about I take out a loan

499
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,000
and buy you a house like this?

500
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,270
This is not your house after all.

501
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,710
Your boss can use it to keep you under his thumb.

502
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,230
Living here

503
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,910
is convenient for me

504
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,020
to make videos.

505
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,890
Daughter, Jian.

506
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,960
Look at me.

507
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,550
I'm graceful, aren't I?

508
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,030
Guess I have to

509
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,910
call my girl friends right away

510
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,660
to invite them over for a cup of tea.

511
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,520
Mom, don't do that.

512
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,920
My company rented this place.

513
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,370
It can be taken back anytime.

514
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,240
Then you have to work hard.

515
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,470
If I get used to

516
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,710
living in such a house,

517
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,560
it'll be hard to change that habit.

518
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,560
I can't guarantee that.

519
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,510
Zhaoyang.

520
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,960
You reminded me.

521
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,240
I know

522
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,510
I should make my own money

523
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,960
and rely on no one but myself.

524
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,390
So, I think…

525
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,840
You want to buy stocks again?

526
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,440
No way.

527
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,230
I don't have money.

528
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,880
It's lucrative for sure this time.

529
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,280
There's a guy

530
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,990
called Xu Si

531
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,310
in your company, right?

532
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,720
He

533
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,530
was on the financial news.

534
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,990
The host said he's great

535
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,050
at investing.

536
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,430
Meet him in private.

537
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,440
Ask him which stocks to buy.

538
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,320
Then we'll be rich.

539
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,150
Why would he help me?

540
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,600
You work for him.

541
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,130
Besides,

542
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,220
you're pretty and single.

543
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,680
Mom, what are you talking about?

544
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,660
If you need money, I can give you some.

545
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,710
Besides, even Warren Buffet

546
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,710
lost money sometimes.

547
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,190
You're giving that guy too much credit.

548
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,750
Don't say anything like that again.

549
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,190
Look at you two.

550
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,590
You get grumpy whenever I mention stocks.

551
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,380
How can you become rich?

552
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,400
Forget it.

553
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,680
I'll go check upstairs.

554
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,470
I can't wait to see the rest of my house.

555
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,790
It's a mansion.

556
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,150
I need to walk slowly.

557
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,920
Look at her.

558
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,010
I guess

559
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,830
she'll be that way her whole life.

560
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,080
You've been busy all morning.

561
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,660
Go take a rest.

562
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,870
Leave the rest to me.

563
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,370
No, thanks.

564
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,140
You can leave now.

565
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,660
I've moved out anyway.

566
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,410
I have to do everything myself.

567
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,370
Even if you've moved out,

568
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,720
I'm still your brother.

569
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Just like before,

570
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,750
I'll come by every other day

571
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,390
to cook for you

572
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,230
and do the cleaning.

573
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,900
You just need to focus on painting.

574
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,580
Boss.

575
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,470

00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,140
I've done the math.

767
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,690
Neither Jingyang nor Baoxing

768
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,900
is big enough to handle

769
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,120
the Aneda case alone.

770
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,360
Instead of

771
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,780
fighting over it

772
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,810
and letting someone else

773
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,790
take advantage of us,

774
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,830
we should

775
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,480
join hands

776
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,850
to maximize the profit margins.

777
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,250
It's my pleasure to work with you.

778
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,870
The pleasure is mine.

779
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:32,950
Jiang Hu.

780
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,270
I think

781
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,020
your idea is great.

782
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,120
In terms of marketing,

783
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,790
you're much more visionary

784
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,670
and creative

785
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,500
than old marketing people

786
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,600
like me.

787
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,470
Since you like Jiang Hu's idea,

788
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,210
come to work with her.

789
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,190
What do you say?

790
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,150
Come on.

791
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,050
Cheers.

792
00:39:59,390 --> 00:39:59,900
Come on.

793
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:00,920
Here.

794
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,600
Actually,

795
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,150
I, Chunhong,

796
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,470
Fan Chuan, and the others

797
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,830
are still working in Free Unicorn

798
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,460
because we haven't forgotten

799
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,760
Mr. Jiang.

800
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,310
We don't want Free Unicorn

801
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,380
to go under just like this.

802
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,870
Mr. Wenshan who took over it

803
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,430
also aims at

804
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,590
making Free Unicorn thrive.

805
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,010
I'm afraid I can't agree with you

806
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,900
on that.

807
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,360
Jiang Hu.

808
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,870
It's not easy to run a business.

809
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,900
You may think

810
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,460
we're a bunch of rubes

811
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,830
who are old-fashioned

812
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,510
in our business ideas.

813
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,520
But

814
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,880
in the market,

815
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,150
what we have

816
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,670
is experience

817
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,990
gained through real-world battles.

818
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,690
You shouldn't

819
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,720
have said that.

820
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,990
It sounded a bit harsh.

821
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,790
Look.

822
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,070
The others didn't show up tonight,

823
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,850
not because they've forgotten Mr. Jiang

824
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,400
or wanted to embarrass you.

825
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,540
It's just that

826
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,790
without Mr. Jiang as the backbone,

827
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
to be honest with you,

828
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,550
we don't have faith

829
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,320
in your abilities.

830
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,480
Mr. Wenshan

831
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,430
is different.

832
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
After graduating from college,

833
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,170
he worked in different departments

834
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,130
for many years.

835
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,100
He has experience

836
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,630
and credentials.

837
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,490
Jiang Hu.

838
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,840
Take my advice.

839
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,710
Stop wasting your time.

840
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,100
Ren Bing.

841
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,040
You didn't have to come

842
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,590
if you didn't want to.

843
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:58,870
You're

844
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,750
full of crap.

845
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,470
You know that?

846
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,990
Uncle.

847
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,870
Mr. Ren.

848
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,400
I want to thank you for my dad.

849
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,270
For him,

850
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,950
you're still working in Free Unicorn

851
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:14,990
and making contributions.

852
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:21,860
Don't drink it.

853
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,550
That's my wine.

854
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,100
Put it down.

855
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,800
Put it down.

856
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,340
You don't deserve it.

857
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,480
Put it down. Put it down.

858
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,010
How could he?

859
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,680
What a jerk.
