I have my own rules for livestreams.

382
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,440
Are you questioning me?

383
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,190
Besides,

384
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,430
hosts shouldn't wear masks.

385
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,840
Should the audience

386
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,350
look at the products in my hands

387
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,290
or the mask on your face by then?

388
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,710
Replace her.

389
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,670
If you work with me,

390
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,740
you can't change the designated plan at will.

391
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,750
I don't care if she's wearing a mask or not.

392
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,860
You two must

393
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,970
livestream together.

394
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,950
Now that you've accepted the Free Unicorn's business activity,

395
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,920
you should consider for our brand whole-heartedly.

396
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,120
I've never met

397
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,550
a Party A as arrogant as you.

398
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,040
You only have two options now.

399
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,480
Either livestream as planned,

400
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,570
or leave.

401
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,550
Among the 50 influencers who came here today,

I'm the only top influencer, right?

403
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,310
Ms. Jiang, do you know

404
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,360
what's the impact to

405
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,800
the effect and sales of the livestream

406
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,110
if I leave?

407
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,830
Can you find anyone else now?

408
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,720
I don't know.

409
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,670
Because it doesn't matter at all.

410
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,970
In this world,

411
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,790
no one is irreplaceable.

412
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,800
Let's wait and see.

413
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Since she's gone,

414
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
you don't have to stay here, either.

415
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,920
Hello?

416
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,050
Hello?

417
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,670
Everyone,

418
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,780
you've seen

419
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,990
what happened just now.

420
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,540
You should be very clear

421
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,840
about the sales of

422
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,350
Momo Sakura's livestream last night.

423
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,650
Her commission is

424
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,360
over ten percent.

425
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,100
I believe

426
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,550
this is the performance you want to achieve

427
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,990
even in your dreams.

428
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,310
But at this moment,

429
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,830
you must be thinking,

430
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,030
"I'm not a top influencer

431
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,910
like Momo Sakura.

432
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,310
I don't have that kind of chance."

433
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,090
That's because

434
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,070
before she became popular,

435
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,810
she seized

436
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,200
the opportunity you missed.

437
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,270
Today,

438
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,630
I'll give

439
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,020
the opportunity you once missed

happened to the top influencer

But I'm wondering

481
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,630
why Free Unicorn and Aneda

482
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,070
make it to trending topics together?

483
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,350
Is the influencer designer from Aneda

484
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,310
really that popular?

485
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,070
It costs money to be on the trending search.

486
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,550
That young woman boss

487
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,390
is really rich and willful.

488
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,910
And she's quite manipulative.

489
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,350
She's indeed calculating.

After you showed your face today,

495
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,560
you made to the trending searches right away.

Unless something unexpected happens,

518
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,780
Aneda will most probably fire you

519
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,650
by the reason that you were against the competition agreement.

520
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,340

why you are so arrogant.

Everything you have

534
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,510

536
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,350
allow you to do everything you want

537
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,570

541
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,070

548
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,610

553
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,150
creates a good opportunity.

557
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,310
Yes, let's go.

I saw the sales tonight.

571
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,530
They're going to exceed 50 million soon.

572
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,270
Congratulations to you, too.

573
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,390
The followers of your Weibo account

574
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,560
have exceeded 12 million, right?

575
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,990
The traffic you earned today

576
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,120
is the total amount of three months.

577
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,590
The data for the livestream tomorrow will hit a new record.

578
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,750
Thank you for guiding me, Ms. Jiang.

579
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,530
Come on.

580
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,240
Cheers to our win-win situation.

581
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,630
That illustrator

582
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,100
was also good at acting.

583
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,310
Her?

584
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,690
She was not acting.

585
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,920
It seems

586
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,070
we cooperated really well.

587
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,590
We have a tacit understanding between good friends.

588
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,160
Cheers.

589
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,470
We just cooperated well.

590
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,990
That's all.

591
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,680
I'll be off now.

592
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,720
Suit yourself.

593
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,860
You could remove her mask,

594
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,280
but you shouldn't have slapped her in the face.

What a cheesy pickup line.

607
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,030
I don't have time for you.

608
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,670
Let me put it another way.

609
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,070
The daughter of the boss of Free Unicorn, Jiang Hu,

610
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,040
and the influencer host Momo Sakura

611
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,900
performed a play in which the influencer refused to livestream

612
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,870
in Teng Yue's workshop

613
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,150
this afternoon.

614
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,630
It went on quite a few charts of trending searches.

615
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,750
Amazing.

616
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,560
You're so good at acting.

617
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,070
Are you interested in being an actress?

618
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,080
Can you say something new?

619
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,310
It's already very effective.

620
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,590
At least I've got your attention.

621
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,080
What do you want?

622
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,730

Don't you know anything?

692
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,570
Should the audience

00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,990
look at the products in my hands

694
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,020

Since she's gone,

698
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,630
you don't have to stay here, either.

699
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,430
That's right.

700
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,690
You're absolutely right.

701
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,910
But this time,

702
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,420
the appearance fee

703
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,910
should be more.

704
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,310

710
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,800
Why didn't you say hello to me?

711
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,830
How rude!

712
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,160
Something's wrong.

713
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,740

It's her first time to go to work.

770
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,730
She'll need something nice to feel confident.

771

00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,840
Morning.

777
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,370
Morning.

778
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,380
These shoes don't look good.
