After that individual business owner was arrested,

00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,759
the police followed the clues

7
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,020
and found Gao Zheng.

8
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,479
Your dad never thought

that his most trusted friend

10
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,460
would be involved in embezzlement.

because of his connection with Gao Zheng.

He didn't complain at all.

00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,870
He sold all his assets

17
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,310

for me to decide to ask you for another favor.

65

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,770
that if anything happens,

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,710

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,790
I don't want to go to Nanjing University anymore.

195
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,660
Why?

196
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,750
Are you being willful again?

197
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,440
I don't want others to think

198
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,560
that I got the guaranteed admission

199
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,110
because my dad

200
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,710
is the sponsor of Nanjing University's Scholarship.

201
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,300
Is that all?

202
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,610
Yes.

203
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,350
It's spread all over the school.

204
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,590
Now, no one thinks

205
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,570
the exam is fair.

206
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,510
It's unfair to me.

207
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,990
But it's even more unfair to others.

208
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,230
Jiang Hu.

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,180
In this world,

210
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,380
there's no absolute fairness.

211
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,970
All right.

212
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,890
Since you don't want to go to Nanjing University,

213
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,110
then don't go.

214
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:58,870
Why didn't you

215
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,290
explain to her properly?

216
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,420
This is not the only emotional entanglement

217
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,870
between Zhaoyang and me.

218
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,100
How can I explain everything properly?

219
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,840
Your personalities and tempers

220
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
are matched.

221
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,830
If Zhaoyang

222
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,450
were born in a family like you,

223
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,990
I guess she'd have already become

224
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,180
a famous designer.

225
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,470
You have no idea

226
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,680
how much she likes design.

227
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,230
Oh, right.

228
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,110
I have other photos

229
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,470
of her designs in my phone.

230
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,050
Here, take a look.

231
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,510
She's free now.

232
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,650
She's just drawing shoes.

233
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,750
What do you think? Decent, right?

234
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,640
So,

235
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,510
you've been blaming me.

236
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,950
That's why you didn't agree

237
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,200
to cooperate with me long-term.

238
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,540
I just wanted to think it through

239
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,050
and give you a clear answer.

240
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,060
Only in this way

241
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,160
can I be

242
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,360
accountable to you, Zhaoyang,

243
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,410
my comrades, and myself.

244
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,270
Do you have the answer now?

245
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,020
Yang.

246
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,610
We've known each other for a long time.

247
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,070
What do you think about

248
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,310
how I do business?

249
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,720
What do you think

250
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,770
about me as a person?

251
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,150
Well...

252
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,460
I'll give you all of Teng Yue's

253
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,290
online business to you.

254
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,330
Two plus three.

255
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,760
Two years later,

256
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,890
if you still think

257
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,880
I'm decent at doing business

258
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,860
and that I'm a decent person,

259
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,000
we can extend it for three years.

260
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,240
What do you think?

261
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,020
Selling 20,000 pairs of shoes in a month

262
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,750
is my starting point

263
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,630
and Teng Yue's starting point.

264
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,970
I want to make these shoes

265
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,230
get back into the top ten in the industry

266
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,850
and create a Chinese market.

267
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,790
I want every Chinese family

268
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,350
to have a pair of Teng Yue shoes.

269
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,030
Just like 30 years ago.

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,640

271
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,280
Trust me.

as long as I decide to do something,

274
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,950
I will do it.

275
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,400
I want the 100-year-old Teng Yue

276
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,750

360
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,080
Then, as for the fee...

361
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,320
All members in my team

362
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,680
are designers who've studied

363
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,440
abroad.

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,840
So the fee

367
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,000
comes with certain requirements and a definite threshold.

368
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,760
It's 120,000 per single product design.

can

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,640
from the waist-up in the industry.

381
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,430
We haven't delved into

382
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,840
providing services to companies

383
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,910
with an annual sales target

384
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,130
below a million yuan yet.

385
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,329
Jiang Hu.

386
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,030
Why are you here?

387
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,339
Are you here to talk about cooperating with design services?

388
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,079
What else could I be doing

389
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,530
at a design company?

390
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,130
Congratulations.

391
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,500
It seems that you're

392
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,470
running Teng Yue quite well.

393
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,020
You can already work with

394
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,410
a high-end company that's costly.

395
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
Zhang Wenshan.

396
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,480
Stop being sarcastic.

397
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,100
Why?

398
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,500
Did the agreement fall through?

399
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,710
You haven't changed at all.

400
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,440
You never look for your faults.

401
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,520
Now that you're doing business yourself,

402
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,830
you should understand the difficulties.

403
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,550
I've introduced

404
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,190
quite a bit of business

405
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,190
to this company before.

406
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,820
I can put in a good word for you.

407
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,870
I only remember

408
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,120
that when you said

409
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,380
you wanted to help me the last time,

410
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,820
I almost lost everything.

411
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,220
How dare I

412
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,720
request for your services again?

413
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,400
Come check out Free Unicorn when you have time.

414
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,640
I'll treat you to a meal.

415
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,070
Huang Xiaolin?

416
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,410
Ms. Jiang?

417
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,390
Why are you...

418
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,390
I didn't delay

419
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,690
our factory's work.

420
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,750
Our factory

421
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,710
has so little work to do.

422
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,950
I already finished everything in the morning.

423
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,420
Is there anyone else in our factory

424
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,800
who works two jobs like you?

425
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,150
How would I know

426
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,990
about others' affairs?

427
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,880
Please hurry up.

428
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,910
Okay, right away.

429
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,950
But you...

430
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,800
Ms. Jiang.

431
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,580
I have no choice.

432
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,670
Our salary

433
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,190
is not half as much as last month.

434
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,750
I have no choice, right?

435
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,860
Please.

436
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,840
Thank you.

437
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,310
Take it.

438
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,950
I'm running out of time.

439
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,510
I have to go.

440
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,130
I've reconciled the accounts with Mr. Pei

441
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,220
and reduced all fixed costs.

442
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,620
Without

443
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,040
regular income,

444
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,360
I'm afraid...

445
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,910
We can't hold on any longer.

446
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,550
I know.

447
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,400
The funding problem

448
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,840
is indeed our biggest

449
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,850
problem.

450
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,840
If we get a loan from the bank,

451
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,050
with our production ability and production value,

452
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,580
there may be some problems.

453
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,410
Back then, Teng Yue

454
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,530
was the OEM of Free Unicorn.

455
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,400
Was it also because

456
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,590
it couldn't hold on anymore?

457
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,350
Your father and mother

458
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,150
were planning to

459
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,140
expand Free Unicorn

460
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,720
and then use it to revive Teng Yue.

461
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,990
But it never got accomplished,

462
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,040
right?

463
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,010
Teng Yue's shoes in Teng Yue Factory

464
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,540
became more and more sidelined.

465
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,150
The assembly line in Teng Yue Factory

466
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,260
began making Free Unicorn's casual shoes,

467
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,210
and it lasted until now?

468
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,310
Why are you suddenly asking this?

469
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,960
At 4:30 p.m.,

470
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,700
we still have a meeting

471
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,000
with FW.

472
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,840
Call Jiang Hu over

473
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,700
for the meeting.

474
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,200
Wait, Boss.

475
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,630
If you really want to fire her,

476
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,610
you shouldn't blatantly provoke her

477
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,380
like this.

478
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,520
According to her personality,

479
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,890
she'll jump off the building again.

480
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,500
It's risky.

481
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,390
If she jumped off the building,

482
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,460
she'll find a scapegoat.

483
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,010
If you don't want to be the scapegoat,

484
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,580
give me your resignation letter.

485
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,130
What?

486
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

487
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,270
It's natural that I run errands for you.

488
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:54,930
I'll go now.

489
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,950
Who are you looking for?

490
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,950
I’m looking for Mr. Zhang.

491
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,110
Do you have an appointment?

492
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,460
Ms. Jiang doesn’t need to register.

493
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,370
Mr. Zhang.

494
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Park her bike.

495
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,240
Okay.

496
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,420
You wouldn't be here for no reason.

497
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,610
Have you forgotten?

498
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,410
You invited me

499
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,470
here.

500
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,650
Of course I haven't forgotten.

501
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,430
Let's go.

502
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,840
I'll show you around.

503
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,520
How is it?

504
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,900
Nothing has changed, right?

505
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,080
I wanted you to examine

506
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,350
the current Free Unicorn.

507
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,670
Mr. Zhang.

508
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,550
Mr. Zhang.

509
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,050
Mr. Zhang.

510
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,940
Mr. Jiang.

511
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,750
Speak properly.

512
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,210
It's Zhang,

513
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,100
not Jiang.

514
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,410
Say it.

515
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,420
Mr. Zhang.

516
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,260
I put all my energy

517
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,200
into Free Unicorn.

518
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,110
Look.

519
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,440
The design department has expanded into an entire floor.

520
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,450
Over there,

521
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,240
that's the designer

522
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,300
I hired from Italy.

523
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,010
Next year's spring design...

524
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,270
will definitely sell well.

525
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,120
Mr. Zhang.

526
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,950
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

527
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,710
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

528
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,790
Sit down.

529
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm really serious

530
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,270
about running Free Unicorn.

531
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,030
Unlike Gao Yi.

532
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,100
He was raised by your family.

533
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,670
But after your dad left,

534
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,620
he immediately added insult to injury...

535
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,920
Can you not mention Gao Yi?

536
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,130
Okay.

537
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,120
Come to my office.

538
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,100
Here. Have a seat.

539
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,280
Jiang Hu.

540
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,700
I've already guessed your intention.

541
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,830
It's about Teng Yue.

542
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,580
Free Unicorn's canvas shoe

543
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,240
has always been

544
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,830
made by Teng Yue.

545
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,410
The production and quality

546
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,540
have been stable over the past decade.

547
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,340
If both sides continue to cooperate,

548
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,950
it'll be worth it

549
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,480
for both you and me.

550
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,650
Of course.

551
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,070
Teng Yue is an old OEM

552
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,150
of Free Unicorn.

553
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,190
If we continue to cooperate,

554
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,480
I have no problem

555
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,860
about the procedure.

556
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,690
But...

557
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,090
But what?

558
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,870
I showed the report

559
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,320
to my dad and the board.

560
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,230
They all said

561
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,420
that your dad still overvalued Teng Yue.

562
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,100
The OEM fee is too high.

563
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,180
The average price of a pair

564
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,840
of Free Unicorn's casual shoes is 199 yuan.

565
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,290
Teng Yue also conscientiously

566
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,480
adhere to Free Unicorn's requirements

567
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,270
for the craftsmanship and fabric

568
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,020
in our production.

569
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,540
And over the years,

570
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,680
the cost price has been maintained

571
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,610
at about 28 yuan

572
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,580
without fluctuations.

573
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,370
It guarantees that Free Unicorn

574
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,680
gets 85% of the gross profit.

575
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,550
I don't think

576
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,710
this is too high a cost.

577
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,770
If you can reduce it further,

578
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,360
how about a 20% discount?

579
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,650
For a month's work,

580
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,130
I'll give you no less than 100,000 pairs.

581
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,350
Zhang Wenshan.

582
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,630
At 28 yuan,

583
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,470
we're already

584
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,900
absorbing the inflation of the raw materials.

585
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,890
So you do feel pressured.

586
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,680
If you're pressured,

587
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,680
you can choose

588
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,830
not to do business with us.

589
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,000
I can go to Southeast Asia

590
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,950
and find an OEM.

591
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,940
There is policy support there

592
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,090
and the labor is cheaper.

593
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,000
Fine.

594
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,350
Then we don't have to talk any further.

595
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,560
[Ziyouqi Group]

596
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,990
Hello, Wu Guanglei. Go ahead.

597
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:57,390
[Teng Yue's Operations Proposal]

598
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,230
Mr. Xu.

599
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,390
Let's start.

600
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,930
Teng Yue's Operations Proposal.

601
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,280
Firstly,

602
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,820
I think Teng Yue Shoes'

603
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,130
biggest problem now

604
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,070
is that it needs to

605
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,330
expand and reinforce its publicity.

606
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,620
On the premise

607
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,970
of retaining the domestic export

608
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,780
corporate culture,

609
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,510
we need to increase its international influence.

610
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,890
What should we do?

611
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,770
This is our direction.

612
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,230
International popularity will help boost local popularity.

613
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,910
We're going to designate

614
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,070
the four fashion weeks in

615
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,220
New York, London,

616
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,500
Paris, and Milan

617
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,150
as our marketing focus.

618
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,050
But unlike before,

619
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,490
we won't invest the same amount of effort

620
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,360
in each of these four fashion weeks.

621
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,140
We'll base it on the data feedback

622
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,860
of our brand during these fashion weeks

623
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
and adjust our marketing efforts

624
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,590
and strategies accordingly.

625
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:35,680
Within one year,

626
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,520
or even shorter,

627
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,320
I believe

628
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,500
that we can revive this brand

629
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,340
back to its past glory.

630
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:41,880
Alex.

631
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,100
Introduce the design.

632
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,400
We need to retain

633
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,890
Teng Yue's basic retro style.

634
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,790
Under Teng Yue's new system,

635
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,310
we'll also gradually

636
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,310
advance and integrate with the trends

637
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,190
to sell better designs.

638
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,310
These

639
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,940
are our design concepts.

640
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,640
Everyone,

641
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,400
thank you for your hard work today.

642
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,600
It's my duty.

643
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,930
If there's any news over there,

644
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,060
I'll let you know immediately.

645
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,070
If there's any problem,

646
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,470
please communicate it right away.

647
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,490
Okay, no problem.

648
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,880
Okay, thank you.

649
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,710
Thank you. I hope we can

650
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,560
work together.

651
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,170
Of course.

652
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,880
Keep in touch.

653
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,670
The founder of FW,

654
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,690
Alan,

655
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,950
has a background in e-commerce.

656
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,790
The designer Alex

657
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,710
has won the British Design Grand Award before.

658
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,490
After hearing everything,

659
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,230
what did you learn?

660
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,630
Teng Yue's top priority now

661
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,340
is its product.

662
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,320
To develop new products,

663
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,220
we need to improve

664
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,640
the designs, marketing efforts,

665
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,740
and availability of sales distribution channels.

666
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,180
I can't do that, but they can.

667
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,660
Anything else?

668
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,870
Everything is based on

669
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,050
the basis that one has money.

670
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,660
I don't have money, but they do.

671
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,760
What else?

672
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,430
Xu Si.

673
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,710
Is it really impossible

674
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,990
for you to wait for a quarter of the year?

675
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,630
You can't wait to replace me now?

676
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,350
It's past work time.

677
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,820
I think you're hungry.

678
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,300
Let's go eat first.

679
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,510
Do you think I'm in the mood to eat?

680
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,460
Stop with your

681
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,390
hypocritical courtesy.

682
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,070
I just hope

683
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,170
that you can wait for me for another quarter of the year.

684
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,150
Okay?

685
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,650
I'll get going.

686
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,950
Zhang Wenshan.

687
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,120
It's me, Jiang Hu.

688
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,260
Have you made up your mind?

689
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,290
22 yuan.

690
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,150
You can't provide

691
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,310
less than 100,000 pairs for a month's work.

692
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
Nice.

693
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,830
I'll give you the contract tomorrow.

694
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,960
On one condition.

695
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,030
Free Unicorn has to pay

696
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,350
50% of the payment in advance.

697
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,070
The final payment has to be paid

698
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,330
within five working days after the goods are delivered.

699
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,630
When Free Unicorn and Teng Yue worked together,

700
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,630
payments were always done annually.

701
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,700
Let's not change the old rules.

702
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,190
The cost of labor in Southeast Asia is low,

703
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,070
but in order for Free Unicorn

704
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,150
to find a suitable and familiar

705
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,220
OEM factory

706
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,190
in a short time,

707
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,400
you can calculate

708
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,220
the time and communication costs yourself.

709
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,990
We can talk again

710
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,750
after you're done with your calculations.

711
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,730
Okay.

712
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,100
Since you're so decisive,

713
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,400
it'd be disrespectful of me

714
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,390
to not agree to it.

715
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,560
Xu Si, what are you doing?

716
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
What are you doing?

717
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,140
What are you doing?

718
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,660
Let go of me.

719
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm hungry.

720
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,820
That's none of my business.

721
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:31,990
Do you know

722
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,470
why I called you here today?

723
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,190
Isn't humiliating me

724
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,320
your hobby?

725
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,010
What do you want to eat?

726
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,370
You decide.

727
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,540
Sorry.

728
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,350
For what?

729
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,600
Last time, in my office,

730
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,780
I went too far.

731
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,320
Only last time?

732
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,630
And this time.

733
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,240
I'm sorry.

734
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,500
Being able to

735
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,800
be keenly aware of your mistakes

736
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,730
is your strength.

737
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,460
This time, you called

738
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,830
FW over to make an operations proposal

739
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,220
for Teng Yue because

740
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,070
you're trying

741
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,180
to help me broaden my business ideas,

742
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,920
right?

743
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,930
I just praised you,

744
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,830
and now you're flattering me?

745
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,940
Am I wrong?

746
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,450
If you can't accomplish

747
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,560
the KPI for

748
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,320
Teng Yue's first quarter,

749
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,840
they can still replace you.

750
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,680
Although they have

751
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,880
advantages that I can't attain,

752
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,200
there's a huge problem

753
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,100
with their proposal.

754
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,670
International popularity will help boost local popularity.

755
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,330
It's a great concept.

756
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,800
But it doesn't suit Teng Yue.

757
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,310
How so?

758
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,260
Their creative idea

759
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,110
doesn't leave any room for Teng Yue's DNA

760
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,010
or Teng Yue's memories.

761
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,650
What Teng Yue needs now

762
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,180
is a product

763
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,820
to awaken the consumers’ nostalgia,

764
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,540
not a product that abandons history.

765
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,560
Are you saying

766
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,320
that FW doesn't understand

767
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,460
Teng Yue like you do?

768
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:20,920
Yes.

769
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,100
Besides,

770
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,490
I know more about shoes than them.

771
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,520
You don't know how to be modest.

772
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,990
I'm just saying it as it is.

773
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,420
Look at their proposal.

774
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,520
Most of it

775
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,090
is just replicating what Western brands do.

776
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,040
It's too westernized.

777
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,840
There's no

778
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,470
integration with Teng Yue at all.

779
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,370
I don't think

780
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,280
they can help Teng Yue

781
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,270
continue to develop.

782
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,500
I'm only concerned with

783
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,160
what you'll do next.

784
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,330
Next week,

785
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,880
Teng Yue will start

786
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,450
taking orders from Free Unicorn as its OEM.

787
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,160
The monthly sales is 2.2 million.

788
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,740
Did you beg Zhang Wenshan?

789
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,350
He and I

790
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
just based it on the current

791
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,640
situation

792
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,890
and agreed upon a cooperation

793
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,160
that both parties can accept.

794
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,590
We only talked business.

795
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,590
Just like how I talk business with you.

796
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,210
So there's no begging

797
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,200
involved.

798
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm

799
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,430
already used to

800
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,890
how sharp-tongued you are.

801
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,390
I don't mind that.

802
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,400
But I have to remind you

803
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,110
that while maintaining Teng Yue's old business

804
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,330
is not a problem,

805
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,550
the key to reviving Teng Yue

806
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,540
is not in working as an OEM.

807
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,530
I understand.

808
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,620
I have basically completed the reorganization

809
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,900
of Teng Yue's operations proposal.

810
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,920
I'll also start recruiting designers as soon as possible.

811
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,870
I have also come up with

812
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,350
a way to tide Teng Yue over

813
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,620
temporarily in terms of sales.

814
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,900
I'll show you the effect

815
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,900
of my operations proposal

816
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,180
after it's implemented.

817
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,140
You want to use actual execution

818
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,320
to compete with

819
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,500
FW's proposal?

820
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,440
It'll be convenient for you

821
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,510
to compare the return of investment.

822
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,850
Eat up. You're hungry.

823
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,280
This is yours.

824
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,320
Sister Wang, this is yours.

825
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,770
I'll put it here.

826
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,330
You can't live without your phone?

827
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,960
Watch your behavior during work hours.

828
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,639
Keep it.

829
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,020
I've arranged everything in terms of my work.

830
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,100
Master.

831
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,730
The work volume last year

832
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,800
was twice to three times greater than what it is now.

833
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,870
I did my work perfectly then.

834
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,010
Look at the minute amount now.

835
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,710
It's not even enough to fill the gaps between my teeth.

836
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,090
Master Zhang.

837
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,030
Jun.

838
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,730
It's just right that you're all here.

839
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,760
I have something to say.

840
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,900
About what?

841
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,070
I heard

842
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,380
that our salary this month

843
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,180
will still be according to the fixed salary

844
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,020
and not proportionate to the workload, right?

845
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
I know Teng Yue hasn't had much work

846
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,120
these past few months.

847
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,000
I understand.

848
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,470
But look,

849
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,930
there's a lot of work now.

850
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,080
I'm agile

851
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,140
and good at my work.

852
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,240
For what?

853
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,000
The more I work, the less I earn.

854
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,250
If that's the case,

855
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,690
I'd rather not be making Teng Yue's shoes.

856
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,700
Cut it out.

857
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,550
Well, you have to give us an explanation.

858
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:32,980
Jun.

859
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,030
Say something. Everyone's waiting.

860
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,610
You...

861
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,640
You don't get paid enough.

862
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,510
Don't look at me.

863
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,660
I'm not in charge.

864
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,800
Who should you be looking for?

865
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,710
The boss. She's in charge of this.

866
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,680
Listen up.

867
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,500
Head to the canteen

868
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,940
before our meal time

869
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,280
for a meeting.

870
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,900
A regular meeting at meal time?

871
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,870
A regular meeting everyday?

872
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,290
How come

873
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,700
she has more tricks than her father?

874
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,880
Just do as I say.

875
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,040
Stop nagging.

876
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,330
Why do you have so much to say?

877
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,440
Come on.

878
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,130
Let's go.

879
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,800
Are we still eating?

880
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,230
Nothing is more persuasive than money.

881
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,100
Enough, let's go to the meeting.

882
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,120
Come on. Let's go for the meeting.

883
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,510
Come on.

884
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:10,980
Get up.

885
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,780
Get moving. It's time for a meeting.

886
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,810
Time for a meeting.

887
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,540
Hurry up.

888
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,170
We're here.

889
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,300
Come on.

890
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,560
Keep up.

891
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,750
What are these?

892
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,350
Shoelaces.

893
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,850
Go inside.

894
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Take your time to look at it.

895
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,590
What's she up to now?

896
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,470
Why did they hang so many shoelaces?

897
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:13,860
Come on.

898
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,230
Everyone's here.

899
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,320
Well...

900
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,880
Everyone.

901
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,330
Ms. Jiang has something

902
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,640
to tell you.

903
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,310
Okay.

904
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,110
I called everyone here today

905
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,600
to

906
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,350
make an official announcement.

907
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,120
From today onwards,

908
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,530
Teng Yue

909
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,480
will officially start work.

910
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,600
Aren't we already working every day?

911
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,990
We've been working every day.

912
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,810
Yes.

913
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,440
We work every day.

914
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,140
Haven't we been working all this time?

915
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,070
The work that we've already started on

916
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,210
is our work as Free Unicorn's OEM.

917
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,920
What we are going to start now

918
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,170
is Teng Yue's

919
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,310
own work.

920
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,950
Master Zhang.

921
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,860
What do you think

922
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,970
is missing with the current Teng Yue shoes?

923
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,950
Ms. Jiang.

924
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,140
I think

925
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,390
we need new designs.

926
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,210
Ten years ago,

927
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,700
Teng Yue

928
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,180
had more than ten different designs.

929
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,820
Now, there are only white shoes.

930
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,840
The previous designs are now outdated.

931
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,030
No one would buy them.

932
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,400
Why can't you hire a designer

933
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,520
to make new designs?

934
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,680
It's a pity, right?

935
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,930
Yes.

936
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,910
Look.

937
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,950
Isn't this much better?

938
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,330
A little trick.

939
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,310
Teng Yue Shoes

940
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,100
must start over.

941
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,690
Although our current design

942
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,890
is still very plain

943
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,630
and we haven't found

944
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,790
the best designer

945
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,360
to help us reinvent it,

946
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,390
we

947
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,460
can't fall back on sales.

948
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,140
So, let's start

949
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,400
with pairing the simplest white shoes

950
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,240
with rainbow shoelaces.

951
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,980
Let's look forward to

952
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,780
Teng Yue's evolution bit by bit.

953
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,660
Okay?

954
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:28,000
Bravo!

955
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,450
Bravo!

956
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,900
For Teng Yue's future,

957
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,520
we're going to have to go on

958
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,910
a tough journey.

959
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,190
I hired a new chef

960
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,230
to improve the food

961
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,450
to cheer everyone up

962
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,330
and boost morale.

963
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:37,500
[Teng Yue]

964
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,720
Take it.

965
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,290
Be careful.

966
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,820
Which one did you choose?

967
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,480
Choose one.

968
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,870
This one.

969
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,620
And this.

970
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,390
Well, then

971
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,230
can you find a match

972
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,180
for mine?

973
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,150
[Teng Yue's white shoes with colorful shoelaces]

974
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,150
[There are many kinds of shoelaces for you to choose from]

975
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,180
Do you think they'll sell well

976
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,340
just by changing the shoelaces?

977
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,550
How could she do

978
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,500
such an unprofessional thing?

979
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,940
What you have

980
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,670
is this month's financial report.

981
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,430
The biggest problem

982
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,420
we're facing right now

983
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,090
is that the cost is too high.

984
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,160
Why are the raw materials' prices

985
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,600
increasing so much more than before?

986
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,940
Well...

987
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,300
We used to be an OEM

988
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,900
of a company under the same group.

989
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,920
So, there were benefits like purchasing

990
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,320
things like glue and whatnot

991
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,340
at the lowest price.

992
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,300
You could even get it for free.

993
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,440
Zhang Wenshan's the boss now.

994
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,470
He won't provide us

995
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,300
with such benefits.

996
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,360
So, naturally,

997
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,600
the cost increased.

998
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,930
The price of everything

999
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,510
in the market is increasing.

1000
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,450
How about

1001
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,370
we also increase the price of our shoes?

1002
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,840
There's no one buying our shoes at the current price.

1003
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,970
If we increase the price,

1004
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,570
who will buy them?

1005
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,600
Are you going to wear it yourself?

1006
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,360
Teng Yue hasn't come up

1007
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,220
with a new design yet.

1008
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,420
We've just

1009
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,100
added colorful shoelaces to an old design.

1010
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,320
Also, we only have the distribution channels

1011
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,480
of online stores, community supermarkets,

1012
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,050
and some group purchases.

1013
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,010
We can't bear

1014
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,360
the pressure caused by the inflation.

1015
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,670
We can only find a way

1016
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,800
to control the cost

1017
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,300
at our current stage as much as possible.

1018
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,400
Let's change the materials then.
