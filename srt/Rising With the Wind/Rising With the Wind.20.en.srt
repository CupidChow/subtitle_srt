00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,560
I tried everything I could when I talked to the Board of Directors.

00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,440
They agreed

8
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,880
to give you one last chance

9
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,920
to restore your order.

10
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,570
But

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,090
this matter

12
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,000
has caused a decline in trust

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
toward Free Unicorn and Teng Yue.

14
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,350
I've already taken care of everything.

15
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,730
And this matter

16
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,690
didn't cause Free Unicorn

17
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,170
any negative influence.

18
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,770
Jiang Hu, you should know

19
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,009
that the consumers don't think so.

20
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,610
You have to take responsibility.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Fine.

22
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,560
What do you want me to do?

23
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,050
For the next orders,

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,960
deduct two more yuan for each pair of shoes.

25
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,770
You have already

26
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,960
deducted a penalty fee

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,440

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,780
If Teng Yue continues to rest,

31
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,320
people will be disheartened.

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,050
One yuan.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,690
No more.

34
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,720
I dare say that even factories in Southeast Asia

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,320
can't offer this price.

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,960

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,440
Recently, Xiang Zhaoyang and Shangchun Art Project

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,940
jointly launched videos

62
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,480
of three Chinese-style bottle art painting.

63
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,860
Their flagship shops are all sold out.

64
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,750
The Chinese people

65
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,040
are increasingly more interested

66
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,050
in Chinese-style products.

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,280
What are you trying to say?

68
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,940
What Teng Yue wants to do

69
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,080
is to create Chinese-style products

70
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,830
to continue

71
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,480
the current national trend of our national culture.

72
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,680
And Xiang Zhaoyang

73
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,010
is the most suitable candidate.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,370
I must get her

75
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,480
to be Teng Yue's designer.

76
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,800

with our products

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,050
can we get rid of all the constraints

79
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,580

have received more than a million likes

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
across several major online platforms.

85
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:57,590
In particular,

86
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,030
the response on overseas platforms

87
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,270

the order volume for this quarter

91
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,270

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,720
This is the greatest conversion efficiency

93
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,350
among our collaborations in this quarter.

94
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,150
Okay.

95
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,260
Zhaoyang.

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,830
Shangchun Art Project has also invested a lot

97
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,220
in this collaboration.

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,030
They plan to sign

99
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,230
a strategic cooperation agreement with you.

100
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,680
Their spokesperson

101
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,030
also used

102
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,230
the bottle art you drew for them

103
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,470
in their promotional video.

104
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,710
Zhaoyang.

105
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,970
You're quite good

106
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,230
at design indeed.

107
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,620
A few days ago, Shangchun Art Project's

108
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,670
stock market was sluggish.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,350
Just after working with an influencer once,

110
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,230
it had a boom?

111
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,710
According to this trend,

112
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,590
I estimate

113
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,790
that the limit up price will be increased soon.

114
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,840
I think an increase in the limit up price

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,400
is pretty good.

116
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,710
For other healthcare companies,

117
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,470
it's a good thing.

118
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,150
But not necessarily for Shangchun Art Project.

119
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,690
In the past two years,

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,270
the couple who founded the company haven't been getting along.

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,110
The company has been poorly managed internally.

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,670
And the launch of their new products

123
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,810
has been continually postponed.

124
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,260
There's no need to mention profit.

125
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,710
Do you mean

126
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,270
to investigate

127
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,350
the other shareholders' backgrounds

128
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,160
apart from the founders

129
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,140
Hua Wenhai and Cao Jing?

130
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,180
Okay.

131
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,200
Hello.

132
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
Are you free tonight?

133
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,120
For a date?

134
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,620
Let me make it clear.

135
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,470
This meal is not a date.

136
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,270
Then what is it?

137
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,670
A meeting.

138
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,350
What meeting?

139
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,680
Shangchun Art Project's

140
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,990
stocks have been surging these days.

141
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,350
Is it temporary

142
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,280
or will it last for a while?

143
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,460
You pay so much attention to Shangchun Art Project

144
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,870
because of Xiang Zhaoyang, right?

145
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,360
Does this business cooperation of hers

146
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
have anything to do with Baoxing?

147
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,870
Why do you ask?

148
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,150
Behind any abnormal

149
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,310
stock price fluctuation,

150
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,470
there must be some unusual

151
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,310
business moves.

152
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,670
How much

153
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,470
will this affect her?

154
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,250
What do you think?

155
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,190
If it's

156
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,230
her market influence

157
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,850
that caused a natural fluctuation in stock prices,

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,370
then there'll be a further premium

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,550
on her market value in the future.

160
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,350
I'm afraid it'll be too high for me to afford her.

161
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,060
If it's not a natural fluctuation,

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
with her personality,

163
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,130
I don't think she'll agree

164
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,040
with your company's game.

165
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,380
I'm getting a little jealous of Xiang Zhaoyang.

166
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,680
You asked me out today

167
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,950
just for her.

168
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,230
You even did such a thorough analysis of me.

169
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,760
Shangchun Art Project's

170
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,830
recent stock fluctuation

171
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,850
is only temporary.

172
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,750
It won't last long.

173
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,220
I see.

174
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,310
Thank you.

175
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,200
Are you done with business?

176
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,870
Let's talk about something personal.

177
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,730
Have you made up your mind?

178
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,010
Mr. Xu, sorry.

179
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,590
Mr. Xu?

180
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,940
Sorry?

181
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,720
If I did something

182
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,870
that made you misunderstand,

183
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,730
it's all my fault.

184
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,640
What are you talking about?

185
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,700
I said I wanted to pursue you.

186
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,750
So there's no need

187
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,190
to put up a front between you and me.

188
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,020
Take some time to consider me.

189
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,420
Xu Si.

190
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,830
If I

191
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,870
said or did

192
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,980
something to you,

193
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,560
I'll apologize first.

00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,150
he is still

385
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,990
the actual controller of the company.

386
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,660
But the most interesting thing is

387
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,190
that in both

388
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,380
Fangpei Shares

389
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,600
and Heshan Technology,

390
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,940
this guy surnamed Zhang is holding shares

391
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,970
on behalf of Mr. Du.

392
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,560
Actually, Mr. Du has personally

393
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,400
invested in a lot of companies.

394
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,570
It's normal that he has a lot of shares

395
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,540
in other listed companies.

396
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,230
Shangchun Art Project's stock price

397
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,950
has reached

398
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,560
its highest point in the past two years.

399
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,690
If nothing goes wrong,

400
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,080
the rise will stop today.

401
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,870
And then?

402
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,570
Ms. Song, bad news.

403
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,470
Shangchun Art Project's stock price

404
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,350
has dropped rapidly.

405
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,440
My 50,000 yuan

406
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,510
is gone just like that?

407
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,190
Where can we return it?

408
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,550
How can it be gone?

409
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,390
I was still waiting for it to make me a fortune.

410
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,100
In just five minutes,

411
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,730
it fell right to the bottom.

412
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,640
You only invested 50,000 yuan.

413
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,230
I invested 300,000 yuan.

414
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,540
In a blink of an eye,

415
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,760
it's gone.

416
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,870
What should I do?

417
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,870
Shangchun Art Project...

418
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,900
That Zhou Suqing.

419
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,980
They got me into trouble again.

420
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,820
They are all bad guys.

421
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,010
I think we should find them.

422
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,130
My life is still better than yours.

423
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,610
Even God

424
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,720
helped a beautiful woman like me.

425
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,270
It's Zhou Suqing again.

426
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,780
They got me into trouble.

427
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,360
What are you talking about?

428
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,940
What did you say?

429
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,410
Can you say something nice?

430
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,250
You deserve it this time.

431
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,410
Bless me.

432
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,660
You don't look like

433
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,100
you're here

434
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,470
specially to play golf with me.

435
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm here to consult you, Mr. Du.

436
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,710
About...

437
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,740
Shangchun Art Project?

438
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,950
First, you used internal equity adjustment

439
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,210
and reduced the influence the costly divorce case would have had

440
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,340
on the stock price.

441
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,480
Then you used

442
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,390
the influencer concept stocks to increase the stock price.

443
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,460
So, what's next?

444
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,140
What's your plan with Hua Wenhai

445
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,170
for Shangchun Art Project?

446
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,330
My plan...

447
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,570
is similar to what you're thinking.

448
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,850
Hua Wenhai and his wife have been dragging on

449
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,360
their divorce for nearly two years.

450
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,230
It had a great impact on the development

451
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,230
of Sangchun Art Project.

452
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,990
It's better to rip off the band-aid.

453
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,040
Letting them get what

454
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,030
each of them want

455
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,640
and ending the internal strife as soon as possible

456
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,710
is the most

457
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,770
efficient method for the company

458
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,870
to resume regular operations.

459
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,740
But

460
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,220
the market reputation of TT Media

461
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,310
will not be so favorable.

462
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,290
The stock price fluctuation

463
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,970
is too great.

464
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,350
This little loss

465
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,790
is not worth mentioning

466
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,060
in the face of profit.

467
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,910
This is a consensus of the smart people

468
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,870
involved in this situation.

469
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,290
Xu Si.

470
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,850
Seize the opportunity

471
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,800
that is about to pass.

472
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,950
Letting the most important person

473
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,340
get the maximum benefit

474
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,430
is the best-case scenario.

475
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,390
Is there no turning back

476
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
with the current situation?

477
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,700
Focus on the direction.

478
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,150
When you hit the ball,

479
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,580
it'll never come back.

480
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,510
Mr. Du.

481
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,430
The direction I'm aim for

482
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,740
is to allow everyone in the situation

483
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,560
to win together.

484
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,700
This is my principle

485
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,180
as an investor.

486
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,160
Since

487
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,660
Baoxing invested in these three companies,

488
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,040
only when everyone is doing well

489
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,990
can Baoxing be better.

490
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,360
When we worked with Shangchun Art Project,

491
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,350
you never told me

492
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,590
that it'd be so risky.

493
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,230
This is not the direction I want.

494
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,820
What happened now

495
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,870
is completely beyond

496
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,630
my knowledge.

497
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,390
Zhaoyang.

498
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,470
You're too sensitive.

499
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,500
The client's stock price

500
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,830
has nothing to do with you.

501
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,330
Don't worry about it.

502
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,990
Still, I can't be a tool to be used

503
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,230
in the games of the stock market.

504
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,390
Although I don't know how to invest in stocks,

505
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,250
I think this steep rise and fall

506
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,420
has

507
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,390
already affected many people.

508
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,070
Why do you care so much

509
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,980
about others?

510
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,700
Right now, things are at the height

511
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,430
of the storm.

512
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,180
There is a lot good and bad news.

513
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,350
When things blow over,

514
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,790
everything will be peaceful again.

515
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,590
Just like the last ordeal,

516
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,930
now, no one mentions

517
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,830
your family background anymore,

518
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,500
no?

519
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,480
Although I admit

520
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,940
that I'm in this line of work for money,

521
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,170
I won't make money

522
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,270
through illicit means.

523
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,230
Zhaoyang.

524
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,380
Are you blaming us and Baoxing

525
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,680
for making you go against your principles?

526
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,700
Maybe this is

527
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,660
what this industry is about.

528
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,620
Harvesting traffic dividends.

529
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,240
I think

530
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,890
I'm not suitable for it.

531
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,220
What do you mean?

532
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,550
You want to terminate the contract?

533
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,550
You should know

534
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,870
that you are heading to the peak of your career.

535
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,110
Your business resources

536
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,960
are the best brands.

537
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,950
Your quotation is also of top-tier standard.

538
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,750
Song Zhi.

539
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,200
You

540
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,980
are my first agent.

541
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,770
Maybe

542
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,770
you'd be my only one too.

543
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm grateful

544
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,910
for all your help.

545
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,170
You're giving up a successful path

546
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,870
that can become even more successful

547
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,770
to take a tough path

548
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,750
where the future is uncertain.

549
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,430
I feel bad for you.

550
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,180
You don't have to feel bad for me.

551
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,070
I have to

552
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,210
walk my own path.

553
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,400
It seems that Jiang Hu's evaluation of you

554
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,390
and the direction

555
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,690
you set for yourself

556
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,070
is quite consistent.

557
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,910
She talked about me with you?

558
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,060
Ms. Song.

559
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,620
Big Bird's interview is about to begin.

560
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,480
We're waiting for you.

561
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:22,820
Zhaoyang.

562
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,440
Please reconsider carefully.

563
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,560
We'll talk later.

564
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,220
It's in this factory

565
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,540
that you two started

566
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,660
Shangchun Art Project's business.

567
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,990
In 2006,

568
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,630
when no one dared to venture into group buying,

569
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,180
the flagship shop of your ace product,

570
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,680
Huajian Baini,

571
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,170
ventured into group buying as soon as it was listed,

572
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,250
and the sales

573
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,520
was ten times that of Korean products.

574
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,230
The sales in a quarter

575
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,230
exceeded 1 million.

576
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,710
In less than five years,

577
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,950
your IPO was successful.

578
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,120
In the history of A-shares,

579
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,390
you became one of the capital operation cases

580
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,860
with the fastest IPO process.

581
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,740
It was also one of the first

582
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,040
e-commerce brands to be listed.

583
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,130
I think both of you can't forget those years

584
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,710
you've spent creating your business together.

585
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,200
For the past decade,

586
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,390
I have only five words.

587
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,760
Unbearable to look back at.

588
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
So, Mr. Xu,

589
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,360
just get to the point.

590
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,710
From 2006 to now,

591
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,450
Shangchun Art Project's reputation

592
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,990
as the top national cosmetics brand

593
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,190
wasn't easy to come.

594
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,180
I suppose you two wouldn't want to see

595
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,990
the brand

596
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,590
you created by dedicating your entire youth to

597
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,570
be burned to the ground.

598
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,510
Xu Si.

599
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,650
You made it sound too serious.

600
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,680
Too serious.

601
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,980
You two have worked together

602
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,390
for over ten years.

603
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,760
If it's just for the pleasure

604
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,120
of earning a lot of money today,

605
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,050
I can help you

606
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,110
expedite this.

607
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,260
Let's let go

608
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,870
of the past together

609
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,460
and give Shangchun Art Project

610
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,130
a grand funeral.

611
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,330
Sorry.

612
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,350
I failed to protect the painting for you.

613
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,490
This afternoon,

614
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,940
a dozen stockholders gathered here.

615
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,230
Even the security couldn't stop them.

616
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,320
There was almost a conflict.

617
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,740
But don't worry.

618
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,040
The Marketing Department

619
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,480
has made an emergency plan

620
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,750
for this sudden situation.

621
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,300
For the time being,

622
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,620
try to stay at home as much as possible.

623
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,450
Let's wait until things settle down.

624
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,820
I caused you trouble.

625
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,670
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,770
Why are you sorry?

627
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,800
It's not your fault.

628
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,910
All the chaos and losses

629
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,130
were caused by me.

630
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,600
How could it not be my fault?

631
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,670
You must remember

632
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,630
that you mustn't always take on

633
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,720
the responsibilities of others.

634
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,310
In this situation,

635
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,850
you need to learn

636
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,240
to reduce your own burden.

637
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,290
Excuse me.

638
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:31,950
Hello?

639
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,610
Okay.

640
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,660
I'll go back now.

641
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,980
What's wrong?

642
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,970
Something urgent came up at home.

643
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,780
I have to go.

644
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,480
Is it serious?

645
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,410
Do you need my help?

646
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,010
It's okay.

647
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,510
Let me call a taxi for you.

648
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,110
No, I can do it myself.

649
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,300
Okay.

650
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,160
When you get home,

651
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,270
remember to give me a text.

652
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:54,970
I'm leaving.

653
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,150
Go ahead.

654
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:56,730
Okay.

655
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,070
At home?

656
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,080
Hasn’t Gao Yi’s parents…

657
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,510
[I’ll be home soon. Get some rest.]

658
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,140
How unlucky.

659
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,710
I'm sorry.

660
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,070
My car broke down again.

661
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,820
What bad luck.

662
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,300
Well...

663
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,230
I'm really sorry.

664
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,900
It's okay.

665
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,770
How about I pay you first?

666
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,980
Well, out of 18 yuan,

667
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,210
I'll charge you 10 yuan.

668
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,280
Thank you.

669
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,750
Okay.

670
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,190
Got it.

671
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,030
Thank you.

672
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,710
Thank you.

673
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,470
Thank you for understanding.

674
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,940
No problem.

675
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,970
Who's it at this late hour?

676
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,570
Hello, Zhaoyang.

677
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,470
Hello, Yang Jian.

678
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,650
I think I'm being tailed.

679
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,630
What?

680
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,350
Where are you? I'm on my way now.

681
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,060
Where's my car?

682
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,350
Go away!

683
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:22,830
Zhaoyang.

684
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,300
Zhaoyang, it's me.

685
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,630
It's me.

686
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,560
Yang Jian.

687
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,840
Stop chasing.

688
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,340
It's my fault.

689
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,440
I was careless.

690
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,210
I should have

691
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:22,900
noticed this beforehand.

692
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,670
It's not your fault.

693
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,590
Finish your shower. Don't catch a cold.

694
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:27,990
Let's go.

695
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,790
Come on.

696
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,380
Zhaoyang.

697
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,130
Don't bother.

698
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,930
I'm going back.

699
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,040
The water is ready.

700
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,780
Hurry and take a shower.

701
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,470
What are you waiting for?

702
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,050
Take a shower.

703
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,510
Zhaoyang.

704
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,910
Zhaoyang.

705
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,780
Is there a towel I can use?

706
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,830
Hold on.

707
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,810
Here. You can use this.

708
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,780
How about I come in and give it to you?

709
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,690
No, no, no.

710
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,420
I-I can

711
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,480
g-get it myself.

712
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,900
Did you get it?

713
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,000
Well, push it forward

714
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,690
a little bit more.

715
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,410
Okay.

716
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,480
Watch your hand.

717
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,590
Done.

718
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,990
I-I can do it myself.

719
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,860
I can do it myself.

720
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,410
L-Let me do it.

721
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,790
This...

722
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,180
Do I need to apply this?

723
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,050
Wait, this is...

724
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,580
Don't move.

725
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,730
Can't you stop fighting?

726
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,040
Is it so hard to be good in school?

727
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,030
Unlike you,

728
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,810
I'm not good at studying at all.

729
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,900
You have to think highly of yourself

730
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,190
if you don't want others to look down on you.

731
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,680
Turn your face around.

732
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,310
The other side.

733
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,410
You can wear this, right?

734
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,640
Okay.

735
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,150
Why don't you try it on?

736
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,050
A-Anything is fine.
