TT Media

during their partnership

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,990
with you.

10
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,190
Also,

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,560
according to the contract agreement,

12
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,280
the business opportunities they supplied

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,750
also had a high compensation total.

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,300
To terminate the contract,

15
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,070
you'll have to compensate at least one million yuan.

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,840
Okay, I got it.

18
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,840
let me think about it.

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,170
I'll discuss it with you later.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,710
Okay.

21
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,710
Zhaoyang,

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,829

and Aneda—

25
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,860
I don't need it.

26
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,070
You want to be a designer.

27
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,220
Now is not the time

28
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,470
to be willful.

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,850
If I can't be a designer now,

30
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,740
I can wait for a few more years if I must.

31
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,710
Won't you think it's a pity

32
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,890
to waste so many years?

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,710
Some people's time

34
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,960
are to be wasted.

35
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,190
Did you give

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,640

37
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,800
or did Jiang Hu?

38
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,710
Jiang Hu.

39
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,570
I said I'll pay,

40
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,190
but she refused to take it.

41
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,710
Okay.

42
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,150
Eat something.

43
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,620
You're busy.

44
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,070
From now on,

45
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,560
you don't have to keep coming here anymore.

46
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,980
Okay.

47
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,710
I'll leave then.

Thank you.

96
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,670
I took the initiative

97
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,710
to order a cup of coffee for you.

98
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,350
You still remember

99
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,740
that I like Mandheling coffee.

100
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,470
After all, we've been

101
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,270
business partners for years.

102
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,850
I realize

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,030
that I have been

104
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,940
clearly categorized

105
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,750
in your mind.

106
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,670
I can finally understand

107
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,240
Mei Shaowang's view of you.

108
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,710
What is it?

109
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,890
You act decisively.

110
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,710
You're calm to the point of heartlessness.

111
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,670
It doesn't sound

112
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,790
like a compliment.

113
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,110
Back in school,

114
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,590
I thought that people like you

115
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,490
were cool.

116
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,200
After dating, I realized

117
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,150
that dating someone

118
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,840
like you

119
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,960
is no different from not dating at all.

120
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,240
You separate each matter

121
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,570
more clearly than anyone else.

122
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,470
Are you complaining about me?

123
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't dare to now.

124
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,030
Tell me.

125
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,270
What can I do for you, Boss?

126
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,670
Teng Yue plans to invite Xiang Zhaoyang

127
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,570
to be their designer.

128
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,800
Have they discussed

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,910
this matter with you?

130
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,350
Why do you care about such a small matter?

131
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,190
Both companies are within the range

132
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,540
of my post-investment service, after all.

133
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,090
You're too modest.

134
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,590
So your suggestion is...

135
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,710
Be lenient?

136
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,830
Do you want to be my boss

137
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,000
and handle this business matter

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,380
or do you want to chat with me

139
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,679
with your private identity?

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,110
It's work hours right now.

141
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,500
It's a business matter.

142
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,950
Okay, let me hear your suggestion.

143
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,070
You're the one who discovered Xiang Zhaoyang

144
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,630
and put her in the position.

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,110
Why is the current arrangement

146
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,750
completely different from before?

147
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,410
Xiang Zhaoyang

148
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,310
indeed has

149
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,630
the conditions

150
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,930
to develop into more commercial fields

151
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,890
as an influencer.

152
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,990
Moreover,

153
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,510
she really doesn't want to be an influencer.

154
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,190
Why don't you put her

155
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,660
where she's more valuable?

156
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,370
So you want me to terminate the contract with her

157
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,400
and let her go to Teng Yue?

158
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,770
I just want to remind you

159
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,810
that apart from traditional advertising

160
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,590
and livestream commissions,

161
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,110
you can also

162
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,170
build a deeper and more long-term

163
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,230
collaboration with the brands.

164
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,470
You mean

165
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,360
we are in charge of

166
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,710
creating influencers on the front-end.

167
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,510
Then we'll deliver them to a single brand

168
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,070
for long-term cooperation

169
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,870
and build the brand with them?

170
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,590
New methods need new cases.

171
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,630
No,

172
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,870
are you asking me to send her there for free

173
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,720
just to have a new case?

174
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,960
After the Shangchun Art Project

175
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,720
is completed,

176
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,230
Xiang Zhaoyang's popularity

177
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,980
should reach a higher level.

178
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,050
You'll have the upper hand

179
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,740
in negotiating with Teng Yue by then.

180
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,920
Plus, giving a quote,

181
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,890
bargaining,

182
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,150
and whether it's a good deal or not

183
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,590
will only be known after negotiating,

184
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,590
right?

185
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,230
It seems that my direction

186
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,950
has been wrong since the start.

187
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,320
To have Mr. Xu,

188
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,480
who either has physical or mental issues,

189
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,920
to end his four-year bachelor period

190
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,660
is not a popular influencer

191
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,710
but an heiress from a bankrupted family.

192
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,770
If you put half of your gossip skills

193
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,210
into your work,

194
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,590
TT Media would already be listed in the stock market.

195
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,470
You didn't deny it?

196
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,360
It must be true then.

197
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,190
I never thought this.

198
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,430
If you didn't,

199
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,830
then you can think more about it.

200
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,670
We need to push Zhang Wenshan

201
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,390
for their payment again.

202
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,110
It was delayed for two days last time.

203
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,380
I guess the final payment

204
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,810
will be delayed for even longer.

205
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,800
I've already pushed him.

206
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,730
Let me do it again.

207
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,980
Has the money from Fahe arrived?

208
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,170
They said they'll pay in a few days,

209
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,310
but they didn't give a specific date.

210
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,600
Hello?

211
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,210
Okay, go ahead.

212
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,640
Are you kidding me?

213
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,670
Who said that?

214
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,510
Are you sure?

215
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,780
We have...

216
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,500
We have a problem.

217
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,930
Yang Jian.

218
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,440
Here.

219
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,840
Bad news.

220
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,830
Something happened with our shoes.

221
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,820
Look.

222
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,430
What's wrong?

223
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,000
How could it be unqualified?

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,590
They said our shoes aren't qualified.

225
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,260
No.

[Teng Yue Shoes Failed Inspections]

227
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
I really wonder if my salary or an accident

228
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,510
will come first.

229
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,510
Hello.

230
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:17,960
Today,

231
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,870
Market Supervision Administration

232
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,360
inspected Teng Yue.

233
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,500
What's wrong?

234
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,070
Something didn't meet requirements.

235
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,730
One hormone-containing substance exceeded limits.

236
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,050
Keep an eye on this.

237
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,950
Okay, I got it.

238
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,110
Have you heard about Teng Yue's news?

239
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,080
I just heard.

240
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,850
You're still so calm after knowing it.

241
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,440
There's a problem with the quality

242
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,780
right after the sales improved a little.

243
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,630
Now, they're beaten back

244
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,680
to the starting line.

245
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,350
No,

246
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,220
they're practically

247
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,290
beaten to death now.

248
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,430
As an investor,

249
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,590
you should have confidence and patience

250
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,190
for your prejudgment.

251
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,290
I have a weak heart.

252
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,070
I can't stand drama like this.

253
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm dealing with Teng Yue's matter.

254
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,620
How's the progress

255
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,690
with Aneda?

256
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,110
Can Teng Yue

257
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,110
still catch their eye?

258
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,190
I hope it won't end

259
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,530
with Baoxing’s efforts being in vain.

260
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,970
Aneda's pace isn't that fast.

261
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,780
The funds

262
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,400
and communication problems with internal shareholders

263
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,110
will keep them busy

264
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,210
for quite some time.

265
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,240
I'll take care of it.

266
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,340
Look at this.

267
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,320
The Market Supervision Administration

268
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,110
hasn't officially announced anything yet,

269
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,760
but there are already

270
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,900
many negative comments online.

271
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,550
This.

272
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,120
Jiang Hu.

273
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,570
Has the report come out?

274
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,380
Yes.

275
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,990
Which parts have problems?

276
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,690
Phthalates exceed the standard limit.

277
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,480
It's the eyelets.

278
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,970
I've found it out.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The Market Supervision Administration

280
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,700
received a report.

281
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,880
The boss has been punished

282
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,430
by the local Market Supervision Administration.

283
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,430
So this time,

284
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,470
they didn't just investigate Teng Yue.

285
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,110
Next Monday,

286
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,360
they'll publish a news announcement

287
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,950
together.

288
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,310
Next Monday?

289
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,130
Since they'll publish the news

290
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,080
next Monday,

291
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,780
then how come

292
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,760
there's news of Teng Yue being unqualified

293
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,990
right now?

294
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,810
The eyelets

295
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,860
were from a supplier introduced by Liu Jun, right?

296
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,610
Liu Jun did it.

297
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,830
It turns out that he's caused troubled already.

298
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,640
The news online

299
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,630
must have been released by him.

300
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,240
We shouldn't have

301
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,710
let him off so easily.

302
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,120
Liu Jun isn't important anymore.

303
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,590
What should we do?

304
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:23,550
[Teng Yue]

305
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,500
I've already stopped

306
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,680
the production line.

307
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,280
Fortunately,

308
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,960
we produced less than 6,000 pairs.

309
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,390
It's my problem.

310
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,230
Jiang Hu.

311
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,340
I'm too inexperienced.

312
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,190
I didn't assess the suppliers well.

313
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,310
Don't blame yourself.

314
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,590
Everyone can be careless at times.

315
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,510
We really

316
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,360
have problem after problem.

317
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,350
What did Teng Yue

318
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,610
get jinxed by?

319
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,360
Did I say something wrong?

320
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,870
Did I say something wrong?

321
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,150
The offline distributors

322
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,910
are asking to return their products.

323
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,330
The people who bought

324
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,010
from Yang Jian's online store

325
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,670
are all asking for refunds too.

326
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,190
The cost of these 6,000 pairs of shoes

327
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,200
will all go to waste.

328
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,430
Can we afford it?

329
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,100
What about the cost?

330
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,460
We just re-hired so many workers.

331
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
Now they're all stuck in the factory.

332
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,760
What should we do next?

333
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,750
Do we produce shoes

334
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,590
or curses?

335
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,480
Let's figure out a way together.

336
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,630
I don't believe

337
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,920
we can't get through this.

338
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,310
Yes, it's fine.

339
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,990
Destroy this batch of goods first.

340
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,230
Write an explanation to the bureau.

341
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,060
Gosh.

342
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,450
That Liu Jun.

343
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,070
Hello.

344
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,870
You were

345
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,310
inspected by the Market Supervision Administration.

346
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,830
Do you know how much

347
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,960
this will affect Free Unicorn?

348
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,970
Teng Yue's shoes getting inspected.

349
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,680
It has nothing to do with Free Unicorn.

350
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,270
You're wrong.

351
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,310
What do you mean

352
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,510
by "it has nothing to do with Free Unicorn"?

353
00:16:59,310 --> 00:16:59,880
My shoes

354
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,670
were made by your factory,

355
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,230
right?

356
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,880
You think my shoes will be fine

357
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,270
if Teng Yue's shoes have problems?

358
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,099
We both know that

359
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,470
Teng Yue and Free Unicorn

360
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,950
don't use the same suppliers.

361
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,510
Besides,

362
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,910
it can be proven with evidence.

363
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,960
Anyway, you got me into trouble.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,079
What are you trying to say?

365
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,230
The legal department suggested

366
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,160
to ask you for compensation,

367
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,510
but with our relationship,

368
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,990
it's too hurtful to request compensation.

369
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,470
Instead, I'll deduct

370
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,370
a fine from the final payment.

371
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,160
It's just a show

372
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,670
for the Board of Directors.

373
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,580
Zhang Wenshan,

374
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,070
you're taking advantage of me.

375
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,530
I can only do this much to help you.

376
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,590
Pause the OEM orders

377
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,390
for now.

378
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,510
Let's talk after you solve

379
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,150
this crisis.

380
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,630
Jiang Hu is still too inexperienced.

381
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,190
She can't even do

382
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,230
such a simple task

383
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,020
as factory HR management.

384
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,910
It's not the time

385
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,230
to abandon any soldiers yet.

386
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,730
The general must be decisive

387
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,510
about soldiers who can't cross

388
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,670
to the other side.

389
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,470
Don't worry.

390
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,950
I've set up the bridge

391
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,810
for Teng Yue to cross over.

392
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,400
Now, we just need someone

393
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,230
who can put on a show on the bridge.

394
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,190
You mean

395
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,070
Jiang Hu can put on a good show?

396
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,130
Experience needs to be accumulated.

397
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,720
Plus, Teng Yue's current stage

398
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,070
of development is the perfect time

399
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,270
to take advantage

400
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,190
of her identity as the daughter of Jiang Qisheng,

401
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,390
the former King of Apparel.

402
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,910
This will be a good story

403
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,000
for the market.

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,300
As long as it doesn't affect

405
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,450
the final result.

406
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,430
It won't.

407
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,360
Try to give it to me next week.

408
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,540
That's all.

409
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,210
I'll leave you to it.

410
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,790
What's wrong?

411
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,630
Inform Teng Yue

412
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,450
that the next quarter's KPI,

413
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,790
especially the profit margin,

414
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,220
won't be reviewed for now.

415
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,430
Am I

416
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,460
too tired from work recently?

417
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,550
I'm hallucinating.

418
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,670
Must be hallucinating.

419
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,690
If Teng Yue wants to make a comeback,

420
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,230
they'll definitely increase

421
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,340
marketing expenses.

422
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,620
Also, Free Unicorn

423
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,650
has stopped

424
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
their OEM order.

425
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,980
It won't be easy for them.

426
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,670
You care too much about Teng Yue.

427
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,750
If Teng Yue can't achieve a goal,

428
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,420
Jiang Hu won't be able to do it,

429
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,950
even if I push her to her limit.

430
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,550
I won’t give the founders

431
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,160
an impossible KPI.

432
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,510
It's better to wait until the end of the year

433
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,030
and calculate it as a whole.

434
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,950
Right?

435
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,350
You don't have to explain to me, actually.

436
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,170
You don't have to.

437
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm not explaining to you.

438
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,710
I'm trying to convince myself.

439
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,710
Convince yourself?

440
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,000
This is the last batch of shoes

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,390
to be destroyed.

442
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,310
It's 500 pairs in total.

443
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,750
There's no way

444
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,350
we can meet

445
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,270
the next quarter's KPI.

446
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,080
Think about it.

447
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,510
How can you explain to Mr. Xu?

448
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,510
Master Zhang,

449
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,790
Baoxing just notified me

450
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,450
that they canceled

451
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,810
this quarter's KPI review for Teng Yue.

452
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,270
They'll only look at the annual total.

453
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,280
Looks like Mr. Xu

454
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,160
gave us some help.

455
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,950
I don't even know

456
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,990
how to celebrate now.

457
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,790
About the KPI review,

458
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,510
thanks.

459
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,900
A verbal thanks doesn't count.

460
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,910
What should we do then, Boss?

461
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,110
Accompany me to a dinner tonight.

462
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,540
I can't.

463
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,430
I have a meeting at the factory tonight.

464
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,870
Your boss gave you an order.

465
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,870
There's no room for discussion.

466
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,320
Fine.

467
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,750
I'll be there in half an hour.

468
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,360
You're pretty good

469
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,010
at acting like the boss.

470
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,390
Don't forget to dress up.

471
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,180
Master Zhang,

472
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,240
reschedule tonight's meeting to tomorrow morning.

473
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,670
Help me inform the others.

474
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:16,930
Okay.

475
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,430
Are these your most formal clothes?

476
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,710
You should be satisfied.

477
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,190
This is

478
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,430
my only dress.

479
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,060
You know that

480
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,150
in order to pay for Teng Yue,

481
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,990
I sold all

482
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,710
of my decent clothes.

483
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,630
Your jacket

484
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,350
is pretty handsome.

485
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,310
I have good taste.

486
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,940
It depends on the person wearing it too.

487
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,120
Let's go.

488
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,830
What dinner is it tonight?

489
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,640
The attendees include

490
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,590
a reporter from the city's business newspaper,

491
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
some finance

492
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,150
and production field bloggers,

493
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,230
and

494
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,870
a host of a venture capital podcast.

495
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,350
Then,

496
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,950
am I

497
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,130
the only founder

498
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,130
attending with you?

499
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,510
You're the only one.

500
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,420
You have half an hour

501
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,410
to prepare mentally.

502
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,870
Think about what you should chat about

503
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,880
when you meet them later.

504
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,390
Thank you.

505
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,820
Ms. Yue.

506
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,920
Jiang Hu,

507
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,490
tonight's meeting was changed to tomorrow.

508
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,100
Do you have

509
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,100
some problem?

510
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,160
Where are you?

511
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,040
I've been looking for you.

512
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,870
No.

513
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,750
Xu Si and I

514
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,510
are going to a reporter's dinner

515
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,780
to chat with them

516
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,190
about Teng Yue's recent matters.

517
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,080
That's great of Xu Si.

518
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,630
Don't forget when you're interacting with him...

519
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,400
You know what I mean.

520
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,780
I understand.

521
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,290
Okay, go ahead.

522
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,140
What do you understand?

523
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,470
How to get along with the boss.

524
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,630
Jiang Hu,

525
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,780
when you're wooing a girl,

526
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,460
you must have

527
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,760
the most sincere attitude.

528
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,950
What do you think of my attitude?

529
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,220
Playing dumb

530
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,220
doesn't solve problems.

531
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,550
What?

532
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,880
Teng Yue already has

533
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,370
its own shoe last laboratory.

534
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,290
Just like in the 90s,

535
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,260
everything from design to the R&D and production

536
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,250
are all completed

537
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,200
in our own factory.

538
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,260
Many new brands

539
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,470
in the apparel and fashion industry

540
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,700
choose OEMs

541
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,980
and outsource

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,140
the parts that they don't understand

543
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,900
or aren't good at.

544
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,030
Then, why

545
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,030
did you choose from the start

546
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,440
to do the opposite?

547
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,140
Many people would think

548
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,430
that you must completely understand

549
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,900
an industry

550
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,370
before you work in it

551
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,840
and start to take action,

552
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,260
but that's practically impossible.

553
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,830
No one

554
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,170
can completely grasp

555
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,710
an industry in a short time.

556
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,900
If you

557
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
put all your time

558
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,920
on learning and preparation,

559
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,080
then the real action

560
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,230
will never happen.

561
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,890
So, I chose to work first

562
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,370
and learn and improve

563
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
in the process of working.

564
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,560
Ms. Jiang,

565
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,500
aren’t you afraid that the cost of mistakes

566
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,850
in this process would be too high?

567
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,130
When people do something

568
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,190
they've never

569
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,670
done before,

570
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,540
they always fear mistakes

571
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,930
and will repeatedly weigh the pros and cons,

572
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,590
but they often don't produce results.

573
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,820
Before I'm sure

574
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,920
which direction

575
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,770
I should run in,

576
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,410
I choose to start running first.

577
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,490
It's better than staying in one place.

578
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,860
What if you fall?

579
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,750
In the process of running,

580
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,600
I can't help falling

581
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,470
due to lack of experience or skills,

582
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,420
but I can only know

583
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,080
where the pits are by falling.

584
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,700
Just like this time,

585
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,550
we used

586
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,680
the wrong supplier.

587
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,540
I'm very apologetic

588
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,350
to the consumers for this.

589
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,840
I won't make

590
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,310
such a mistake again.

591
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,070
Now,

592
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,230
we've introduced a tracking system

593
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,920
so that consumers

594
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,190
can see clearly

595
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,590
who we are working with

596
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,950
and whether they are safe or not.

597
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,790
Yes. Generally speaking,

598
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,730
the problems faced by companies

599
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,530
in the early stages

600
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,280
are made up for

601
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,120
in the process of development.

602
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,710
Teng Yue

603
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,280
was founded in the 1920s.

604
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,390
It was originally

605
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,940
a branch factory of a rubber company.

606
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,280
Before making rubber-soled shoes,

607
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,640
they didn't have much experience in making shoes either.

608
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,960
It developed step by step

609
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,830
to gradually become a national brand.

[Xixingji E-commerce]

611
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,190
Hello, everyone.

612
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,230
I am Wu

613
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,370
from Xixingji E-commerce.

614
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,680
Teng Yue

615
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,770
indeed made a mistake this time.

616
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,400
We promise

617
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,630
we won't hide it,

make excuses,

619
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,270
or delay things.

620
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,120
From now on,

621
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,170
there won't be

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,920
another pair of Teng Yue shoes with problems

623

Within three months,

we will launch

Teng Yue's Revival series.

631
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:00,940
By then,

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,200
I'll send you all a pair,

633
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,230

635
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,850
Who will design

636
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,450
the Revival series?

637
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,440
Well...

638
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,950
I'll keep you in suspense,

639
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,330
but I promise

640
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,930
our designer

Ms. Jiang,

643
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,920
you're teasing us again.

Thank you for your hard work today.

Let's toast.

646
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:25,890
Thank you.

647
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,820
Thank you.

648
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,160
Hello?

649
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,230
A video was uploaded

650
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,300
on Teng Yue's website.

651
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,970
I see.

652
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:43,820
Let me take a look.

653
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,710
And then?

654
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,980
Okay, I got it.

655
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,570
I'll check over here.

656
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,050
Okay.

Let's go and have a look.

659

We don't know know them.

660
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,880
It's not appropriate.

661
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,140
No one knows us.

662
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,230
Let's go dance.

663
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,360
This isn't good.

664
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,320
Let's go.

665
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:58,720
Let's go.

666
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,930
Sorry.

667
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,830
It's okay.

Didn't you dance

669
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,080
very well last time?

670
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,470
Why are you

671
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,670
so hesitant this time?

672
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,430
Thank you

673
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,550

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,320
I'm indeed lenient toward you.

If you do this,

how to face you in the future.

762
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,650
What are you talking about?

763
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,540
I said I wanted to pursue you,

764
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,670
so there's no need

765
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,910
for us to put on airs anymore.

766
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,910
Consider me.

767
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,520
I can't consider now.

768
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,780
Can you go back first?

769
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:53,950
Okay.

770
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,650
I'll wait for your reply.
