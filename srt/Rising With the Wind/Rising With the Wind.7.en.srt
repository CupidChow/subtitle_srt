Many things

00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,750
don't depend on

7
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,830
their compatibility with me,

8
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,750
but my desire.

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,670
So?

10
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,560
I want to rent Teng Yue's land.

11
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,270
You're really

12
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,630
surprising me again and again today.

13
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,830
About K32's price,

14
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,380
you've yet to reach an agreement with Yuanfeng, right?

15
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,580
Or

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,170
their funds are limited

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,220
and they need a middleman?

18
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,919
I think it won't take long.

19
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,200
Why don't you take advantage of this time difference

20
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,340
and rent Teng Yue to me?

21
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,670
You can even earn some rent.

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,750
I doubt Teng Yue's rent for a year

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,110
is within the scope of funds

24
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,010
that you can mobilize.

25
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,150
Yes.

26
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,670
I don't have the money right now.

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,950
But as long as you rent Teng Yue

28
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,590
to me,

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,790
Teng Yue can

30
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,950
resume production.

31
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,120
One year.

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,920
Give me one year.

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,550
I'll pay you back the rent with interest

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,590
according to the bank's financial product

35
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,870
with the highest

36
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,510
interest rate.

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,570
Jiang Hu.

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,310
Is there

39
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,930
a word written on my forehead?

40
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,590
"Pushover"?

41
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,160
So you understand.

42
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,950
I do.

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,280
Anyone can be a pushover.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,510
But it's impossible for you, Xu Si,

45
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,510
to be a pushover.

46
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,230
I beg you.

47
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,950
Please... Please don't say

48
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,390
and do something like this.

49
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,400
This doesn't suit our relationship dynamic.

50
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,790
Relationship dynamic?

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,110
What do you mean?

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,310
Like how you scolded me.

53
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,690
I can be despicable,

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,890
but you can't be easy.

55
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,900
You know your place.

56
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,870
Jiang Hu.

57
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,740
The things you're doing now,

58
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,930
whether it be following me

59
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,660
or trying to run Teng Yue,

60
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,270
do not suit you.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,670
You don't trust me?

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,190
Xu Si.

63
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm discussing this

64
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,540
seriously with you.

65
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,660
I will keep my promise.

66
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,550
Also, Teng Yue's situation is not as bad

67
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,350
as you think.

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,360
Teng Yue was a national sports shoes brand

69
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,550
that ranked first in terms of sales

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,680
throughout the entire 80s.

71
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,070
As you said,

72
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,730
that was during the 80s of the last millennium.

73
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:20,779
Jiang Hu.

74
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,850
I'm also

75
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,470
seriously and sincerely suggesting that you...

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,520
cancel your C Club membership.

77
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,670
You can get back

78
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,200
a considerable amount of the membership fee.

79
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,620
This is a goal that's easier to achieve.

80
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,580
Think about it calmly.

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,909
Don't come to me again.

82
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,670
Spend your time

83
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,350
on Teng Yue's move-out,

84
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,230
okay?

[Baoxing Investment]

86
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,060
He had a meeting the day before yesterday, yesterday,

87
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
and he's having another today.

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,670
Do you think I believe you?

89
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,520
Do I look gullible

90
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,550
to you?

91
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,720
Can you put in more effort

92
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,909
in making up your excuses?

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,990
What's wrong?

94
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,820
Are you hungry?

95
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,100
Try this.

96
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,510
This orange-flavored one is very delicious.

97
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,150
You don't want it?

98
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,470
Hello.

99
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,060
Hello.

100
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,230
May I ask where Mr. Xu

101
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,710
went for his meeting today?

102
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,520
Sorry, I don't know.

103
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,170
Okay.

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,960
Thank you.

105
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,910
I'll head over there right now.

106
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,600
Thank you.

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,710
What were you talking about? Why did you thank her?

108
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,660
You told her?

109
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,230
Who told you to tell her

110
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,150
that Mr. Xu went to TT Media?

111
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,320
What about TT Media?

112
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,480

when I

164
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,990
hired

165
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,350
such a precious car-show model.

166
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,620
I've been waiting for you here

167
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,540
for a whole day.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,750
Ms. Jiang.

169
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,190
Since you gave up your high heels

170
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,350
and started wearing sneakers,

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,340
your height is gone.

172
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,470
Your sense of humor

173
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,830
also disappeared without a trace.

174
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,810
Don't be sarcastic.

175
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,830
I really didn't expect

176
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,350
you to actually come all the way to this place.

177
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,850
All right, Ms. Jiang.

178
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,270
It’s cold.

179
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,470

You're really telling a huge joke.

183
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,990
I've been working all day.

184
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm too tired.

185
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,810
It's fine. How about this?

186
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,070
Tomorrow morning,

187
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,510
I'll look for you at your company early in the morning.

188
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,980
I just need 15 minutes.

189
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,790
Okay?

190
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,130
Tomorrow,

191
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm going somewhere to have a full day's meeting.

192
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:47,710
Well,

193
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,990
then when are you free?

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,540
This meeting

195
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,710
will last

196
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,350
for days.

197
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,780
I'll wait for you at the company tomorrow.

198
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,650
Until you're willing

199
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,770
to discuss business with me.

200
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,290
You and Jiang Hu must have known each other before.

201
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,830
We were

202
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,830
classmates in middle school and high school.

203
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,950
But you two

204
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,110
don't seem close.

205
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,780
I don't quite get along with her.

206
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,350
I heard that

207
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,260
she learned French

208
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,480
in just half a year.

209
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,860
Is that true?

210
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,630
That's nothing.

211
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,470
In the past,

212
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,130
in order to finish her handicraft class assignment,

213
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,730
she didn't let anyone help her.

214
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,190
In the end, her hands were pricked so much that they looked like sieves

215
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,400
and even got inflamed

216
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,200
with blood blisters.

217
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
It took a long time to recover.

218
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,370
She's harsh on herself.

219
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,970
That's her style.

220
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,710
You don't have a close relationship

221
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,440
but you seem to

222
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,710
know her quite well.

223
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,830
Dad.

224
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,830
Is there really

225
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,290
a god in this world?

228
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,390
Okay, this round of video filming is over.

229
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,170
Let's move on to the next round.

231
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,990
Thank you.

232
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,510
You're welcome.

233
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,420
We need to adjust that camera.

234
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,150
Okay, hurry up.

235
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,500
They're letting her use Studio 1 again today

236
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,350
and they asked us to shoot in Studio 3.

237

Studio 3 and Studio 2

238
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,190

You know that.

Hello, Zheng.

246
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,110
Help me contact

00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,830
someone from TT Media.

248
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,190
Mr. Gao.

249
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,710
Take this into consideration then.

250
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,990
Free Unicorn was founded

251
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,450
by your godfather, Jiang Qisheng.

252
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,110
Mr. Zhang.

253
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,920
The department store industry is now in collective decline.

254
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,010
An old brand like Lidu will be facing

255
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,520
greater market pressure.

256
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,190
These brands that are placed

00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,990

259
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,480
the taste and image of our store.

260
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,000
So you mean

261
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,400
that Free Unicorn is not qualified

262
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,569
to rent a store on the first floor?

263
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,109
Moving Free Unicorn

264
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,690
to the casual clothing area on the second floor

265
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,630
is not necessarily

266
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,430
a bad thing to you.

267
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,490
The rent is lower

268
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,520
and the target customers are more concentrated.

269
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,710
I think

270
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,790
you should be able to weigh the pros and cons clearly.

271
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,569
Mr. Gao, what great timing.

272
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,780
Our lease on the first floor is expiring,

273
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,190
so we have no choice even if you don't renew the contract.

274
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,710
I've said what I should.

275
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,430
Goodbye.

How about this?

Free Unicorn will do you a favor

282
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,610
and move to the second floor.

283
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,830

As long as...

381
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,510
As long as you sell the factory's

382
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,550
20,000 pairs of shoes,

383
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,910
I'll rent the factory building to you.

384
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,340
Will you state this in the contract?

385
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,270
When I go back,

386
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,140
I'll ask the legal department to draft the contract.

387
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,760
Okay?

388
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,080
Come here first.

389
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,070
Come here.

390
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,340
Come on.

391
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,810
Who filmed this?

392
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,070
How despicable.

393
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,060
It made me look so terrifying.

394
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,430
It must be those onlookers.

395
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,330
You've really taken everything into consideration.

396
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,300
How dare I not take everything into consideration

397
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,310
when I'm

398
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,270
discussing business

399
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,230
with Boss Xu?

400
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,220
If I disagree,

401
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,860
you will upload these videos

402
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,920
online.

403
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,010
That way,

404
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,420
my reputation will be damaged.

405
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,410
Once my reputation is damaged,

406
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,330
Baoxing's reputation

407
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,440
will also be damaged.

408
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,320
It will also affect

409
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,990
other projects in Baoxing Investment.

410
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,790
You created

411
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,750
a very dramatic situation

412
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,930
where one move triggers a full-blown crisis.

413
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,390
You are waiting for me to walk into the PR nightmare.

414
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,140
Jiang Hu.

415
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,470
No.

416
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,820
Ms. Jiang.

417
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,390
You sure are unscrupulous.

418
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,350
I told you

419
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,870
that I have no choice.

420
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,150
Without a choice,

421
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,600
I have only one way.

422
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,390
Just post it online if you want.

423
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,470
You don't care?

424
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,670
Is one video is enough?

425
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,550
There are other selfies

426
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,310
in my phone.

427
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,050
There are many selfies

428
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,910
of my good figure.

429
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,140
Didn't you add me on WeChat?

430
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,390
I'll send them all to you later.

431
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,260
With a two-pronged approach,

432
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,450
it's easier to become famous.

433
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,720
You make me feel

434
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,290
like my threat is a joke.

435
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,820
You're half right.

436
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,310
I really hate

437
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,270
being threatened indeed.

438
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,170
And once I compromise once,

439
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,630
it will become a habit.

440
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,460
As for the other half...

441
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,030
I admit

442
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,690
you are a smart person,

443
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,760
but your method is too foolish.

444
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,990
The land Teng Yue's at currently

445
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,620
costs over 1.5 million per year for rent.

446
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,440
It'll cost around three million for two years.

447
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,630
But you need to pay three years' worth of rent.

448
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,530
Why?

449
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,870
For factory buildings,

450
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,160
it's an industry rule to pay a year's rent in advance.

451
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,910
Why are you willing

452
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,230
to return to the negotiation table?

453
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,400
I hate being threatened,

454
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,000
but obviously,

455
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,200
I still have the right to take the initiative.

456
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,550
Xu Si.

457
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,270
I don't care

458
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,520
what your reason is,

459
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,510
but you know

460
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,670
my difficulties.

461
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,150
At this point,

462
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,310
bringing such conditions up

463
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,910
is really pointless.

464
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,190
For the payment, I'm willing to

465
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,190
pay you according to the highest interest rate

466
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,510
of the financial product among the four major banks.

467
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,080
I'll even double it. I promise you.

468
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,870
As long as you allow me to pay at the end of the year.

469
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,990
We can state everything

470
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,230
in the contract.

471
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,630
You're being a rogue

472
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,750
by discussing business like this.

473
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,480
That's because I'm desperate.

474
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,130
What if I don't want to?

475
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm begging you.

476
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,230
Fine.

477
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,790
Although

478
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,170
it's not an high-interest loan...

479
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,160
Based on your empty words,

480
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,230
I can't trust that I can get the money back

481
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,680
from Teng Yue under your management

482
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,390
in one to two years.

483
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,210
I need evidence

484
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,410
to prove that you are reliable.

485
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,550
Then tell me,

486
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,080
what should I do

487
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,040
to make you confident in me?

488
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,510
Give me

489
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,910
a proposal about reviving Teng Yue.

490
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,140
Then we can discuss it again.

491
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,070
Are you talking about

492
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,950
a serious discussion?

493
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,790
Neither of us will play tricks this time.

494
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,080
Let's discuss seriously.

495
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,750
Your makeup skills were good,

496
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,870
especially your speed.

497
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,650
Come on.

498
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,360
I really didn't expect

499
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,480
you to agree to it.

500
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,700
This is not like you.

501
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
You've never been threatened.

502
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
There are hundreds of reasons

503
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,470
to reject her.

504
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,880
Jiang Hu's unyielding perseverance

505
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,990
and adventurous spirit

506
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,550
must have been inherited from Jiang Qisheng.

507
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,430
What do you mean? I don’t understand.

508
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,130
Give her a chance

509
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,960
to be utterly convinced to admit defeat.

510
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,510
Are you Zhaoyang?

511
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,540
Yes.

512
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,390
You are...

513
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,230
We don't know each other.

514
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:11,870
But I've seen

515
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,950
the videos you've filmed.

516
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,310
I think they're so stylish.

517
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,710
Even better than advertisements.

518
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,150
I watch every episode.

519
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,950
Thank you.

520
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,510
By the way,

521
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,380
I even specially bought

522
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,690
the bag you hand-painted.

523
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,870
But I think I'll have to starve

524
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,490
for this month.

525
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,640
Thank you.

526
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,460
But I have to go to work.

527
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,230
It's okay.

528
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,310
I just think

529
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,950
I'm really lucky

530
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,310
to run into you.

531
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,150
I can brag to my friends

532
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,510
for a month.

533
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,770
You're really great.

534
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,070
By the way,

535
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,710
when will you

536
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,430
release new works?

537
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,070
Hello, who are you looking for?

538
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,960
It's okay.

539
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,230
Zhaoyang, all the best.

540
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,710
I will follow up

541
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,990
with your new work.

542
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,750
I'll keep paying attention to you.

543
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,310
Bye.

544
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,530
-Thank you.
-Work hard.

545
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,590
Bye bye.

546
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,830
Come on, Zhaoyang!

547
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,670
Are we exaggerating?

548
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,310
In just a few days,

549
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,040
Zhaoyang's follower count

550
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,370
has exploded to 1 million.

551
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,850
It's all thanks to Ms. Song,

552
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,190
that the brands recognize

553
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,990
Zhaoyang's videos.

554
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,510
Mainly, the direction of Zhaoyang's videos

555
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,430
is very clear.

556
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,270
Zhaoyang.

557
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,950
I told you you wouldn't go wrong if you followed my instructions.

558
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,230
Thank you, Ms. Song.

559
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,520
What's the situation of the brands

560
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,470
working with Zhaoyang's livestreams?

561
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,070
As of now, 18 brands have already

562
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,410
contacted us.

563
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,230
Among them,

564
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,270
three cosmetics brands

565
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,310
are our regular customers.

566
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,360
These are the WeChat Business brands

567
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,360
that frequently worked with Tao Xiaoying and Nan, right?

568
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,230
Yes.

569
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,230
They are very sincere

570
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,470
in supporting our newcomer.

571
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,390
Their brand styles

572
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,000
are not suitable for Zhaoyang's direction.

573
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,540
These three are famous local brands.

574
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,070
But the quotation is very ordinary.

575
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,760
[Lidu Department Store] [Mingzhe Company] [Guang Si Ji Qu]

576
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,070
At this stage,

577
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,280
what's important is the partner,

578
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,230
not the price.

579
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,230
We need to emphasize the correlation

580
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,790
between her style and the brand's style.

581
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,910
Lidu Department Store?

582
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,270
I choose Lidu.

583
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,150
What's the reason?

584
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,520
The reason is simple.

585
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,590
The direction of Zhaoyang's videos is very clear.

586
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,770
The brand style that was revealed

587
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,840
is also very consistent.

588
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,389
After being recognized by the brand,

589
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,080
our transformation will be very effective.

590
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,989
It fits Lidu's direction of rebranding

591
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,870
into a young and casual brand.

592
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,800
Besides, judging from the video's

593
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,060
communication dimension,

594
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,630
TT Media is investing

595
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,060
all their resources in her videos

596
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,860
to promote her.

597
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,400
If we work with her,

598
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,590
it'll be like working with

599
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,699
more than half of the influencers

600
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,949
of TT Media.

601
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,870
But TT Media

602
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,989
hasn't replied us yet.

603
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:34,929
Don't worry.

604
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,030
They will agree.

605
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,590
Let's choose Lidu.

606
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,990
Lidu's performance has been poor these two years

607
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,750
and has closed down

608
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,820
two or three stores.

609
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,880
Have you been to Lidu recently?

610
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,950
Lidu's investment structure is too complicated

611
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,940
and there's nothing special.

612
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,780
Every time I went there,

613
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,110
I couldn't find anything I wanted to buy

614
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,480
nor did I buy anything.

615
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,490
Three months ago,

616
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,510
Lidu transferred over a vice president in charge of

617
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,430
market management and investment

618
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,590
from their Hong Kong headquarters.

619
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,210
The first thing he did after taking charge of Lidu

620
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,080
was to adjust the investment structure

621
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,810
to attract the currently popular

622
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,810
local and foreign trendy brands.

623
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,370
I went there yesterday.

624
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,840
I thought I went to the wrong place.

625
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,390
I didn't expect so many people there

626
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,280
after renovation.

627
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:31,790
Yes.

628
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,030
This should just be the prelude of Lidu.

629
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,630
Working with Lidu, Xiang Zhaoyang

630
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,550
can indirectly

631
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,510
be correlated with

632
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,630
Lidu's brand.

633
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,510
It's a kind of effect

634
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,070
where one plus one is greater than two.

635
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,750
Which other brand can achieve this?

636
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,670
Mr. Xu.

637
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,950
Were you trying to get my attention

638
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,730
or to reunite?

639
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,120
What do you mean?

640
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,470
Why did you constantly

641
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,870
pick on me just now?

642
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:00,870
I don't think

643
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,990
I'm that annoying.

644
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,340
So I can only interpret it as

645
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,430
you trying to get my attention

646
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,580

649
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,310
Can't you not embarrass me

650
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,590
in front of the subordinates?

651
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,390
After all, we used to

652
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,520
be in a relationship.

653
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,430
Can't you treat me

654
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,570
a little differently?

655
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,190

757
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,820
How is the business?

758
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:56,790
Not bad.

759
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,110
We didn't get enough noodles yesterday.

760
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,000
I gave you a ton of noodles

761
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,300
yesterday.

762
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,390
I'm not

763
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,210
as clever in doing business as you.

764
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,750
Well...

765
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,710
By the way,

766
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,480
the slaughterhouse told me to raise the price tomorrow.

767
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,630
Raise the price?

768
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:16,990
Raise the price.

769
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,700
Don't, Liu.

770
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,270
How can you raise the price?

771
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,550
It's not up to me.

772
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,870
Right now, the price of pork belly

773
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,870
per 500 grams is spiking.

774
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,300
I can't afford the cost.

775
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,750
Don't raise the price.

776
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,150
Don't cry about being poor.

777
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,700
I know you well.

778
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,950
I don't make any money.

779
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,250
I really don't make any money.

780
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,430
Forget it.

781
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,460
Pick one for me.

782
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,930
This one is good.

783
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,050
Look. Is it okay?

784
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,000
Sure.

785
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:44,790
Okay.

786
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,520
I'll weigh it for you.

787
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,040
Okay.

788
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,640
I've tidied it up for you.

789
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,310
Just make do with it.

790
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,670
Tidy up a bit.

791
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,130
Well,

792
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,560
You won't stay here for long anyway.

793
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,110
How little faith do you have

794
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,170
in your niece?

795
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,690
No, no, no.

796
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,190
Well,

797
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,260
you know what kind of situation

798
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,360
Teng Yue is in now.

799
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,410
Even if you successfully negotiate

800
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,360
the deal about the land,

801
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,270
how much is the rent of one year

802
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,480
that Xu Si is asking for?

803
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,710
Can you get the money?

804
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,310
As long as he gives me a chance.

805
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,470
In the past, Teng Yue's

806
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,750
OEM business

807
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,350
was provided by Free Unicorn.

808
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,890
Now, it's gone.

809
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,220
It's gone.

810
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,320
There's nothing left.

811
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,090
In addition, right now, there are dozens of people

812
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,990
in our factory

813
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,780
whose salaries need to be paid every month.

814
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,450
Also,

815
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,350
the factory's rent for one year cost millions.

816
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,960
Only costs and no profits.

817
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,960
This is not a chance.

818
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,970
This is a pit.

819
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,780
An endless pit.
