5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,600
Teng Yue hasn't launched

6
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,580
any new design yet.

7
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,750
We are still relying on

8
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,320
the old design in different shoelace colors.

9
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,590
Our distribution channels are also limited to

10
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,720
online stores, community supermarkets,

11
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,300
and group buying.

12
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,420
We aren't able to withstand

13
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,630
the pressure caused by the price rise at all.

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,950
We can only try to find a way

15
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,160
to control costs as much as possible

16
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,620
at the current stage.

17
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,470
Let's change the raw materials then.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,120
Rubber,

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,440
lace holes, insoles,

20
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,220
and canvas.

21
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,400
I know a few factories that produce these.

22
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,830
The outcome will be the same,

23
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,250
but the cost can be reduced

24
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,750
by 5%.

25
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,210
But the old suppliers

26
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,040
are more reliable, right?

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,480
After all, we've worked with them for so many years.

28
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,310
We can try to talk them down.

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,660
Given the current situation,

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,530
who would still care about their history with us?

31
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:34,900
Mr. Pei.

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,640
Are you sure you can talk them down?

33
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,910
If there's no increase in quantity,

34
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,770
who would want to negotiate with us?

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,790
How about

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,270
you go talk to them?

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,220
It's okay if you don't want a new supplier.

38
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,300
But if we want to reduce the cost,

39
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,360
as the production director,

40
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,510
I can't think of any other solution.

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,520
Nowadays, technology is

42
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,020
changing and evolving very fast.

43
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,130
We may as well give it a try.

44
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,540
Are the qualifications of those factories

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,870
and the quality of their products reliable?

46
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,770
Of course.

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,950
Think about it.

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,430
How can I do harm to our own factory?

49
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,210
Okay.

50
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,829
Let's do it then.

51
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,630
Go contact them.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,040
Okay.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,400
Master Zhang.

54
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,320
Technology is your specialty.

55
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,070
Strictly control the quality.

56
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,470
No problem.

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
Do you have anything else to say, Uncle?

58
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,550
No.

59
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,850
Okay, that's all for today then.

60
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,030
Wait.

61
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,760
I have something to talk to you later.

62
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,290
We need to make a decision on the designer as soon as possible.

63
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,610
I gave you a batch of resumes before.

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,410
Do you like any of them?

65
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,850
They're all good,

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,910
but they are not suitable for Teng Yue.

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,320
What kind of designer

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,370
do you want then?

69
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,230
He should have his own

70
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,890
concept and style of design.

71
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,250
But more importantly,

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,240
his works should bear

73
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,670
similarities to Teng Yue's essence.

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,920
Besides,

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,810
he should know Teng Yue's history very well.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,430
Do you already have someone in mind?

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,800
Xiang Zhaoyang.

78
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,420
She's a KOL who got viral for

79
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,640
freehand painting.

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,090
I've been observing her for a long time.

81
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,510
She's been doing on-site freehand painting

82
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,020
in Lidu these days.

83
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,790
What she's been drawing is Teng Yue's shoes.

84
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,430
Her style is what I want.

85
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,220
She also won the St. Laurent Design Competition

86
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,520
for her design in Aneda before.

87
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,950
That design is very interesting.

88
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,920
I know her.

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,590
But I heard that

90
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,030
she signed a two-year non-compete agreement

91
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,570
with Aneda

92
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,180
for taking on

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,650
a commercial project of Free Unicorn before.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,430
Ms. Yue.

95
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,370
I finally know

96
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,430
how it feels

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,770
to shoot myself in the foot.

98
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,660
It's okay.

99
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,930
You can do it.

100
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,880
I didn't expect

101
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,530
Mr. Gao Yi of Lidu Department Store

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,590
is also good at marketing.

103
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,990
He came up with the creative idea of

104
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,030
letting the citizens draw freely on the white fencing shade cloth

105
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,050
used in the second-phase redecoration of the store,

106
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,120
and combined it with

107
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,620
Zhaoyang's 3-day on-site freehand painting livestream.

108
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,590
All the brands in the store

109
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,030
are included in the painting.

110
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,940
It's so well planned and popular.

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,150
How's the data?

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,910
There are more than

113
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,520
5,000 videos

114
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,910
under the keyword "Lidu Department Store".

115
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,270
A journalist from Morning News

116
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,330
just went there to shoot some footage.

117
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,260
Judging by the current trend

118
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,500
of data increase,

119
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,450
when she posts the video herself later,

120
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,770
she'll definitely get over a million likes.

121
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,510
You did well this time.

122
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,570
It's not easy

123
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,730
to get your compliment, Mr. Xu.

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,840
I'm hanging up.

125
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,900
My boss is driving for me.

126
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,550
Why do I feel like

127
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,950
I'll have to resign tomorrow?

128
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,390
I've already driven

129
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,550
over 100 kilometers.

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,640
Where's your resignation report?

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,909
I'm here

132
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,040
to do the program research

133
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,180
on new energy vehicles

134
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
on behalf of Joey, okay?

135
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,210
I'm very serious.

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,230
But what about your original job?

137
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,710
How's Teng Yue doing recently?

138
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,020
Very bad, I'm afraid.

139
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,700
The sales went back down

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,630
to earth overnight.

141
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,250
Ms. Jiang

142
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,580
came up with a new idea.

143
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,460
She launched

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,320
a new series of colored shoelaces.

145
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,470
It's said to be a transition

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,980
before new products are launched.

147
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,790
[Teng Yue]

148
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,740
Liu.

149
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,190
I've got you a job.

150
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,659
I went through a great amount of trouble

151
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,250
to get this order for your factory.

152
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,990
You get me.

153
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
Fixed price.

154
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,909
Don't you go back on your word.

155
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,460
Okay.

156
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,350
I'm hanging up.

157
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,190
This is the schedule

158
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,140
for this week.

159
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,850
Oh right, one more thing.

160
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,350
Alan from FW

161
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,790
asked me

162
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,810
about your opinions

163
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,610
on their

164
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,550
creative ideas.

165
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,230
They are waiting for your reply.

166
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,040
What matters now

167
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,680
is not

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
how we feel about their plan.

169
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,480
Has Teng Yue handed in their financial report?

170
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,300
Yes.

171
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,040
I called them,

172
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,900
and they handed it in immediately.

173
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,090
Let me tell you.

174
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,090
This time, Ms. Jiang

175
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,990
must have tried

176
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,120
her best.

177
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,630
The payment of Free Unicorn's order

178
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:30,990
has been transferred

179
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,930
to Teng Yue's account.

180
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,890
But there's one problem.

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,280
The profit is too low.

182
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,429
I'm sure Zhang Wenshan

183
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,400
is no philanthropist.

184
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,590
I hope Jiang Hu

185
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,960
can make the best use of this money.

186
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,880
By the way,

187
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,690
what's her work schedule like

188
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
these days?

189
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,710
Don't get me started.

190
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,060
This is the first time

191
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,820
we've asked

192
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,940
our founder

193
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,180
to submit her itinerary.

194
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,110
When I told her about this,

195
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,880
she asked me

196
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,550
who I am to ask about her itinerary.

197
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,620
I knew

198
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,980
she would react like that.

199
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,910
But even though she questioned me,

200
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,250
she handed it in as ordered.

201
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Over the past couple of days,

202
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,460
she's been doing market research.

203
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,200
From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., 7 days a week, no days off.

204
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,700
She's been working too hard.

205
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,830
This is what starting a business should be like.

206
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,150
How can she win without fighting?

207
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,560
Bravo!

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,600
Bravo!

209
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,870
Lord Zhaoyang!

210
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,870
Bravo!

211
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,000
It's so beautiful.

212
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,190
Jiang Hu is here.

213
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,250
Why didn't she

214
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,820
come over to say hello to you?

215
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,290
You didn't, either.

216
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,160
What happened?

217
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,640
Why is it so weird

218
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,730
between you two?

219
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,520
Thank you for your hard work over the past three days.

220
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,900
I'll introduce you to some brands.

221
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,150
They're grateful that

222
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,540
you included them in the painting.

223
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,300
They want to talk to you.

224
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,360
Okay.

225
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,010
Let's go.

226
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,790
Okay.

227
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,880
Me first.

228
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,470
This way.

229
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,720
Look here.

230
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,600
Jiang Hu.

231
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,550
Are you here

232
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,250
specially to visit Free Unicorn?

233
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,110
It's all in your head.

234
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,380
I was just passing by.

235
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,340
We were friends for so many years.

236
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,420
I know you well, okay?

237
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,110
You're worried that

238
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,230
Wenshan can't run Free Unicorn well.

239
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,880
Don't worry.

240
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,440
I heard from Wenshan that

241
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,110
Free Unicorn

242
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,370
is doing very well.

243
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,960
By the way,

244
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,340
the new product launch show is around the corner.

245
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,400
Make sure to come and support us if you have time.

246
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,730
I'll show you

247
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,300
a brand new Free Unicorn.

248
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:38,960
If time permits.

249
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,960
Since we met,

250
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,480
let's go

251
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,680
for afternoon tea.

252
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
Alice.

253
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,680
That's inconsiderate of you.

254
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,950
Jiang Hu is a factory girl

255
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,670
who lives in the factory now.

256
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,220
How could she possibly have time

257
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,750
to have afternoon tea with us?

258
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,160
Am I right, Jiang Hu?

259
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,900
Since you know I'm busy,

260
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,420
please move aside.

261
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,190
You're in my way.

262
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,760
My shoelaces are loose again, Jiang Hu.

263
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,630
Tie them for me.

264
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,490
Show me again.

265
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,560
Do you want me to get some 502 Super Glue

266
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,930
to stick the shoes on your feet?

267
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,130
Do you like

268
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,350
wearing other people's shoes so much?

269
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,620
Coming right up.

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,150
It's done.

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,760
Here.

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,820
Try it.

273
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,510
It's done?

274
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,110
Well...

275
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,410
The appearance of it

276
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,420
is not very good.

277
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,490
As long as

278
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,970
it tastes good.

279
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,990
Try it.

280
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,350
How is it?

281
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,130
Not bad.

282
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,580
It's cooked.

283
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,580
Didn't you say it doesn't taste good?

284
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,380
Why do you keep eating?

285
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,410
It's called listening to others' advice.

286
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,300
Besides,

287
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,240
it's rare for you to cook fish for me.

288
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,110
Of course I should show you my support.

289
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,290
I'm your stan.

290
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,990
I plan to become a shareholder of Xufeng.

291
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,390
Really?

292
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,750
As long as you are willing,

293
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,040
I can hand the entire factory

294
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,050
over to you.

295
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,590
Talking about becoming a shareholder.

296
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,640
Let's eat.

297
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,070
I'm an investor.

298
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm only in charge of payment,

299
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,070
not the actual operation of the enterprises.

300
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,610
Fine.

301
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,700
I know

302
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,280
you're worried that

303
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,900
you won't be able to pay the year-end bonuses.

304
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,210
As long as the year-end bonuses are guaranteed,

305
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,010
you'll go to the hospital

306
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,550
and recuperate, right?

307
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,990
You're not buying shares.

308
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,270
It's more like charity, to some extent.

309
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,390
Mom.

310
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,150
Aunt and I are worried about you.

311
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,830
I don't want

312
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,870
your money.

313
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,710
My factory made it through

314
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,310
several decades like this.

315
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,390
I know

316
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,750
my own condition better than anyone.

317
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,660
You don't have to worry about me.

318
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,380
Give me some more time.

319
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,750
After I'm done with my work for this while,

320
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll go see a doctor.

321
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,710
Right.

322
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
After this while,

323
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,050
there will be a next while.

324
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,800
I know you too well.

325
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,370
If you keep stalling,

326
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,570
even small problems will become big problems.

327
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,870
I know my condition the best.

328
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,620
Besides,

329
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,850
I'm in charge of my own business.

330
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,760
It's fine if you don't want my money.

331
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,230
I'll find you

332
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,130
a professional manager.

333
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,620
I'll send you the information

334
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,040
as soon as I find a suitable one.

335
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,730
Those professional managers.

336
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,510
Those I like

337
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,780
ask for too high of a salary.

338
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,550
Those who don't mind working in small enterprises

339
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,740
know nothing.

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,160
I have to teach them everything from the start.

341
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,870
Forget it.

342
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,630
So nothing works.

343
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,740
What works for you, exactly?

344
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,790
I've told you.

345
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,830
After selling the inventory,

346
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,170
I'll go see a doctor.

347
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,140
After selling the inventory, I'll go see a doctor.

348
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,620
After selling the inventory, I'll go see a doctor.

349
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,280
Let's eat.

350
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,630
Song Zhi.

351
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,070
Is Anna livestreaming tomorrow?

352
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,080
Okay.

353
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,060
I'll send you

354
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,640
the information of a few products.

355
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,380
Okay.

356
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,400
I owe you one.

357
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,660
Bye.

358
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,160
After selling the inventory,

359
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,420
you'll go to see a doctor.

360
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,800
Dip it in vinegar.

361
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,850
It's delicious.

362
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,340
Zhaoyang.

363
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,590
What do you want to have?

364
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,300
Order whatever you like.

365
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,650
I've never been to this restaurant.

366
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,390
Why don't you order for me?

367
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,280
Okay.

368
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,530
Cold Pea Sprouts in Sauce.

369
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,550
Okay.

370
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,080
How about Stewed Pork Cubes and Tofu Skin in Brown Sauce?

371
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,280
Sure.

372
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,310
Get that.

373
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,190
How about

374
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,160
Steamed Sea Bass?

375
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,220
Sure.

376
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,180
Okay.

377
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,830
Gao Yi.

378
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,060
It's just the two of us.

379
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,910
You don't have to

380
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,550
order that much.

381
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,940
I'll add a dessert then.

382
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,350
Strawberry cheesecake, please.

383
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,010
Thank you.

384
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,500
How do you know

385
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,080
I like strawberry cake?

386
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,370
I heard it from Jiang Hu before.

387
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,470
When you went to learn farming in Qingpu

388
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,840
during senior high,

389
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,350
she fought with you for strawberry cake.

390
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,470
You two have

391
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,470
quite similar tastes.

392
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,630
Yes.

393
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,220
Our preferences

394
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,710
are indeed quite similar.

395
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,400
We both like strawberries,

396
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,950
we like the same songs,

397
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,620
and we both like...

398
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,430
Have some tea.

399
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,580
Thank you.

400
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,040
What do you think about

401
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,780
today's event?

402
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,990
It's my first time

403
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,120
doing such a long painting.

404
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,030
I forgot to congratulate you.

405
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,110
Your design

406
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,680
won the Silver Award at St. Laurent Design Competition.

407
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,620
You saw my design?

408
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,350
Aneda is also a brand

409
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,200
in our department store.

410
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,470
It's been KEL's OEM

411
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,430
for 30 years.

412
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,470
But their design style

413
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,020
is greatly influenced

414
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,880
by the style of European and American sneakers.

415
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,430
I think you are very good at

416
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,980
using Chinese-style design elements.

417
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,900
It doesn't really match

418
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,870
their brand style.

419
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,100
You think so too?

420
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,630
Actually,

421
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,370
I do feel sorry about

422
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,900
your resignation from Aneda.

423
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,510
But don't blame Jiang Hu for this.

424
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,550
She does have a

425
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,650
rather flamboyant personality.

426
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,030
And she does tend

427
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,380
to go out of line from time to time.

428
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,620
But she never means any harm.

429
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,820
Back then,

430
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,270
I did blame her for a while.

431
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,770
But

432
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,980
after what happened

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,290
to her family,

434
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,570
I also think

435
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,630
there's no need

436
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,770
to blame her anymore.

437
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,040
Things are quite difficult for her now.

438
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,880
She finally managed to rent the factory

439
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,930
from the investors,

440
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,860
but at the cost of equity swap.

441
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,290
To make it worse,

442
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,950
she's facing the risk

443
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,980
of everything being taken away from her

444
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,040
all the time.

445
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,590
So Baoxing's investors

446
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,090
put a lot of pressure on her?

447
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,030
Didn't Jiang Hu tell you?

448
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,390
Hello.

449
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,630
The Steamed Sea Bass,

450
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,040
Stewed Pork Cubes and Tofu Skin in Brown Sauce,

451
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,060
Cold Pea Sprouts in Sauce,

452
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,900
and strawberry cheesecake you ordered.

453
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,310
Please enjoy.

454
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,840
You're back.

455
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,670
You must be hungry.

456
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,110
Wash your hands and eat.

457
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,230
So many dishes.

458
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,960
I have a date today. I'm not having dinner at home.

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,370
What a waste.

460
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,560
Even if you won't come back to eat,

461
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,740
Zhaoyang will.

462
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,930
She's not coming back.

463
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,700
She's on a date.

464
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,040
A date?

465
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,560
With whom?

466
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,010
You know her.

467
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,510
If she doesn't want to tell,

468
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,220
no one can figure it out.

469
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,850
But

470
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,430
since I have many years of

471
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,440
romantic experience,

472
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,190
I can tell at a glance.

473
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,080
She must be in love.

474
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,750
Look what she's been like recently.

475
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,540
The way she's been dressing up.

476
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,680
She must like

477
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,230
that guy very much.

478
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,020
Jian, tell me.

479
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,340
What kind of man

480
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,050
can she like so much?

481
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,800
You know,

482
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,070
Zhaoyang

483
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,870
suffered a lot growing up

484
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,960
by my side.

485
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,070
I just hope

486
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,100
she can find

487
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,280
a decent man

488
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,000
and live a decent life.

489
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,030
Don't choose a wrong guy

490
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,820
like me.

491
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,890
This is called a bad investment, right?

492
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,230
So many dishes.

493
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,870
What a waste.

494
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,350
Hello?

495
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,660
What are you doing?

496
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,040
You work so hard.

497
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,100
Take care of yourself.

498
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,690
I know you must be tired.

499
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,520
So I specially

500
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,560
made late-night snacks for you.

501
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,920
I made stewed pork cubes,

502
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,260
pea sprouts, and fish.

503
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,990
Oh really?

504
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,340
You'll come very soon, right?

505
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:27,870
Okay.

506
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,820
I'll wait for you.

507
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,000
Also,

508
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,830
we can talk about your investment.

509
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,200
Bye.

510
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,990
Jian.

511
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,830
Well.

512
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,190
Is there anything else you need to do?

513
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,910
I'll leave then.

514
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,580
How about...

515
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,160
No, no, no.

516
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,830
I'm not kicking you out.

517
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,130
Why don't you have some?

518
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,830
No, thanks.

519
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,830
You guys eat.

520
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,130
Thank you.

521
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,690
You're welcome.

522
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,110
Bye. Take care.

523
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,550
I'm leaving.

Hello?

557
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,120
Have you adapted to it, living in the factory?

558
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,180
Gao Yi.

559
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,230
You don't have

560
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,460
to start our conversation like this.

561
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,580
Next week,

562
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,390
Lidu will hold an event

563
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,550
of Sports Festival Fair.

564
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,820
I'll give you the contact information

565
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,680
of the director of our Marketing Department.

566
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,320
We reserved

567
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,250
a booth for you.

568
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,510
The rent is not high,

569
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,490
and we can help you

570
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,880
publicize and promote your brand.

571
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,850
No need.

572
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,870
Don't rush to give me an answer.

573
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
There's nothing to answer.

574
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,940
Jiang Hu, now is not the time

575
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,070
to act on impulse.

576
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,400
Judging from Teng Yue's current situation,

577
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,840
you should learn

578
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,290
more about the market environment,

579
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,220
consumer groups,

580
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,600
and sales channels.

581
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,320
This is a very good opportunity.

582
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm trying to help you.

583
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,740
Gao Yi.

584
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,870
Look carefully.

585
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,640
I'm Jiang Qisheng's daughter.

586
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,110
You plotted and schemed

587
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,620
to lure my dad into a scam

588
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,110
and destroyed Free Unicorn.

589
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,100
Don't you just want

590
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,500
to see the Jiang family fall off the cliff

591
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,560
and never be able to get up?

592
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,610
Now you tell me you want to help me save Teng Yue?

593
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,170
Do I look like a fool to you,

594
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,680
or do you think

595
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,940
it's cool to have multiple personalities?

596
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,260
Yes.

597
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,390
You're right.

598
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
I'd be more than happy

599
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,930
if someone can help me now.

600
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,320
And I can accept

601
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,370
anyone's help.

602
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,350
I can even cooperate

603
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,610
with Xu Si and Zhang Wenshan.

604
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,670
But you are the only exception.

605
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,580
Gao Yi.

606
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,060
Do you need me

607
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,410
to explain the reason to you again?

608
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,520
The reason why

609
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,400
I'm still standing here and talking to you

610
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,310
is that I'm restraining myself.

611
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,950
I hope

612
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,610
you'll never show your face again

613
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,320
and remind me how pitiful I am.

614
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,910
[Welcome to C-Club]

615
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,860
Isn't this Ms. Jiang?

616
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,340
You must be lonely drinking alone.

617
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,580
Let me keep you company.

618
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,030
Get lost.

619
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,040
It's been so long,

620
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,510
yet your temper is still so bad.

621
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,960
You've drunk so much.

622
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,850
Come with me.

623
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,120
Get lost.

624
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,270
You are so...

625
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,500
Ms. Jiang doesn't have time to deal with you tonight.

626
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,570
Are you okay?

627
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,230
How much did you drink?

628
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,610
Let's go. I'll take you home.

629
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,730
Come on. Be careful.

630
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,560
Be careful, Jiang Hu.

631
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,640
Be careful.

632
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,960
You lost a button.

633
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:43,750
Forget it.

634
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,290
Who are you?

635
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,360
Who do you think I am?

636
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,670
Why are you still here?

637
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,350
Are you into me?

638
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,000
Say it.

639
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,350
What nonsense are you talking about?

640
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,710
I'm not talking nonsense.

641
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,390
I didn't mean to tell you this,

642
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,870
but things have been so hard for me.

643
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,340
-It's really hard for me.
-Keep your feet.

644
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,320
Why did you do that

645
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,420
to make me suffer?

646
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,900
What did I do?

647
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,480
I've been working so hard,

648
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,240
but I still can't get over you.

649
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,670
Gao Yi.

650
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,000
I can't get over you.

651
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,010
If...

652
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,190
I mean if.

653
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,920
If I had told you earlier,

654
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,890
things wouldn't have become

655
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,300
like this,

656
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,110
right?

657
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,360
Right?

658
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,050
See clearly who I am.

659
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,260
I like you.

660
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,760
Gao Yi.

661
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,120
I like you.

662
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,239
I like you.

663
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,110
You're drunk.

664
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,199
Little drunkard.

665
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,630
[Yue Shan]

666
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,820
Hello?

667
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,850
Jiang Hu.

668
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,980
What time is it now?

669
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,710
Where are you?

670
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,130
Why are you still not home?

671
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
This is Xu Si.

672
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,650
Be careful.

673
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,140
Yes, this room.

674
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,940
The door is open.

675
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,560
Why did she drink so much?

676
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,070
Let me.

677
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,240
I'm really sorry that

678
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,000
you have to take her back

679
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,430
at such a late hour.

680
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,430
I'll talk to her

681
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,350
when she wakes up tomorrow.

682
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,830
It's okay.

683
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,060
This kid has always been

684
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,230
rash and rude since she was little.

685
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,150
But things are different now.

686
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,820
It's not good to always trouble

687
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,640
her work partner.

688
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,070
My work partner is drunk.

689
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,600
It's no trouble for me

690
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,960
to bring her back.

691
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,210
It's getting late.

692
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,680
Why don't you go back and rest early?

693
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,050
-Okay.
-Let me see you off.

694
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,480

You're awake.

747
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,180
I prepared some new toiletries

for you

749
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,260

00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,290
Sorry, Ms. Yue.

751
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,220
Sorry that you had to pick me up

last night.

00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,550
You don't remember?

754
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,990
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.

755
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,600
Maybe I drank too much.

756
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,310
I blacked out.

757
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,800
Don't drink so much in the future.
