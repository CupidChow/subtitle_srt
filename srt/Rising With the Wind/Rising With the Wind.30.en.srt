Go on.

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,480
The only solution

192
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,560
is to find an OEM.

193
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,200
I think that's a good idea.

194
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,350
Liu Jun went to a factory.

195
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,740
We can talk to him.

196
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,250
Hurry

197
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,220
and give me Liu Jun's number.

198
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,800
Screw Liu Jun.

199

That ungrateful man.

You can work with anyone

but Liu Jun.

202
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,540
If we don't work with him,

203
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,240
then let me ask you,

204
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,490
can you find another partner to work with?

205
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,330
I came to you

206
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,810
with everything planned in my head.

207
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,760
Don't worry.

208

Don't worry.

209
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:55,890
Okay?

210
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,060
Well,

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,330
She's doing a media interview at Lidu.

213
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,550
Let's just wait then.

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,460
Okay.

215
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,220
Got it.

216
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,100
I thought of someone.

217

Is this real?

You like Zhaoyang so much...

that

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,260

Have you

228
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,990
made up your mind?

229
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,560

without telling us?

00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,440
It's so sudden.

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,390
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,570

00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:28,950
Why?

310
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,360
Is this a condemnation?

311
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,150
No.

312
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm just surprised.

313
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,690
I know Yang

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,140
definitely did it willingly.

315
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,010
But...

316
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,610
are you sincere?

317
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,970
I just don't want to miss my chance anymore.

318
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,290
So,

319
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,010
you should congratulate us.

320
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,600
Yes.

321
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,550
I must congratulate you.

322
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,520
But...

323
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,530
are you completely over Gao Yi?

324
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,420
When Zhaoyang comes back,

325
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,760
you two have to

326
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,870
explain everything.

327
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,100
What exactly is going on?

328
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,930
You two got married out of the blue

329
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,800
without even dating.

330
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,690
My relationship with Zhaoyang

331
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,930
is not out of the blue.

332
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,370
Don't worry.

333
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,920
I will be good to Zhaoyang forever.

334
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,290
Do you know?

335
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,690
Gao Yi has been in love with a girl

336
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,500
since many years ago.

337
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,820
Her name is Hai Lan.

338
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,820
She and Gao Yi

339
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,560
are the real childhood sweethearts.

340
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,580
During Gao Yi's most difficult time,

341
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,020
for him,

342
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,720
Hai Lan dropped out of school 
and came to work in the city.

343
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,310
They got together

344
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,250
at that time.

345
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,140
Actually, I don't know

346
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,570
when their relationship started.

347
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,970
At that time,

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,490
after I knew about their relationship,

349
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,920
I was deluded

350
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,030
and even thought

351
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,310
that I was the best choice for Gao Yi.

352
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,490
But delusions are delusions after all.

353
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,810
Hai Lan...

354
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,270
I saw them last month.

355
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,780
She was with Gao Yi.

356
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,200
Hai Lan...

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,780
Over the years,

358
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,430
Gao Yi's heart has never once wavered.

359
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,800
So, you and I

360
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,330
have never attained

361
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,050
the significance we wanted

362
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,310
in Gao Yi's heart.

363
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:39,910
So,

364
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
you already knew.

365
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,200
Now I feel like

366
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,670
I've been a joke

367
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,600
all these years.

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,980

369

Yang Jian loves you.

370
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,540
He has loved you for many years.

371
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,950
I believe you're well aware

372
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,990
of that too.

373
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,830
Yang is a good man.

374
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,050
I just want to say

375
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,680
that if you've really let go of Gao Yi,

376
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,220
then have a good life with Yang Jian.

377
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
I'll give you my best wishes.

378
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,960
Tell me.

379
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,670
What will Boss do in the future?

380
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,340
What do you mean?

381
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,940
The siblings became husband and wife

382
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,890
and the stepmother became his mother-in-law.

383
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,970
We are the most miserable ones.

384
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,670
From now on, do you think

385
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,710
we should call Zhaoyang

386
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,660
Sister-in-law?

387
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,040
You don't understand, do you?

388
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,910
That's right.

389
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,100
Just wipe the table in the room.

390
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,170
Mom is upstairs?

391
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,740
I'll go upstairs with you.

392
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,810
I'll talk to her alone.

393
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,130
There's no room for discussion.

394
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,330
Get a divorce right now!

395
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,900
Are you kidding me?

396
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,550
I can't believe

397
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,130
the daughter I've raised for over 20 years

398
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,800
would do this to me.

399
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,970
What are you thinking about

400
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,930
every day?

401
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,670
What am I thinking about?

402
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,380
I'm thinking about my daughter's wellbeing.

403
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,030
You're the problem.

404
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,240
Are you out of your mind?

405
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,320
I told you to be nicer and gentler

406
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,040
to Yang Jian

407
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,880
in hopes that he'll take good care of you,

408
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,960
and not that

409
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,790
you two would become a couple.

410
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,500
Now that you mention it,

411
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,980
you really do care for me.

412
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,250
Who else should I care for?

413
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,950
Do you think it was easy for me 
to raise you throughout the years?

414
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,150
After your dad passed away,

415
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,430
I've been investing in stocks and funds

416
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,310
to support you!

417
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,440
Do you really regard me

418
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,590
as your daughter?

419
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,400
Am I not just

420
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,670
another stock or fund

421
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,480
you invested in

422
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,260
that'll pay you the interest when it matures,

423
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,470
to repay you

424
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,650
for giving birth to me?

425
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,010
Yes.

426
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,080
I admit

427
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,440
that after you started making money,

428
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,000
I did ask too much from you.

429
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,760
But as the saying goes,

430
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,980
raise your children well so that 
they'll take care of you in old age.

431
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,210
Doesn't that apply here?

432
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,550
Besides,

433
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,690
it was not easy for me throughout the years.

434
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,180
When people bullied us

435
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,930
for being a single mother and a child without a father,

436
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,910
I gave my all to protect you.

437
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,350
Have you forgotten everything?

438
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
Now, I just hope

439
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,480
that you can get married

440
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,320
to someone better and rich.

441
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,540
Is that wrong?

442
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,610
Marry a better man?

443
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,480
Yes.

444
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,560
In the end, the person I married

445
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,110
is not a rich man.

446
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,350
He's not the person you want.

447
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,110
That's really why you're against it.

448
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,470
You...

449
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,270
You really underestimate me.

450
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,880
Although

451
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,970
I don't have much money now,

452
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,620
I'm savvy enough due to my life experiences.

453
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,980
Do you think I'm against this

454
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,580
because Yang Jian

455
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,620
is uneducated and runs an individual business

456
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,760
with just a small shop?

457
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,780
Have you forgotten

458
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,310
how Yang Jian's father

459
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,180
was like when he got drunk?

460
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,490
I'm worried that in 20 years,

461
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,610
Yang Jian will be like him.

462
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,080
What will you do then?

463
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,580
That's why I'm against it.

464
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,210
Do you get it?

465
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,990
Sweetie.

466
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,230
Listen to me.

467
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,960
Okay?

468
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,290
You're so stubborn.

469
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm really sad.

470
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,410
Let's talk about what'll happen in 20 years

471
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,040
when the time comes.

472
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,570
Who knows? In 20 years,

473
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,300
I might become

474
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,660
like you now.

475
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,430
Then I'd be a good match with him if he turns out...

476
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,300
like his dad.

477
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,400
Zhaoyang.

478
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,630
I'm fine.

479
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,140
Do you regret it?

480
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,480
What about you?

481
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,880
Do you regret it?

482
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,750
Our relationship

483
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,290
will always be up to you.

484
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,920
I will do my best in everything

485
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,130
and wait until you accept me.

486
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,370
You haven't eaten, have you?

487
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,170
I'll make you a bowl of wontons.

488
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,210
Hello, Miss.

489
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,930
What are you looking for?

490
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,380
I want to pick a gift.

491
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,750
Is it for a friend or...

492
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,030
A wedding gift.

493
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,580
♫Twinkle, twinkle, little star♫

494
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,790
♫How I wonder what you are♫

495
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,390
♫Up above the world so high♫

496
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,880
♫Like a diamond in the sky♫

497
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,200
♫Twinkle, twinkle, little star♫

498
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,310
Okay.

499
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,730
That's all for today.

500
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,080
Hurry up

501
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,220
and go back to your wards.

502
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,030
Or your parents will be worried.

503
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,160
Okay.

504
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,460
Bye, Sister Hai Lan.

505
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,870
-Bye.
-Bye, Sister Hai Lan.

506
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,670
Jiang Hu?

507
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,850
Come in and have a seat.

508
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
You know me?

509
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,690
You've grown taller

510
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,240
and prettier.

511
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,850
I've seen you

512
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,910
when you were little.

513
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,860
Come in.

514
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,890
Have a seat.

515
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,170
I didn't expect that we already

516
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,150
knew about each other's existence back then.

517
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,060
I'm glad you came to see me.

518
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,430
I just didn't expect

519
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,360
that our first official meeting

520
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,540
would be under such circumstances...

521
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,180
and that I'd be in such a state.

522
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,180
I don't know what to say either.

523
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,570
I'm just here to give you a wedding gift.

524
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,490
I'll put

525
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,360
the flowers here.

526
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,660
The sunflower is my favorite flower.

527
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,720
Every day,

528
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,320
it blooms

529
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,820
towards the sun.

530
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,500
It exudes a sense of vitality

531
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,690
and energy.

532
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,980
Thank you, Jiang Hu.

533
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,310
About the matter

534
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,450
of Gao Yi and your family,

535
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,860
I know everything.

536
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,170
You hate Gao Yi, don’t you?

537
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,990
Maybe it’s inappropriate for me to say this.

538
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,400
You've experienced

539
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,510
such a big change,

540
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,750
so you won't necessarily be persuaded.

541
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,670
But I still want to beg you.

542
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,470
Don’t blame Gao Yi.

543
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,390
This is between

544
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,280
me and Gao Yi.

545
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,410
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

546
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,960
I know.

547
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,660
But there's a side of Gao Yi

548
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,740
that you don't know.

549
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,960
He's actually very kind.

550
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,600
I have terminal breast cancer.

551
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,490
But he still

552
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,150
insisted on holding a wedding for me

553
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,800
so that I could have a complete life.

554
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,360
I'm just here

555
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,480
to give you a wedding gift.

556
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,590
After all,

557
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,870
I was acquainted with Gao Yi.

558
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,000
But I really don’t want to know

559
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,820
any more

560
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,780
about him.

561
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,980
Gao Yi is actually really pitiful.

562
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,110
His father went to jail

563
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,160
when he was very young.

564
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,420
Soon after, his mother passed away.

565
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,570
I should leave now.

566
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,460
His father is sick now

567
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,120
and I'm like this too.

568
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,100
He has never felt

569
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,150
the warmth of a family.

570
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,720
Didn’t Gao Yi’s father

571
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,340
pass away a long time ago?

572
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,980
Ms. Hai.

573
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,980
It's time to go to the doctor

574
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,790
for your check-up.

575
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,950
Jiang Hu.

576
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Trust me.

577
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,690
Gao Yi has his reasons

578
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,710
and his grudges.

579
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,590
Dad.

580
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,080
This weekend,

581
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,890
I'm getting married

582
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,830
with Hai Lan.

583
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,760
She lived in

584
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,930
the same neighborhood as us.

585
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,830
When I was young,

586
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,590
she often came to our house.

587
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,460
She has been with me all these years.

588
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,220
Do you remember?

589
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,490
Mar...

590
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,410
riage...

591
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,730
Marriage?

592
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,370
Good.

593
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,350
There'll be someone to take care of you.

594
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,730
Someone to take care of you.

595
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,220
Don't worry.

596
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,090
His father is sick now

597
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,640
and I'm like this too.

598
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,170
He has never felt

599
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,220
the warmth of a family.

600
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,660
What's wrong?

601
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,580
Nothing.

602
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
Here are all

603
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,600
the financial statements for this year.

604
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,239
Take a look.

605
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,610
If there's nothing wrong,

606
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,290
within a few days,

607
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,389
I'll personally head to Baoxing

608
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,389
to report to them.

609
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,770
Ms. Yue.

610
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,290
Thank you for your hard work during this period.

611
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,670
You're the one who suffered the most.

612
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,219
Teng Yue

613
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,570
has achieved the most splendid annual report

614
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,000
in 30 years thanks to you.

615
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,000
We should celebrate.

616
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,449
What's wrong?

617
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,159
It's something to be happy about.

618
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,670
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

619
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,290
Can I help you?

620
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,570
Do you know

621
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,030
the procedure of my dad's adoption of Gao Yi

622
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,470
back then?

623
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,770
His secretary handled it.

624
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,060
It's been many years since that person resigned

625
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,200
and they've settled down abroad.

626
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,470
Back then,

627
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,310
had Gao Yi’s parents

628
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,970
both passed away?

629
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,870
Why do you suddenly ask?

630
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,450
I remember

631
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,780
my dad told me

632
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,350
that when he adopted Gao Yi,

633
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,930
both his parents had passed away.

634
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,320
It happened so long ago.

635
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,670
And I think you should let go of

636
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,520
the matters about Gao Yi.

637
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,630
Well,

638
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,530
I'm just confused.

639
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,040
Because I heard

640
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,200
that Gao Yi’s father

641
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,360
is not dead.

642
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,820
You think it's strange too, right?

643
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,210
But back then,

644
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,180
why did Dad tell me

645
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,570
that his father is dead?

646
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,060
Ms. Yue.

647
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,530
Can you check it for me?

648
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,780
You really want to know?

649
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,220
Okay.

650
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,900
If it's important to you,

651
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,890
I can ask around for you.

652
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,010
Thank you, Ms. Yue.

653
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,670
Boss, what's wrong?

654
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,910
You've been ignoring me lately

655
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,820
whenever I talk to you.

656
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,070
Why aren't you active?

657
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,470
You don't like to play with me anymore?

It has a poor appetite recently.

659
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,470
It hasn't been eating much.

660
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,370
I have to make time

661
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,310
to take it to the hospital.

662
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,690
It's getting old.

663
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,950
It should get regular check-ups.

664
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,990
Why are you looking for me?

665
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,710
Let's take a walk.

666
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,810
I'm leaving.

667
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,660
Let's go.

00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,270
Are you okay?

669
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm fine.

670
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,890
I remember the first time

671
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,260
you came here to collect debts.

672
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,000
Teng Yue was

673
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,340
in ruins like the other

675
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,390
At that time, I already knew

676

that you'd definitely succeed.

Thank you.

679

It's not exaggerated

680
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,560
to say that

681
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,980
we have a life-and-death friendship, right?

682
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,730
Yes.

Do you also think

686
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,390
I'm not good enough for her?

687
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,250
You're a good catch for everyone.

Xiang Zhaoyang is blessed

689
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,500
to have you.

690

You're a woman after all.

You're good at comforting people.

692

Unlike me, I'll be frank with you.

Xu Si doesn't deserve you.

694

If he hears this,

695
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,150
he'll go crazy.

696
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,000
That fellow

00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,590
is always so arrogant.

698
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,950

everyone else.

700
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,550
He's just a little arrogant,

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,850
which makes people misunderstand.

that Teng Yue is

the thread of fate between you and Zhaoyang.

Back then, I was worried

763
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,980
Simon wouldn't bear to give up this land.

764
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:08,890
It was only until

765
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,980
I saw Guanglei interacting with him

766
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,760
was I totally convinced.

767
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,420
Simon draws a clear line

768
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,400
between business

769
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,280
and personal matters.

770
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,640
He wouldn't let personal matters

771
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,620
sway his judgement.

772
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,920
I admire him for that.

773
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,860
Everyone,

774
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,980
have you finished your discussions?

775
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,240
You're dismissed.

776
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,480
Simon.

777
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,860
Are you free tonight?

778
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:44,820
Ms. Yue.

779
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,940
I'm really sorry.

780
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,720
I've been too busy

781
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,740
these days.

782
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,490
You even had to personally come here

783
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,480
to report to us.

784
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,840
I should be the one going to Teng Yue

785
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,800
to have the meeting with you.

786
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,200
It's the same

787
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,620
whether you go to Teng Yue or I come to Baoxing.

788
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:56,930
Right now,

789
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,280
the year is going to end.

790
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,320
About financial matters,

791
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,270
we should meet and communicate

792
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,130
in time.

793
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:01,710
Yes.

794
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,460
Mr. Mei.

795
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,110
Are you working with

796
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,980
Jingyang Capital?

797
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,650
Yes.

798
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,350
Both companies have their own strengths.

799
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,330
So, we often work together

800
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,570
for some projects.

801
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,680
That's true.

802
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,640
Jingyang Capital's M&A team

803
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,390
is very famous.

804
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,300
They're best at helping clients

805
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,670
find the most suitable

806
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,060
small and medium-sized enterprises

807
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,750
in their industry chain

808
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,870
and complete the mergers and acquisitions

809
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,860
before the early stages of incubation.

810
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,080
They've done many listed companies'

811
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,580
mergers and acquisitions in the past few years.

812
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,730
Can I

813
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,710
meet Mr. Xu now?

814
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,470
Of course.

815
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,320
Ms. Yue, please.

816
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,930
Right now, the outbound and inbound

817
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,740
delivery quantities

818
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,280
are very accurate.

819
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,870
Hang on.

820
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,390
Hello?

821
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,590
Come to my house on Saturday.

822
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,980
Saturday?

823
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,350
I'm unavailable on Saturday.

824
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,110
I have to take Boss to the vet.

825
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,540
It's not doing well lately.

826
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,690
Then I'll go to your place on Sunday.

827
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,920
I'm unavailable on Sunday either.

828
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,300
I have something to do on Sunday.

829
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,040
What is it?

830
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,310
Nothing.

831
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,910
I'll look for you when it's done.

832
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,040
Bye.

833
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,620
Come in.

834
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,000
Mr. Xu.

835
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,320
Ms. Yue is here.

836
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:23,730
Mr. Xu.

837
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,030
Can we talk?

838
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,250
Yes.

839
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,670
Have a seat.

840
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Do you want something to drink?

841
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,000
It's fine.

842
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,170
I just drank something. Thank you.

843
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,750
I heard

844
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,590
that the current biggest client

845
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,850
of Jingyang Capital's Mei Shaowang

846
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,050
is Aneda.

847
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,460
Their M&A team

848
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,280
is looking for some small local shoe brands

849
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,890
in the market for Aneda.

850
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,960
Is that true?

851
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,080
Yes.

852
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,760
Jiang Hu is still inexperienced in the market.

853
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,820
She might not have realized

854
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,490
what implications the mergers and acquisitions

855
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,830
in the market entail.

856
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,200
Have you reminded her about that?

857
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,550
Not yet.

858
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,130
Then, pardon me for being bold,

859
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,840
but what project is the cooperation

860
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,630
of Jingyang and Baoxing based on?

861
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,800
Aneda.
