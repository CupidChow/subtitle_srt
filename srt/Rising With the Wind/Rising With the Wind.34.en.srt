00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,350
Look, the porridge is hot.

193
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,120
Let's have breakfast.

194
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,120
Shengjian buns are good.

195
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
Come on.

196
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
Have one. Hurry.

197
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,910
Mom, you guys eat.

198
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,780
I'm going down.

199
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,350
Sit down.

200
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,320
Look at you two.

201
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,510
What's going on?

202
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,710
I

203
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,470
finally convinced myself

204
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,470
to accept your relationship slowly.

205
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,710
You two are the ones who wants to get married.

206
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,480
But in just two days

207
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,470
it's also you two

208
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,310
who are fighting.

209
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,900
What's going on?

210
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm full.

211
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,830
Can't you

212
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,860
communicate with each other properly?

213
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,180
Mom,

214
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,230
I want to communicate with her too.

215
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,830
But I found that

216
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,230
I don't seem to know her that well.

217
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,520
Not just you.

218
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,930
To be honest,

219
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,960
I don't know my daughter either.

220
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,190
She

221
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,460
is cold to everything

222
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,810
except for drawing.

223
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,560
Tell me.

224
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,470
Of course, I understand.

225
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,350
I am part of the reason.

226
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,070
When she was young,

227
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,470
she suffered a lot

228
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,230
and was wronged.

229
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,830
But...

230
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,830
But Yang Jian,

231
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,410
you're a boy.

232
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,610
Let her have it.

233
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,470
Okay.

234
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,340
Mom, eat up.

235
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,110
Simon.

236
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,870
As for Aneda's acquisition of Teng Yue,

237
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,710
if you find it

238
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,840
inconvenient,

239
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,770
I've discussed it with Mr. Du,

240
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,870
I can help.

241
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,590
Of course, the project is still counted as yours.

242
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,710
It's not inconvenient for me.

243
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,430
The news has been spreading

244
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,410
on the Internet.

245
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,190
Now everyone

246
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,070
thinks the investors of Baoxing

247
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,510
have huge conflicts with the founders.

248
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,750
It’s been

249
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,980
48 hours.

250
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,990
It's not an entertainment industry news.

251
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,830
Those who are gossiping

252
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,840
can't remember it for so long.

253
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,990
That's what the viewers

254
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,830
think.

255
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,710
You and Jiang Hu

256
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,120
are not just simply

257
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,830
investor and founder.

258
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,690
Your emotions

259
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,470
will affect

260
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,750
the normal progress of the project.

261
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,630
For Teng Yue,

262
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,630
I do need some time

263
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,710
to solve the current problem.

264
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,800
I will give Mr. Du an explanation

265
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,869
when necessary.

266
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,190
President Xu doesn't look like

267
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,550
he's in a good state.

268
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,880
Who would be in a good state

269
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,740
if they're met with such a crazy woman?

270
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,270
It really opened my eyes.

271
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,710
In the past,

272
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,890
I thought Jiang Hu

273
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,450
might be a little wilful.

274
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,030
I didn't expect

275
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,190
she has such a hot temper.

276
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,310
She scolded investors in the open.

277
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,400
I hope Mr. Xu can deal with

278
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,760
the conflict between him and Jiang Hu as soon as possible.

279
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,630
It's not suitable for Jiang Hu

280
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,750
to continue staying as a part of Baoxing Group anymore.

281
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,780
Otherwise,

282
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,430
she'll only cause more trouble.

283
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,190
Although the outside world doesn't know

284
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,990
the personal relationship between Jiang Hu and Mr. Xu,

285
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,200
this is something we can't avoid.

286
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,950
I have no right nor

287
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,790
no interest to interfere

288
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,430
with Xu Si's private life.

289
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,070
But if it affects

290
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,950
Baoxing’s project,

291
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,230
then it's not

292
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,550
his personal matter anymore.

293
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,470
We can't just let a good project like this

294
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,430
go to waste.

295
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,950
Help me contact Jiang Hu.

296
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,930
I want to meet her in private.

297
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,650
Even Mr. Xu can't find Jiang Hu.

298
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,520
That's because

299
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,710
it's Xu Si looking for her.

300
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,400
Jiang Hu must still be in contact with

301
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,510
other people in private.

302
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,420
Okay, I'll try my best.

304
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,190
Are you sure you want to push

305
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,750
Mr. Mei and Ms. Tang's meeting to next week?

306

307
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,140
Yes.

308
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,330
I'll contact them myself.

309
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,150
Alright.

310
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,960
I still can't get through

311
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,590
to Jiang Hu's phone.

312
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,510
Jiang Hu

313
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,620
has been missing for so long.

314
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,710
We've already asked around

315
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,310
and looked for the people

316
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,370
we should have.

317
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,850
No one knows where she is.

If Jiang Hu still

320
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,480
doesn't show up,

Hello.

327
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,590
By the way,

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,710
if anything

329
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,120
happens,

Don't worry.

334
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,790
It's quite good.

335
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,910
Also,

336
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,390
it's getting cold.

337
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,670

By the way, Designer Xiang,

341
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,430
there's one more thing.

342
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,680
What is it?

343
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,580
Mr. Gao's wife passed away.

344
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,080
Should we hold a

345
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,010
memorial service?

346
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,380
When did it happen?

00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,480
Today.

349
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,550
can you help me take a look

350
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,990
and see if this index is normal?

351
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,090
It looks a little high.

352
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,280
But it's okay.

353
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,430

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,320
trying to fight her way through a mall.

385
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,320
T-that's not good.

386
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,230
Right?

387
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,290
Now, you can rest in the shade under a big tree.

388
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,230
You will be able to relax

389
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,960
and I'll be able to relax too.

390
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,630
Aren't these days kinda nice?

391
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,580
Right?

392
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,440
D-don't think too much.

393
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,850
Come back quickly.

394
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,650
If you don't come back,

395
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,640
I'm so worried that

396
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,790
m-my face is swollen.

397
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,090
Come back.

398
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,780
Be good.

399
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,240
Jiang Hu.

400
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,610
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,290
I thought

402
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,760
you would be like your father.

403
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,990
Your father saw profits

404
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,990
above all in business.

405
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,390
Aneda can indeed

406
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,080
help Teng Yue take a leap in quality.

407
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,800
I saw you being too tired

408
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,000
and stressed out

409
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,120
and I thought this would

410
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,640
help relieve your burden.

411
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,190
But I failed to consider

412
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,540
the amount of effort you've put

413
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,610
into Teng Yue.

414
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,800
You've put in so much personal feelings.

415
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,430
I'm very sorry

416
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,570
for my decision.

417
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,080
Also,

418
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,870
I've found something out about

419
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,420
what you asked me to inquire about.

420
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,630
I sent an address of a

421
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,750
retirement home to your phone.

422
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,220
Your dad used to ask me

423
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,190
to transfer a sum of money to

424
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,410
this place every year.

425
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,470
I thought it was

426
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,870
one of his charity projects.

427
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,910
But now it seems

428
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,240
the answer you're looking for

429
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,250
should be there.

430
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,580
This is the room you're looking for.

431
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,480
You finally came to see me.

432
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,900
You're not mad at me anymore?

433
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,260
I'll listen to you.

434
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,710
No matter what you say,

435
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,070
I'll listen to you.

436
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,620
Come in.

437
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,250
You kneeled in front of me

438
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,110
and begged me

439
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,420
to

440
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,920
take all the blame myself.

441
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,390
So that you can

442
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,120
help me with things outside

443
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,610
and take care of my family.

444
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,790
But

445
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,540
why did that

446
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,960
person who got jailed say

447
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,000
that you were afraid of being interrogated

448
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,730
and secretly

449
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,490
reported me first.

450
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,370
Jiang Hu.

451
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm the only one

452
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,950
who doesn't know about Uncle Gao, right?

453
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,720
Actually, many things

454
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,220
have nothing to do with you.

455
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,780
Now I finally understand

456
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,750
why you'd

457
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,710
look at my dad

458
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,190
and go into a trance.

459
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,860
The way you looked at me

460
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,710
was also full of conflicting emotions and distance.

461
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,390
Back then,

462
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,550
we were both too young.

463
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,910
There are many things we can't hide

464
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,160
nor figure out.

465
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,230
What about Peace Loan?

466
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,550
Actually,

467
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,510
I just wanted to teach Free Unicorn

468
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,870
a lesson with Peace Loan.

469
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,890
But I didn't expect

470
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,960
things to go out of control.

471
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,540
After Shen Gui disappeared,

472
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,230
I asked my friends in Hong Kong

473
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,150
to look for him.

474
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,390
But before

475
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,710
I could find him,

476
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,680
Shen Gui’s disappearance

477
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,110
was exposed by the media.

478
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,790
I always thought

479
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,130
you told the media

480
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,630
that Shen Gui went missing.

481
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,000
Actually, I already started to

482
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,000
regret at that time.

483
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,620
I just didn't expect

484
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,710
things would turn out like that.

485
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,170
Jiang Hu,

486
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,310
I did some things

487
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,710
that made you sad.

488
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,870
Which also directly led to

489
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,120
the many problems you faced afterwards.

490
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,300
I'm really sorry.

491
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,230
I once imagined about

492
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,230
you apologizing to me

493
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,150
or pleading guilty,

494
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,870
but now,

495
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,250
I don't have the right to

496
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,310
blame anyone

497
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,070
nor judge those

498
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,390
entangled grudges.

499
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,390
I can only say

500
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,070
we are all

501
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,470
paying for our mistakes

502
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,910
in different ways.

503
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,430
I'm still paying the debt

504
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,230
for what my dad did.

505
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,140
Jiang Hu.

506
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,570
You must remember.

507
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,230
Don't think of other's faults

508
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,710
to be yours.

509
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,890
I already know

510
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,660
what happened to Teng Yue.

511
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,810
You've been working very hard

512
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:28,930
in the past year.

513
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,320
It's really hard for one

514
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,420
to do this alone.

515
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,050
Since you persisted,

516
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,790
then don't give up.

517
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,750
Isn't life like this?

518
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,340
Every obstacle comes with another obstacle.

519
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,580
Once it passes, it's passed.

520
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,460
This is...

521
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,910
Hai Lan's funeral

522
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,920
was on Sunday.

523
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,350
She left in peace.

524
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,770
My condolences.

525
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,070
Don't worry.

526
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,350
What are your

527
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,450
next plans?

528
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
I plan to go on a long holiday

529
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,330
starting from tomorrow.

530
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,230
Yang Jian.

531
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,500
Xu Si is here.

532
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,140
Have a good chat with him.

533
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,030
Who's there?

534
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,720
Who?

535
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,980
Yang?

536
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,179
Didn't I tell you

537
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,449
not to deliver food?

538
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,469
It's troublesome.

539
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,780
You have to cut and cook them.

540
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,100
It's easy.

541
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,010
Have you eaten today?

542
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,469
No.

543
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,150
I don't want to eat.

544
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,870
My tooth aches.

545
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,540
Your tooth aches?

546
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,850
Why do you always have a toothache?

547
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,429
You need to see a doctor.

548
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,590
Let me take you to the hospital.

549
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,190
What doctor?

550
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,989
It's so troublesome.

551
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:38,830
I bought medicine.

552
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,980
I even brought you some wine today.

553
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,130
Don't drink if you have a toothache.

554
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,389
Have some porridge.

555
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,469
Here.

556
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,070
What porridge?

557
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,150
Plain porridge. What else can it be?

558
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,620
Here.

559
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,790
Thank you.

560
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,540
You're welcome.

561
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,110
Can you eat the vegetables?

562
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,070
No.

563
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,870
Have some.

564
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,950
I haven't eaten either.

565
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,790
I'll eat with you.

566
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,830
There's beef.

567
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,230
Here, have some vegetables

568
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,460
You and Zhaoyang haven't made up yet?

569
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,160
You two can't

570
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,390
go on like this.

571
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,190
You don't have to care about that.

572
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,910
After this,

573
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,990
I found that

574
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,510
I'm the one who's been trying to

575
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,040
force it onto her.

576
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,760
People who don't

577
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,910
walk on the same path,

578
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
can never

579
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,990
walk together.

580
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,720
Yes.

581
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,480
People who don't

582
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,750
walk on the same path,

583
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,300
can never walk together.

584
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,370
Xu Si came to see me today.

585
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,870
He's looking for you.

586
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,350
Aren't you going to talk to him?

587
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,190
About what?

588
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,260
He would have talked to me a long time ago if he could.

589
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,910
I gave him a chance.

590
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,750
But what greeted me was

591
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,100
lies and deceit.

592
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,550
Even at the very end,

593
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,140
he didn't mention a single word to me.

594
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,680
I can't accept it.

595
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,070
I can't.

596
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,750
the so-called best arrangement

597
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,990
he has for me.

598
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,560
I understand what you said.

599
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,020
What about in the future?

600
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,270
What are you going to do?

601
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,620
Just keep hiding here

602
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,400
and not going out?

603
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,950
I don't know.

604
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,500
Anyway,

605
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,700
I don't want to face anything now.

606
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,790
I don't know how to face it either.

607
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,800
You can't do this.

608
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,460
This is nothing.

609
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,160
Who's that again?

610
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,200
Cloud Footwear's Ye.

611
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,930
Do you remember him?

612
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,840
We wanted to

613
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,920
get his patent previously.

614
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,510
Why?

615
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,660
That's him.

616
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,890
I heard that

617
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,880
Aneda

618
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,250
has always wanted to acquire them.

619
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,740
Ye

620
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,980
rejected Aneda 28 times.

621
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,310
Look at him.

622
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,150
He's over 60 years old.

623
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,950
This persistence is worth learning from.

624
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,910
28 times?

625
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,730
Ye

626
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,800
has the same thought as you.

627
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,070
He just wants to make

628
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,110
a small and long-lasting brand.

629
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,550
But he is too old

630
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,100
and can't keep up with the market.

631
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,200
Look at him. He's so old

632
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,840
but still working hard.

633
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,680
What do you lack as compared to him?

634
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,880
You're so young.

635
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,600
Who are you?

636
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,880
You are Jiang Hu.

637
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,030
Where's your courage?

638
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,660
You have to get up strong.

639
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,660
I support you.

640
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,990
That's enough. I don't need to tell you these.

641
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,070
You know it yourself.

642
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,110
I'd better try

643
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,240
the beef I made for you.

644
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,420
Toothache.

645
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,520
You're unlucky that you don't get to eat my beef.

646
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,470
It's fine if you don't mention it.

647
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,660
But now that you mentioned it, it hurts again.

648
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,380
How about drinking some then?

649
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,230
I want to.

650
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:19,000
[Hamburger set
Without ice]

651
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,710
Factory director.

652
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,370
You should meet him in person.

653
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,550
Zhang,

654
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,310
I told you.

655
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,480
For the salesmen we're hiring

656
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,440
I will leave it to you.

657
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,660
Just follow

658
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,600
Li's standard.

659
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,060
This Li,

660
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,950
as soon as the factory's new patent got approved

661
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,620
and was in urgent need of a salesperson,

662
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,130
he asked to retire

663
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,520
and refused to return the job.

664
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,560
Just thinking about it makes me frustrated.

665
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,720
They're not here for the job.

666
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,080
Uncle Ye.

667
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,240
What are you doing here?

668
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,080
Mr. Ye.

669
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,890
Teng Yue and Cloud Footwear

670
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,030
are both old brands.

671
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,380
For some things,

672
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,950
we can learn to communicate.

673
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,990
I think

674
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,030
you're trying to get something out of me.

675
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,590
Mr. Ye,

676
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,540
can you tell me

677
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,750
why do you always have this attitude

678
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,960
every time you see me?

679
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,950
Did I offend you?

680
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,580
Your dad

681
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,900
never mentioned about Cloud Footwear to you?

682
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,640
It makes sense.

683
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,550
He wouldn't have mentioned it.

684
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,180
Neither do I want to talk about it.

685
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,580
How about this?

686
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,480
Just go back.

687
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,520
Teng Yue and Cloud Footwear

688
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,630
will not...

689
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,250
No, I mean,

690
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,600
will never,

691
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,010
get the chance to communicate and learn from each other.

692
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:20,980
That's right.

693
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,590
Your

694
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,690
ambiguous reason

695
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,910
makes me feel like you are the problem.

696
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,120
Why is it my problem?

697
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,820
Do you really want to know

698
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,800
the real reason?

699
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,320
Okay.

700
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,000
It looks familiar, doesn't it?

701
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,430
Thirty years ago,

702
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,360
your dad was right here.

703
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,600
Right where you're standing.

704
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,000
I explained to him in detail

705
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,100
how to make

706
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,050
an anti-slip rubber sole.

707
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,640
How to use nitrile rubber

708
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,860
and natural rubber

709
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,090
to be mixed into styrene-butadiene rubber,

710
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,800
bromobutyl rubber,

711
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,990
and other chemical materials

712
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,100
according to the proportion to make it.

713
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,810
My dad used to work at Cloud Footwear?

714
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,270
He really didn't tell you?

715
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,300
When your dad returned, he cut the queue

716
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,500
and his first job

717
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,790
was Cloud Footwear's sales assistant.
