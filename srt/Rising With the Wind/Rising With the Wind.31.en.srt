6
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,539
I don't like

7
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,050
too much salt and soy sauce

8
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,230
in my food.

9
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,690
I know.

10
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,410
I only eat the wrappers of steamed stuffed buns.

11
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,080
I love hot milk.

12
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,990
I know.

13
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,460
Besides painting,

14
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,150
I have no other hobbies.

15
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,579
You've been like this since you were a child.

16
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,510
Aneda

17
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,070
was the big company I dreamed of going to

18
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,070
in college.

19
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,400
I hoped my Chinese-style design

20
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,620
could be recognized by them.

21
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,460
Alright.

22
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,480
The wontons are ready.

23
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,300
Come out and eat.

24
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:44,750
Eat.

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,350
Just now,

26
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,200
I told you what I like.

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,270
Now

28
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,770
let me tell you what I don't like.

29
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,200
I don't like wontons.

30
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,530
My mom's second husband

31
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,990
also sold wontons.

32
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,290
When I was six,

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,370
this man

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,600
took me to his wonton shop to wash dishes.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,230
Then, one day,

36
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,450
my mom owed a lot of money

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,920
due to her stock investments.

38
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,550
To avoid

39
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,770
paying the debt for my mom,

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,770
he divorced her.

41
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,520
He even drove

42
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,600
me and my mom

43
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,400
to a very,

44
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,430
very shabby hostel.

45
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,950
We lived there for more than half a year

46
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,020
until

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,500
we met your dad.

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,650
My mom told her secret wonton recipe

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,710
to your dad, who ran a boxed meal restaurant.

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,600
Then they got married.

51
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,780
I...

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,350
I didn't know it.

53
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,600
Mom said you liked wontons.

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,290
I thought...

55
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,590
I admit the wontons made by your dad

56
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,140
are really delicious.

57
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,190
But I really don't like it anymore.

58
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,600
You weren't yourself during the meeting today.

59
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,330
You're being a know-it-all again.

60
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,390
And you're not yourself right now.

61
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,140
I've studied you.

62
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,710
If you drink wine

63
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,180
instead of milk tea,

64
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,360
you must have encountered a trickier problem.

65
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,390
I didn't expect

66
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,150
you'd work so hard

67
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,060
to study me.

68
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,820
We investors

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,700
are good at reading people.

70
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,670
I heard

71
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,750
you are dating

72
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,970
Jiang Hu from Teng Yue.

73
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,220
Is it true?

74
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,030
Yes.

75
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,400
Congratulations.

76
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,370
You're going to enjoy a double celebration.

77
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,820
What's there to worry about?

78
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,909
I haven't told Jiang Hu

79
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,340
that we plan to sell Teng Yue

80
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,260
to Aneda.

81
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,470
You didn't mention it, did you?

82
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,020
This is your fault.

83
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
It's such a big deal.

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,040
You need to communicate.

85
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,590
What if you two expect

86
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,650
different prices?

87
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,330
You'd better

88
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,020
talk to her about it

89
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,410
so that it won't affect your relationship.

90
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,830
I know.

91
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,490
It's not that I don't want to tell her.

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,280
The thing is, I don't know

93
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,570
how to tell her.

94
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,090
For Jiang Hu, Teng Yue

95
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,200
should be priceless.

96
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,600
What do you mean?

97
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,030
Will she

98
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,700
refuse to sell it?

99
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,300
What if she really refuses?

100
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,670
It won't be that serious.

101
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,610
As long as

102
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,550
you offer enough money,

103
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,320
I think everything is negotiable.

104
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,910
Besides,

105
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,590
this is obviously

106
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,350
a win-win situation.

107
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,670
Entering Aneda's channel

108
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,640
will also be a good thing for Teng Yue.

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,030
Even if Jiang Hu refuses,

110
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,550
Baoxing

111
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,030
holds a 51% stake in Teng Yue

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,050
and thus has absolute control over it.

113
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,010
In the end,

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,280
you have the final say.

115
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
That's what I'm most worried about.

116
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,580
You don't know her.

117
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,760
Neither did I.

118
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,110
You underestimate her.

119
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,159
So did I.

120
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,670
Are you going to

121
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,590
live like this?

122
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,390
What do you mean?

123
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,750
You two

124
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,540
got married for no reason.

125
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,320
You didn't hold a wedding.

126
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,790
You don't live in the same room.

127
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,480
What kind of marriage is this?

128
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,930
Not only you,

129
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,050
even I

130
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,500
still can't believe it.

131
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,710
About this,

132
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,830
Ms. Zhou is very angry.

133
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,030
Never before has she

134
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,590
been scowling at Zhaoyang and you

135
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,990
for such a long time, right?

136
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
No mother

137
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,310
can accept this.

138
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,720
Well,

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,760
aren't you

140
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,600
making trouble for yourself?

141
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,240
It's not trouble.

142
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,130
I'm by her side with a new identity.

143
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,370
It's good.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,840
Since you were a child,

145
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,940
your love for Zhaoyang

146
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,800
has never changed.

147
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,030
What should you do?

148
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,970
Why don't you tell her?

149
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,980
Zhaoyang.

150
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,010
Xiang Zhaoyang.

151
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,310
Xiang Zhaoyang.

152
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,010
Zhaoyang.

153
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,310
Zhaoyang.

154
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,140
Zhaoyang. Wake up.

155
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,630
You're safe now.

156
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,650
To be frank,

157
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,820
she likes Gao Yi

158
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,870
just because

159
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,230
she thinks Gao Yi saved her

160
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,590
from drowning.

161
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,340
Tell her

162
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,700
it was you who saved her.

163
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,410
That'll be more effective than

164
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,270
making 100 bowls of wontons for her.

165
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,340
At dinner today,

166
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,270
Zhaoyang talked a lot with me.

167
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
She has started

168
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,910
to accept me.

169
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,090
I'm quite satisfied.

170
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,900
You

171
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,620
get everything done quickly.

172
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,380
But when it comes to your feelings for Zhaoyang...

173
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,890
[Rongyi Pets]

174
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,200
Head down.

175
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,680
He lost his appetite lately?

176
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,630
Recently,

177
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,710
he hasn't been eating much

178
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,590
or drinking much water.

179
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,560
He only had one meal yesterday.

180
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,220
And he lost interest in chicken breast.

181
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,710
He no longer comes to you

182
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,460
and plays with you, right?

183
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,540
Is his hair loss serious?

184
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,650
A little.

185
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,000
His wart is very serious.

186
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,600
What happened to him?

187
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,990
He's already 13 years old.

188
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,210
As a large dog,

189
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,660
he's already very old.

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,600
As his owner,

191
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,710
you should be mentally prepared.

192
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,050
Boss.

193
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:29,800
Boss.

194
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,630
What?

195
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,940
You also want to play?

196
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,770
For all the time you've been with me,

197
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,440
I've seldom

198
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,630
taken you out to play.

199
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,450
I was neglectful.

200
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,390
I should have taken you out more often,

201
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,050
right?

202
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,770
When you first came to my home,

203
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,280
I was in high school.

204
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,030
Dad picked you

205
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,060
from the circus.

206
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,340
He wanted to keep you at home.

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,130
But,

208
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,110
you

209
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,420
were nice only to him.

210
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,530
You always barked at me when you saw me.

211
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,960
Free Unicorn couldn't keep a dog.

212
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,130
Dad could only leave you

213
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,400
in Teng Yue.

214
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,240
If you had been nicer to me

215
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,730
at that time,

216
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,880
we could have spent more years together.

217
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,260
You want to play,

218
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,670
right?

219
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,030
Do you want to play?

220
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,460
Boss.

221
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,060
Do you want to play?

222
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,350
I'll cook a good meal for you tonight, okay?

223
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,960
Iberian pork.

224
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,950
Do you want it?

225
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,010
How come you're so handsome?

226
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,370
Whose dog are you?

227
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:15,990
Whose dog are you?

228
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,460
Whose?

229
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,980
Everything will be fine.

230
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,350
You can start.

231
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,270
[Mr. Gao Yi, Ms. Hai Lan]

232
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,750
Why are you standing here?

233
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,170
I didn't receive an invitation.

234
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,700
Then why did you come here?

235
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,770
To say goodbye to the past.

236
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,710
It's funny

237
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,880
that we were actually

238
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,070
jealous of each other.

239
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,530
No matter what happened

240
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,450
between you and Gao Yi,

241
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,550
it won't change

242
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,200
how I feel about Gao Yi.

243
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,370
We can't

244
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,740
always stay in the past.

245
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,710
We have to accept

246
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,990
changes in many things.

247
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,470
Yes.

248
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,680
Our youth

249
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,830
is over.

250
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,890
We should cherish the people around us.

251
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,550
Yang is good.

252
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,480
So is Mr. Xu.

253
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,089
They came out.

254
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,290
The bride and groom came out.

255
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,920
Since you don't want to go there,

256
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,819
go back to Teng Yue early.

257
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,890
I'm going to

258
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,650
congratulate them.

259
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,990
♫You say the wind picks up♫

260
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,950
♫I close my eyes♫

♫I smell regret and nostalgia♫

265
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,280

♫Innocent promises♫

♫I know it has all ended♫

♫Like a fulcrum♫

♫Then in a determined, romantic, and quiet way♫

You're late.

What?

286
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,510
♫When I realize this is love♫

287
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,120
Are you also this busy on the weekend?

288
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,550
I've finished my business.

289
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,600
♫You're already gone♫

290
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,600
Now I can spend time with my boss.

291
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,430
Then take a walk

292
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,230
with me.

293
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,190
Your hand is freezing.

294
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,940
Warm it for me.

295
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,250
Sir. Miss.

296
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,970
We have

297
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,500
a garden villa in Ruijin Hotel.

298
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,030
It's a good place

299
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,710
for a romantic outdoor wedding.

300
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,460
And you can stay in a free wedding room

301
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,370
for two nights.

302
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,070
Thank you.

303
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,150
We are not interested

304
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,490
in having a wedding in a villa.

305
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,350
We want to have it in a hotel.

306
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,760
I can also recommend hotels

307
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,970
suitable for holding a wedding.

308
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,870
My girlfriend

309
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,130
hasn't agreed to marry me.

310
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,740
I don't want you to waste your time.

311
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,760
Then hurry up and propose.

312
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,470
Your relationship

313
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,710
seems solid.

314
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,630
Do you

315
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,620
really think so?

316
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,750
Yes.

317
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
All you need is a wedding.

318
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,030
Okay, thank you.

319
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,570
After I propose to her,

320
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,160
I'll let you take care of our wedding.

321
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,020
Thank you.

322
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,540
Bye.

323
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,290
Bye.

324
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,140
About your proposal,

325
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,260
was it a joke or...

326
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,870
You know clearly

327
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,760
if I was joking.

328
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,130
You know better yourself

329
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,400
what you're thinking.

330
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,020
Everyone knows.

331
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,100
You know, and I know.

332
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,300
Eat.

333
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,040
You really love this restaurant.

334
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,470
You're so boring.

335
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,270
Didn't I tell you

336
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,150
my family used to run a cup factory

337
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,150
when I was a kid?

338
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,990
The factory

339
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,990
was right across the street.

340
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,310
Really?

341
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,200
When I was young,

342
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,170
my dad used to come here

343
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,620
to buy me milk tea.

344
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,230
So it's the taste from your childhood.

345
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,370
I'm curious.

346
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,070
Your parents opened a factory.

347
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,430
But why did you

348
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,910
choose the finance industry?

349
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,960
Just because you can earn lots of money quickly?

350
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,310
Bingo.

351
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,470
Don't interrupt.

352
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,430
Answer my question.

353
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,790
I've been looking for an answer.

354
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,260
What is it?

355
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,040
The relationship between finance and enterprises.

356
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,290
How can I understand enterprises better?

357
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,650
How can I

358
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,960
offer more help to them?

359
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,130
How can I be more valuable?

360
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,190
Are you a philosopher?

361
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,560
Right.

362
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,100
It's a waste of time talking about such philosophical topics

363
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
on the weekend.

364
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,230
Let's get to the point.

365
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,920
We

366
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,290
should discuss

367
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,390
our dating schedule.

368
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,550
You changed the topic

369
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,800
too fast.

370
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,230
Dating schedule?

371
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,540
Do we need a schedule for that?

372
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,810
You think we have an assembly line?

373
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,340
From now on, you should spend every weekend

374
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,090
with me.

375
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,630
Why?

376
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,790
Why?

377
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,740
I have the final say.

378
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,490
You are being unreasonable.

379
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,350
Here's the milk tea.

380
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,610
Girl,

381
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,270
I think

382
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,730
you should rip him off.

383
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,270
Set a budget for him

384
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,610
and then let him make the schedule.

385
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,660
You can't spoil

386
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,280
your boyfriend.

387
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,920
You must

388
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,090
stick to your position

389
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,340
and not be easily trapped.

390
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,810
Lu, you're right.

391
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,960
Lu,

392
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,740
which one of us is your regular customer?

393
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,760
I'm also a woman.

394
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,400
Of course

395
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,700
I'm on her side.

396
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,590
Enjoy your meal.

397
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,800
Did you hear that?

398
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,310
Let me take a sip.

399
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,190
Your birthday is coming, right?

400
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,980
I'm going to give you a gift.

401
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,890
That's what you should do.

402
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,250
You have to give me a gift as well.

403
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,030
It's my birthday,

404
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,950
and I have to give you a gift?

405
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,630
A gift in return.

406
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,800
Why...

407
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,540
The gift

408
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,810
doesn't have to be expensive.

409
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,280
But you can't buy me clothes again.

410
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,700
The gift must be unique.

411
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,440
You're really unforgiving.

412
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,710
And you have many requests.

413
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,770
It's simple.

414
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,860
Just cook me a meal.

415
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,640
You want me to cook?

416
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,380
Are you sure?

417
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,120
Yes.

418
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:11,930
Come to my place

419
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,270
on weekends to practice.

420
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,810
Are you sure

421
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,290
you'll eat whatever I cook?

422
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,070
Yes.

423
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,430
Okay.

424
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,160
I dare to cook if you dare to eat.

425
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,630
I dare.

426
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,790
Okay.

427
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,630
[Baoxing Investment]

428
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,370
Which one do you like?

429
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,310
I...

430
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,470
Are you looking for me?

431
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,810
Have you found the person

432
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,270
who bought Jiang Hu's car?

433
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:55,940
Yes.

434
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,160
Very interesting.

435
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,060
They were enemies.

436
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,290
Do you think these rich girls

437
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,540
have nothing better to do?

438
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,610
Let me go over it for you.

439
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,630
She wears the shoes Jiang Hu wore

440
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,950
and drives the car Jiang Hu drove.

441
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,670
Think about it.

442
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,110
Will she

443
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,260
date

444
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,620
Jiang Hu's ex?

445
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,500
Enjoy your date.

446
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,830
Single man.

447
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,980
Tomorrow,

448
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,090
I'll check your progress.

449
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,950
I didn't

450
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,540
miss any steps.

451
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,680
It

452
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,380
may not look good,

453
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,580
but it should taste good.

454
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,130
You can't judge food by how it looks.

455
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,710
Right?

456
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,470
You're right.

457
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,620
How about this?

458
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,910
I'll get some for you.

459
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,740
Have a taste.

460
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,250
Let me get you some.

461
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,830
Let me get you a prawn.

462
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,740
You cooked it. Don't be so polite.

463
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,600
Try it.

464
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,100
Uncle Xu.

465
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,270
Fei is here.

466
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,070
Sister Jiang Hu.

467
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,810
Why are you here?

468
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,670
My dad and mom are both

469
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,880
on a business trip tonight.

470
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,010
So I came here to sleep over.

471
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,440
Tonight?

472
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,200
My dad said you agreed.

473
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,710
When did I agree?

474
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,430
He sent you a WeChat message,

475
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,660
and you said, "Okay."

476
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,100
Did I?

477
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,630
Sister Jiang Hu.

478
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,530
I'm here for a meal again.

479
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,630
This is for adults.

480
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,410
Kids can't eat it.

481
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,070
Weren't you so confident just now?

482
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,090
Show Fei.

483
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,390
He is hungry.

484
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:55,990
Hurry up.

485
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,120
Show me.

486
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,870
Show him.

487
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,500
Let him smell it

488
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,440
and taste it.

489
00:25:59,450 --> 00:25:59,950
Hurry up.

490
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,320
Right.

491
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,080
Fei.

492
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,420
Uncle Xu

493
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,650
specially cooked it for you.

494
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,240
Look.

495
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,850
How is it?

496
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,640
It's okay, Fei.

497
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,870
Uncle Xu didn't cook well.

498
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,500
It doesn't matter.

499
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,610
I have a way.

500
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,850
Is this

501
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,110
your so-called solution?

502
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,930
Or what?

503
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,460
How about

504
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,230
you eat

505
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,350
the terrible dish I cooked?

506
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,110
Yang Jian really

507
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,720
does everything you say

508
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,710
and comes whenever you call.

509
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,110
Done.

510
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,040
It smells so good.

511
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:58,990
Come on.

512
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,550
Let's eat.

513
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,270
Let's have some orange juice.

514
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,110
Sure.

515
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,790
Fei.

516
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,720
I didn't know you were here.

517
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,270
If I knew,

518
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,430
I would have brought more groceries.

519
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,530
There're already many dishes.

520
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,600
Thank you, Brother Yang.

521
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,310
You're welcome.

522
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,620
Mr. Xu.

523
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,160
I'm surprised.

524
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,980
I didn't expect

525
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,390
you and Mo Bei to be good friends.

526
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,430
We grew up

527
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,350
together.

528
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,400
It's nothing surprising.

529
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,040
Have a seat, Yang.

530
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,190
Here, Fei.

531
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:28,790
Alright.

532
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,260
Jiang Hu is my sister.

533
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,160
Mo Bei helped me.

534
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,580
For

535
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,770
these reasons,

536
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,210
let's be friends from now on.

537
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,800
Sure.

538
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,290
Thank you for today.

539
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,110
-You're welcome.
-Cheers.

540
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,150
Here.

541
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,440
Brother.

542
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,780
Sister.

543
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:48,860
Uncle.

544
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,410
Cheers!

545
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,190
Cheers!

546
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,290
Cheers!

547
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,720
Cheers.

548
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,720
No way.

549
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,840
Are you still angry?

550
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,510
I know you're trying hard

551
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,280
to fix

552
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,780
my relationship with Yang Jian.

553
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,960
I knew

554
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,550
you were smart

555
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,590
and understanding.

556
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,880
But

557
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,440
don't take up

558
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,740
our time for dating.

559
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,030
So petty.

560
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm not only petty but also good at getting what I'm supposed to get.

561
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,550
I know

562
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,000
it may be impossible

563
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,110
to eat your cooking.

564
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,720
Think about

565
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,440
what gift to give me.

566
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,940
It feels like you're collecting a debt.

567
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,190
I won't deny that.

568
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,350
You do owe me money.

569
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,340
Got it.

570
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,640
Bye.

571
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,730
One last step.

572
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,140
Are you satisfied?

573
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,990
Thank you, boss.

574
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,520
I'm not sure

575
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,830
if we have this fabric.

576
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,770
Ms. Jiang.

577
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Are you sure

578
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,220
you want to make a pair of old-style shoes?

579
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,880
And

580
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,210
I want to

581
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,710
sew some patterns onto the shoes myself.

582
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,600
You want to do it yourself?

583
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,320
Okay.

584
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,830
I'll look for it.

585
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,360
Okay.

586
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,720
Thank you, Master Zhang.

587
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,420
You're welcome.

588
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,850
Mr. Xu has been coming here a lot recently.

589
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,200
I remember

590
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,560
the shoelace

591
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,630
on Xiang's drawing

592
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,390
is about 7 mm wide.

593
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,750
This one is 5 mm wide.

594
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,780
And I think the eyelets

595
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,130
are a bit small.

596
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,440
If we make the shoelace wider

597
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,070
and

598
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,000
pull it like this,

599
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,640
it may be a little tight.

600
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,880
The shoes

601
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,440
may be hard

602
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,680
to put on.

603
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,770
Remember this.

604
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,550
Hello?

605
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,440
Are you busy today?

606
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,700
Let's have dinner together tonight.

607
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,850
It's not the weekend.

608
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,980
Who said you only have to stay with me

609
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,810
on weekends?

610
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,230
You said it last time.

611
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,870
It doesn't count.

612
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,970
How can you say that?

613
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,740
Are you a rascal?

614
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,500
Your coat looks very nice today.

615
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,740
I like the color.

616
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,070
My coat?

617
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,570
Surprise!

618
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,790
Stop it.

619
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,840
Stop what?

620
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,830
I'm not doing anything.

621
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,080
When did you learn this?

622
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,440
I'm sincerely

623
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,190
inviting you

624
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,300
to dinner tonight.

625
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,780
I'm warning you.

626
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,410
Stop it.

627
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,730
Everyone is watching.

628
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,750
Ms. Jiang,

629
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,680
I've made up my mind

630
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,830
to have a serious relationship

631
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,620
with you.

632
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,180
Please

633
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
show your sincerity.

634
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,670
Okay?

635
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,370
Fine.

636
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,390
I'm coming down.

637
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,600
What do you think?

638
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,670
Are you

639
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,580
competing with Yang Jian?

640
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,570
Why would I?

641
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,630
I'm an amateur,

642
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,890
but he's a pro.

643
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,680
Am I that stupid to challenge him?

644
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,710
I just want to find out

645
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,870
how hard it is

646
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,760
to learn to cook a dish.

647
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,850
So,

648
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,580
this is the dish

649
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,080
you've been practicing cooking for a week?

650
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,580
You're going to be the first

651
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,370
to taste

652
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,180
a dish cooked by me.

653
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,760
Of course, besides my mom

654
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,790
and aunt.

655
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,590
They were really brave.

656
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,210
But

657
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,720
I have

658
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,810
accident insurance.

659
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,840
I'm not afraid.

660
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,050
You're not afraid?

661
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,590
I'll add more salt.

662
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,060
Are you afraid?

663
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,290
I'll add some scallions.

664
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,310
Try it.

665
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,950
You're making it sound like you're not going to eat it.

666
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,150
Try it.

667
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,350
You try it.

668
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,750
Beat it.

669
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,730
Okay.

670
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,010
Let me show you.

671
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,040
It's foamy.

672
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,620
This won't do.

673
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,070
I remember...

674
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,630
It's right to make it foamy.

675
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,390
The video

676
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,510
says so.

677
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:35,870
Look.

678
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,600
Let me ask you something.

679
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,440
It's a serious question.

680
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,179
The brand of your speaker

681
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,699
is the same as that of Mr. Du's speaker?

682
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,020
Answer me seriously.

683
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,699
What do you want me to say?

684
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,469
Did you

685
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,480
fix my speaker

686
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,770
yourself?

687
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,670
You're very satisfied

688
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,460
with your boyfriend's DIY skills?

689
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,670
At that time,

690
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,160
would you be that kind to me?

691
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,940
What do you think?

692
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,850
Your wine tastes good.

693
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,010
Really?

694
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,780
Is it good?

695
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,010
Do you want another sip?

similar to the one they used before

767
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,890

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,220
For whom

774
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,070
are you trying so hard

775
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,940
to make this pair of customized shoes?

776
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,100
A friend.

777
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,720
Boyfriend?

778
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,540
Xu Si.

779
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,270
You put a lot of effort into him.

780
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,570
Don't look at me like that.

781
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,160
The other one.

782
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,060
What?

783
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,100
Stop looking at me.

784
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,360
And the shoe box.

785
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:12,870
Here.

786
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,890
It's been a long time

787
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,750
since I last saw you put your work away

788
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,850
and date a girl

789
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,990
seriously.

790
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,380
I thought

791
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,310
you would devote your whole life

792
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,930
to your career.

793
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,300
That's because

794
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,480
it wasn't the right time,

795
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,480
and I didn't meet the right person.

796
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,370
I heard

797
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
Teng Yue is doing well now.

798
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,740
Their online and offline stores are all out of stock.

799
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,270
They're looking for an OEM.

800
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,410
What do you plan to do next?

801
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,300
That's not

802
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,160
my business.

803
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,480
Jiang Hu is charge of Teng Yue.

804
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,580
Don't give me that.

805
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,510
You bought

806
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,630
a brand on the verge of bankruptcy

807
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,030
and changed it

808
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,410
into a market hit.

809
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,300
Don't tell me a factory

810
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,490
and tens of millions in sales

811
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,320
are enough for you.

812
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,110
Tell me.

813
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,640
What company wants to buy it?

814
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,680
Aneda.

815
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,330
I knew it.

816
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,610
What does

817
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,360
Jiang Hu think about it?

818
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,560
I haven't found

819
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,830
the right opportunity to tell her.

820
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,670
You're just waiting for the right opportunity?

821
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,420
I understand very well

822
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,460
the feelings

823
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,750
of industrialists like Jiang Hu.

824
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,850
She saw her factory

825
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,920
grow

826
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,550
with her own effort.

827
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,620
It's like a mother giving birth to her child

828
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,120
after a 10-month pregnancy.

829
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,120
How much money do you think

830
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,350
is enough to make it up to her?

831
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,070
You still haven't told

832
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,470
Jiang Hu about this.

833
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,740
Are you afraid

834
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,540
this will break her heart?

835
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,440
Do you have to do this?

836
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,220
Let me ask you.

837
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,190
Do you want your son

838
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,060
to become

839
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,170
a person

840
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,390
who mixes business with personal life?

841
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,220
You can keep them separate.

842
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,180
Do you think

843
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,040
Jiang Hu

844
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,320
can do the same thing?

845
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,160
Don't worry.

846
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,680
Everything I do

847
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,810
is for her good.

848
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,510
Everything you do is for her good?

849
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,940
This is what you think.

850
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,250
Maybe she

851
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,290
doesn't need it at all.

852
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,900
In a sense,

853
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,990
you may even hurt

854
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,970
her feelings.
