00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,590

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,140
that one day, I'd work in Teng Yue Factory

111
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,420
and design shoes

112
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,240
for Teng Yue.

113
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,630
This 100-year-old shoe design

114
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,290
is still very chic and edgy.

115
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,390
For example,

116
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,590
its toe box

117
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,550
gives enough space

118
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,210
for our toes.

119
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,890
In the new release I designed,

120
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,150
I kept the strengths of the old design.

121
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,140
In the meantime,

122
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,440
I made some improvements.

123
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,409
For example,

124
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,970
a small change here to the structure

125
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,860
of the shoe

126
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,310
can make our feet

127
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,370
look narrower.

128
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:56,780
I can't just sit here.

129
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,930
I need to prepare some food for Zhaoyang.

130
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,280
She's working so late

131
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,860

delicious food tonight.

134
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,010
Therefore,

135
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,830
using better materials

136
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,740
is more scientific

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
and can make the shoes more comfortable.

138
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,400
I think

139
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,820
it may

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,630
change the stereotype

141

144
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,100

148
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,440
As for how to overcome this challenge,

149
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,190

150
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,190

151
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,700
The problem is still unsolved.

After I return to the company next week,

162
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,870
I'll meet them one by one.

163
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:40,700
Okay.

164
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,760
Let me tell you, Boss.

165
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,830
I was right when I said

166
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,710
Yang Jian was rude,

167
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,230
wasn't I?

168
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,590
How could he hit you?

169
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,250
He has no idea

170
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,310
that looking dapper

171
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,350
is a must

172
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,270
in this industry.

173
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,560
We need to look dapper

174
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,390
when we meet our clients.

175
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,960
Otherwise,

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,110
they'll think we're unprofessional,

177
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,710
right?

178
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,430
Enough.

179
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,110
You've been meeting founders

180
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,990
for me these days.

181
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,800
You must be tired of it.

182
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,830
No.

183
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,520
Not at all.

184
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,410
I swear.

185
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,350
It's a great job.

186
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,880
I mean it.

187
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,020
By the way, Mr. Xu,

188
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
someone insisted on talking with you

189
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,240
about the details of the project.

190
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,710
Who's it?

191
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,590
The founder of Smart Shoe Manufacturing Production Line R&D.

192
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,190
His name is Zhou Qing.

193
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,130
He used to be a technician.

194
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,250
Shoe manufacturing?

195
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,110
Okay.

196
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,850

Okay.

198
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,310
Wait.

199
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,420
Boss.

200
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,690
Why have you

201
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,600
taken a special interest

202
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,600
in this shoe manufacturer?

203
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,620
I have to remind you

204
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,470
that this is not right.

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,990
All right.

206
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,940
That's all for the meeting.

207
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,470
I'm hanging up.

208
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,500
He hung up.

209
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,380
Fine.

210
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,340
I just checked the data.

211
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,110
Around forty to fifty thousand people

212
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,610
watched Xiang Zhaoyang's livestream.

213
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,470
Does that mean

214
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,070
in the future, forty to fifty thousand people

215
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,040
will buy the shoes she designs?

216
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,230
That's not how we calculate the conversion rate

217
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,210
for influencer marketing.

218
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,230
If that were the case,

219
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,120
it'd be great.

220
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,020
Yeah.

221
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,510
Look.

222
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,070
So many people like her

223
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,830
and watched her livestream.

224
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,480
She should hurry up

225
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,990
and finish designing those new shoes

226
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,760
as soon as possible.

227
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,890
It's been a week

228
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,750
yet there's no progress at all.

229
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,010
What's she doing?

230
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,910
We should trust the girls, shouldn't we?

231
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
Have some faith in them.

232
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,110
I do trust them.

233
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,640
But we can't afford to wait.

234
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,880
We can.

235
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,400
Teng Yue

236
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,010
was the first brand in China

237
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,010
that tried to interpret fashion.

238
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,110
What I need to do now

239
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,540
is make the original shoes

240
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,780
more comfortable

241
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,350
and durable,

242
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,060
and perfect the old design.

243
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,440
But these days,

244
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,710
I'm having trouble designing.

245
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,830
I'm not feeling inspired.

246
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,040
I tried all kinds of ways

247
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,230
and did a lot of research,

248
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,170
but all the designs I came up with

249
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,180
were not satisfactory.

250
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,990
Have I

251
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,620
run into a dead end

252
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,750
of designing?

253
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,160
Can I not design something

254
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,370
better than

255
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,530
Flowing Scenery?

256
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,470
Since you're not inspired now,

257
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,320
go out and work out with me.

258
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,480
Let's go.

259
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,100
I'm livestreaming.

260
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,380
Whether you're here or not,

261
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,870
it's the same on camera.

262
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,110
I think I've seen

263
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,090
the truth.

264
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,210
What is

265
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,260
this livestream all about?

266
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,390
Hurry.

267
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,020
Leave a comment.

268
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,810
You'll not be working out for nothing.

269
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,510
Although the disagreement between us

270
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,120
can't be settled,

271
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,110
I don't want

272
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,520
to pressure you as your boss.

273
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,860
Let's have a race then.

274
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,140
Whoever wins has the final say.

275
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,770
Childish.

276
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,410
Aren't you childish?

277
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,740
Do you know another way

278
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,630
to solve our problem

279
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,150
immediately?

280
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,310
Bring it on.

281
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's race.

282
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,090
I won't lose anyway.

283
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,030
I've never lost before.

284
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,090
Let's run around Teng Yue Factory.

285
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,900
Whoever runs back here first

286
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,870
wins.

287
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,030
Let's start.

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,710
Ready?

289
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,750
Go.

290
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,990
♫Fly, even though it's dangerous ahead♫

291
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,480

Look.

300
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,400
Her shoe fell off.

301
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,990
♫I just spread my wings♫

302
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,970

334

You're always sitting in your chair

335
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,940
and drawing.

336
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,350
I didn't expect you to run so fast.

337
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,780
I didn't expect it

338
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,350
to be a draw.

339
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,830
What should we do now?

340
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,470
How about this?

341
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,110
Based on my marketing idea

342
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,320
and your design idea,

343
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,430
you'll design two collections of shoes.

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,830
One will be priced under 200 yuan

345
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,190
and the other at 599 yuan.

346
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,680
We'll let the sales numbers

347
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,790
be the judge.

348
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,250
This is the fairest way

349
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,700
for you, me,

350
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,240
and the hundreds of Teng Yue's workers

351
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,710
who are waiting to be paid.

352
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,990
Xiang Zhaoyang.

353
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,270
There's no

354
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,400
turning back for me.

355
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,099
As you know,

356
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,790
Aneda has got the upper hand

357
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,550
and Zhang Wenshan

358
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,310
has stopped using Teng Yue

359
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,470
as his OEM.

360
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,880
Teng Yue is hanging by a thread now.

361
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,850
Whether it can survive

362
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,290
and thrive

363
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,300
depends on this.

364
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,110
Don't let me bear your burden.

365
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,810
It's your burden too.

366
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,710
Neither you nor me

367
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,200
can turn back now.

368
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,670
We have to soldier on.

369
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,930
Trust is the foundation of everything.

370
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,210
You trust me,

371
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,720
so you're willing

372
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,710
to devote your precious time as a designer

373
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,630
to Teng Yue.

374
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,380
I trust you as well.

375
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm sure that you can

376
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,870
give Teng Yue a future.

377
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,640
Only by trusting each other

378
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,550
can we make things better.

379
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,270
Am I right?

380
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,420
Where are you going?

381
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm going to work.

382
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,710
Do you expect

383
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,190
the designs of those two collections

384
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,650
to fall out of the sky?

385
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,950
Then I'll send

386
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,710
the market research I've done recently

387
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,360
to you.

388
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,640
You can refer to it.

389
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,610
Also,

390
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,930
the fabric I required

391
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,080
in the last meeting,

392
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,880
get it for me as soon as possible.

393
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,750
Let's continue.

394
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,630
I'm back.

395
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,910
Thank you

396
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,350
for supporting me all this time.

397
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,550
Now,

398
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,820
I'll continue to design.

399
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,230
Zhaoyang is back?

400
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:32,930
Yes.

401
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,070
Really? Is it really her?

402
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,070
You can make it, Lord Zhaoyang.

403
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,380
Now, I need to pick a main color

404
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,750
that is the most suitable

405
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,510
for Teng Yue's new releases.

406
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,200
How about the color called Twilight Mist?

407
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,680
That's purple, right?

408
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,150
But I prefer to call it

409
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,000
by the name

410
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,960
the ancient people gave it.

411
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,330
The wild flowers are cloaked in mist at twilight.

412
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,150
The light in the room is fading at dusk.

413
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,920
The term Twilight Mist

414
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,870
conveys a natural,

415
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,880
delicate,

416
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,560
and graceful impression.

417
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,550
But…

418
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,270
Yeah.

419
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,840
This is the latest.

420
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,680
So beautiful.

421
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,710
So beautiful.

422
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,390
Look.

423
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,070
Ms. Jiang

424
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,570
bought this especially for you.

425
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,190
Dog food for old dogs.

426
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,480
It's easy

427
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,930
to digest.

428
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,270
Here.

429
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,710
Enjoy.

430
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,030
I know you don't like hearing this,

431
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,590
but you have to admit

432
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,750
that you're an old dog now.

433
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,280
You need to be careful with what you eat.

434
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,120
Understand?

435
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,890
This is the best food for you.

436
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,830
Eat up.

437
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,550
Alright.

438
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,650
I'll put it another way.

439
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,920
This is not for puppies.

440
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,980
It's dog food for adult dogs.

441
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,190
It sounds better now, doesn't it?

442
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,360
After you eat it,

443
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,940
you'll be back in your day

444
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,540
and become charming.

445
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,250
You'll be a lady killer.

446
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,270
Okay?

447
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,720
Eat up.

448
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,570
Hurry.

449
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,210
Eat up.

450
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,350
Eat up.

451
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,140
It's boring to eat alone.

452
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,390
I'll eat with you.

453
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,990
It's not done yet.

454
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,020
You seem to be enjoying it very much.

455
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,080
You can have it all.

456
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,320
It's done.

457
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,380
Master Zhang.

458
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,500
My friend came to visit me

459
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
with some local specialties.

460
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,660
I've brought some for you.

461
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,030
Put it there.

462
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,750
What's wrong?

463
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,520
Is the design of the new release

464
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,920
not good enough?

465
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,470
The design

466
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,900
is the best design

467
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,850
I've ever seen in the past few years.

468
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,880
I've said the same

469
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,780
to Ms. Xiang.

470
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,430
Then why do you look worried?

471
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,430
This fabric

472
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,510
is too expensive.

473
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,310
We can't afford it.

474
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,780
The fabric?

475
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,150
I heard

476
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,270
that Cloud Footwear

477
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,610
has a special

478
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,390
patent fabric

479
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,260
that's fireproof, puncture-resistant,

480
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,220
and cut-resistant.

481
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,820
Cloud Footwear will in no way help us out.

482
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,840
Understand?

483
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,750
Why?

484
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,190
The factory director of Cloud Footwear

485
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:45,690
is Ye Guoming.

486
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,440
You know that?

487
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,620
He's a grumpy old man.

488
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,040
The two factories

489
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,840
used to be rivals.

490
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,480
He seems to hold a grudge

491
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,710
against Ms. Jiang's father.

492
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,310
That's why.

493
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,290
Really?

494
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,800
I heard that Ms. Jiang

495
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,320
wants to meet Ye Guoming

496
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,010
for a talk.

497
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,940
I bet it's about the fabric.

498
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,840
[Cloud Footwear]

499
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,730
[Non-Smoking Meeting Room]

500
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,270
The number of workers

501
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,230
in each production line

502
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,770
has been reduced from fifty to just around a dozen,

503
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,630
resulting in a 50% increase

504
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,010
in production efficiency.

505
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,920
We've achieved an annual standard production capacity

506
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,810
of 300,000 pairs of shoes per production line

507
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,760
and an annual increase in output value of 10 million yuan.

508
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,570
Mr. Zhou.

509
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,560
Your R&D costs

510
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,690
have exceeded 50 million yuan.

511
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,830
The total investment in each production line

512
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,180
is over 12 million yuan.

513
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,600
Only an industrial park

514
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,390
with an annual output value of over one billion yuan

515
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,500
can afford it.

516
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,360
Moreover, the construction cost

517
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,510
is no less than 40 million yuan.

518
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,840
That's a lot of money.

519
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,350
Why didn't you reach out

520
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,780
to a large shoe company for cooperation?

521
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,420
My…

522
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,510
My team

523
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,950
hope the outcome of our work

524
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,640
can serve more than just one shoe company.

525
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,390
We don't want our patent

526
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,830
to be monopolized.

527
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:43,670
Have some tea.

528
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,630
Okay, thank you.

529
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,660
Hey, you.

530
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,880
Do you want to steal my patent too?

531
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,000
Mr. Ye.

532
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,290
Mr. Ye.

533
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,710
If I wanted

534
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,270
to steal your patent,

535
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,280
I wouldn't have

536
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,790
come to you again and again

537
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,460
and waited for you for hours every time.

538
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,670
Besides,

539
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,390
why did you

540
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,570
say "too"?

541
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,230
Has your patent

542
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,250
been stolen before?

543
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,680
I understand that you're guarded

544
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,300
because you were set up before.

545
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,630
But some people

546
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,470
still play by the rules

547
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,500
and have a line.

548
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,190
Moreover, these shoes are on display

549
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,430
and you've already patented them.

550
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,710
It's useless for me to steal your shoes,

551
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,230
isn't it?

552
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,010
I just asked you one question

553
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,500
yet you made a dozen of comebacks.

554
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,360
No wonder you're Jiang Qisheng's daughter.

555
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,010
Your father

556
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,280
was glib-tongued and eloquent

557
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,190
when he was young.

558
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,070
Mr. Ye.

559
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,160
Since you knew my father,

560
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,920
I should respect you as an elder.

561
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,820
It's fine that an elder has kept me waiting

562
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,080
for the whole morning.

563
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,870
Remember to make an appointment next time.

564
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,080
My job

565
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,510
is not to sit in the office

566
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,710
and wait to meet

567
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,020
uninvited guests.

568
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,530
I made an appointment.

569
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,600
I've made three appointments.

570
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,070
But you just wouldn't meet me.

571
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,680
So I had to

572
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,630
come to you directly.

573
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,230
Can't you take the hint?

574
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,730
I don't have time

575
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,890
and don't want to see you.

576
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,050
Mr. Ye.

577
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,690
We can make business happen if you're willing to talk.

578
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,990
You jumped to a conclusion

579
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,050
before we even started talking.

580
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,750
Don't you think

581
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,990
as the director of Cloud Footwear,

582
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,870
you're being very irresponsible?

583
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,420
It's exactly because

584
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,690
I'm a very responsible man

585
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,760
that I refuse to get involved

586
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,830
with Teng Yue.

587
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,950
Wait.

588
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,180
I don't understand.

589
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,390
Why are you so hostile

590
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,010
to me and Teng Yue?

591
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,360
Alright.

592
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,730
Let's call it a day.

593
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,460
It's already noon.

594
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,860
Have lunch at the canteen and go back.

595
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,380
Don't come here again.

596
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,460
I'm a cranky man.

597
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,290
I may lose my temper

598
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,550
if you come again.

599
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,380
Mr. Zhou.

600
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,680
Your project

601
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,590
doesn't meet

602
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,510
our investment standards and expectations.

603
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,470
Sorry.

604
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,140
We talked for a long time today.

605
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,840
Thank you.

606
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,280
I wasted your time.

607
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,030
Sorry.

608
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,580
Joey.

609
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,080
Walk Mr. Zhou out.

610
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,470
Okay.

611
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,910
-Goodbye.
-Mr. Zhou, this way.

612
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,120
Take care.

613
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,910
Xu Si.

614
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,140
Mr. Du.

615
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,910
Aren't you supposed to be recuperating at home?

616
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,800
I just talked with a founder.

617
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,270
I'm on vacation

618
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,680
and it was not a formal meeting,

619
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,390
so

620
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,940
I'm casually dressed.

621
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,110
Speaking of founders…

622
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,170
I need to have a word with you.

623
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,380
You should know

624
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,590
that Aneda has used

625
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,460
Xiang Zhaoyang's prize-winning design first

626
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,450
and Free Unicorn has stopped

627
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,790
outsourcing orders to Teng Yue.

628
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,100
If Teng Yue can't release

629
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,710
new products on time,

630
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,590
no one

631
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,740
will be able to help them out.

632
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,950
Releasing new products

633
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,400
is the KPI I set for Teng Yue

634
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,780
for this quarter.

635
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,390
They'll meet it.

636
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,750
This is not the first blunder Jiang Hu has made

637
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,730
since she took charge of Teng Yue.

638
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,390
Investors should allow

639
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,830
founders to make mistakes.

640
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,470
Mr. Du.

641
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,920
You said that

642
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,410
at the last industrial summit.

643
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,550
I understand your concerns.

644
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,370
Rest assured.

645
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,670
I have Plan B.

646
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,230
I'll make sure

647
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,490
that Teng Yue's new products

648
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,790
will be launched on time.

649
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,790
That's the best.

650
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,970
I have a plane to catch.

651
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,400
I hope when I come back,

652
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,600
you'll have good news for me.

653
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,120
Sure.

654
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,590
Goodbye, Mr. Du.

655
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,030
Hello, Xiangwan.

656
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,470
Fine.

657
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,760
I see.

658
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,380
I'll be right there.

659
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,660
Kiddo.

660
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,000
Have your parents left for the airport?

661
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,070
Why are you looking at me like that?

662
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,710
I heard from my mom

663
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,180
that you got hurt in a fight.

664
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,100
Don't worry.

665
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,900
Since you're a patient,

666
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,680
I'll take good care of you.

667
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,760
You take care of me?

668
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,370
Your parents

669
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,070
asked me to babysit you for a few days.

670
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,790
Understand?

671
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,730
Uncle Xu Si.

672
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,950
I've grown up.

673
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,810
Why are you

674
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,970
still so childish?

675
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,360
You brat.

676
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,300
Don't run.

677
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,090
-No.
-Come back.

678
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,080
Slow down.

679
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,910
Kiddo.

680
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,050
Go in.

681
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,810
Change your shoes.

682
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,470
Okay.

683
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
As usual,

684
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,090
you'll do your homework on the first floor

685
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,650
while I work on the second floor.

686
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,230
If you have

687
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,070
any questions,

688
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,790
come to ask me.

689
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,280
Forget it.

690
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,430
You're a smart kid.

691
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,230
I don't think

692
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,230
you'll have any questions.

693
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,960
Do you want yogurt?

694
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,190
Yes.

695
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,430
Uncle Xu.

696
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,990
You finally

697
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,570
improved a little bit.

698
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,800
What do you mean?

699
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,260
There's a plant in your house,

700
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,600
and it's alive.

701
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,270
You little brat.

702
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,870
Do you have to

703
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,230
be so straightforward?

704
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,580
By the way, Uncle Xu,

705
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,060
you got into a fight.

706
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,540
Didn't your mom tell you off?

707
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,520
My mom forbids me to fight.

708
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,380
But

709
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,830
I secretly had a fight with a senior

710
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,000
who bullied my classmates.

711
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,370
I won in the end.

712
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,540
You shouldn't be boasting about that in front of me.

713
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,780
Aren't you afraid

714
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,330
I'll tell your parents about it?

715
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,560
A real man doesn't snitch.

716
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,630
You won't tell on me,

717
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,370
will you?

718
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,890
I'm flattered.

719
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,840
I won't tell on you.

720
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,240
Your scar has almost healed.

721
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,750
This is a bruise,

722
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,520
not a scar.

723
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,710
It'll go away in a few days.

724
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,330
That's good.

725
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,950
Then you don't need to get plastic surgery.

726
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,660
Even if I had a scar,

727
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,640
I wouldn't have plastic surgery.

728
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,740
My dad said

729
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,070
men should look clean

730
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,670
and handsome

731
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,990
to make their wives happy.

732
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,080
First,

733
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,350
my appearance

734
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,190
won't get in the way of me finding a girlfriend.

735
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,620
Second,

736
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,000
when kids drink something,

737
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,060
they'd better stay quiet.

738
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:26,500
[Changle Restaurant]

739
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:30,909
Boss.

740
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,400
You're preparing food again?

741
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,679
Don't touch them.

742
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,320
They're for Zhaoyang.

743
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,179
Are your hands clean?

744
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,550
You can eat that.

745
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,280
Don't touch the rest.

746
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,920
Teng Yue

747
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:48,909
has got Chef Lin.

748
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,270
Is he better at cooking than me?

749
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:52,469
Yes.

750
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,440
Yes, sometimes.

751
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,550
You're both good at cooking.

752
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,840
Even if he's better at cooking than me,

753
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,760
he doesn't know what Zhaoyang likes

754
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,260
as I do.

755
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,730
For example, Zhaoyang prefers

756
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,090
scrambled eggs with tomatoes to be sweet

757
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,070
instead of salty.

758
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,450
She also prefers

759
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,250
the eggs to be in small pieces.

760
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:12,510
Forget it.

761
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,700
You won't understand.

762
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,550
You're making scrambled eggs with tomatoes

763
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,830
like it's the signature dish

764
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
of a Michelin-starred restaurant.

765
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,780
Go mind your own business.

766
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,350
Okay.

767
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,980
Don't rush me.

768
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,780
Someone rushed you?

769
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,890
My uncle?

770
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,130
He's an impatient person

771
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,730
and doesn't know anything about creating

772
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,880
and designing.

773
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,640
He thinks they're just doodling.

774
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,390
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

775
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,760
Good designs take time.

776
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,440
I can wait.

777
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,220
When is the livestream

778
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,120
of the product launch?

779
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,870
It's in 21 days,

780
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,180
14 hours, and 23 minutes.

781
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,640
But we have to leave 15 days

782
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,550
to make samples,

783
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,660
and three days to…

784
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,670
Drink the milk before it gets cold.

785
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,260
Then go home and have a good rest.

786
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,030
Take a hot bath.

787
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,170
Have a good sleep.

788
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,190
You need enough rest

789
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,380
to create more productively.

790
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,760
I'm leaving.

791
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,710
Are you there?

792
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,650
Have you had dinner?

793
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,100
I'm going on a business trip to Germany next Monday.

794
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Uncle Xu.

795
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm hungry.

796
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,390
Can we order takeout?

797
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,420
Sure.

798
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,490
What do you want to have?

799
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,110
I'll order it for you.

800
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,580
I want to have…

801
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,540
How about this?

802
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,910
You

803
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,770
are growing

804
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,360
and should have healthy home-made food.

805
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,020
When did you learn to cook?

806
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,260
Are you sure the food you make is edible?

807
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,670
Of course.

808
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,660
Have I ever lied to you?

809
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,860
How about I take you

810
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,370
to have a free meal?

811
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,810
Is it good?

812
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,960
It's great.

813
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,340
You can have braised pork,

814
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,900
fried chicken with wood ear mushrooms,

815
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,360
and smoked salmon.

816
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,870
That sounds great!

817
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,250
Let's go.

818
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,900
Get changed.

819
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,400
Okay.

820
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,260
Hello.

821
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:44,900
Are you in the factory?

822
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,040
Good.

823
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,940
I've arrived at the factory.

824
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,430
Come down.

825
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,890
What?

826
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,120
Here we are.

827
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,500
Let's go.

828
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,110
Puppy!

829
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,990
That's not a puppy.

830
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,120
Don't you know

831
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,070
what a puppy is?

832
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,710
A big dog like that bites.

833
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,340
Can I pet it?

834
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,930
No.

835
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,520
Stand here.

836
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,050
Come back.

837
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
Puppy.

838
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:21,460
[Warning: This scene is for entertainment purposes. Do not imitate.]

839
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,370
It's so cute.

840
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,880
It doesn't bite.

841
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,630
You lied.

842
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
He's…

843
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,170
Hello, Miss.

844
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,400
That's my dad.

845
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,820
Dad?

846
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,950
I'm not your dad.

847
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,750
You wouldn't even

848
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,490
let me be your godfather.

849
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,070
Why did you

850
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,290
suddenly call me Dad today?

851
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,260
What do you mean?

852
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,970
I haven't finished my words.

853
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,680
That's my dad's friend.

854
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,250
You brat.

855
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,990
The kid is growing.

856
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,090
I can't let him eat takeout,

857
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,790
so I brought him here.

858
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,710
Kid,

859
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,000
what do you want to eat?

860
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,930
Thank you for asking.

861
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,380
Mom said I can't be picky about food.

862
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,080
It'll hurt the feelings of the person

863
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,430
who cooks for me.

864
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,080
Good boy.

865
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,370
Okay.

866
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,750
I'll decide for you.

867
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,190
Let's go, Mr. Xu.

868
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,800
Let's go eat.

869
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,120
What?

870
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,220
Take the dog

871
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,080
away.

872
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,020
Sorry.

873
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,070
I forgot. You're afraid of Boss.

874
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,820
Mr. Qin.

875
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:30,820
Come.

876
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,720
Take the dog away.

877
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:33,740
Get up.

878
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,420
Come, Boss.

879
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,720
Okay. Let's go.

880
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,420
Doggy.

881
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,780
Get up.

882
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,270
Let's go, Mr. Xu.

883
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:41,940
Let's go.

884
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,680
You're so sweet to her

885
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,280
but so mean to me.

886
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:49,980
Why is that?

887
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,910
Be nice to me.

888
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,100
I'll help you.

889
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,130
You're so cunning.

890
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,520
What do you mean?

891
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,070
You came to see this pretty girl

892
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,630
in my name.

893
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,100
I've seen you through.

894
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,630
What are you talking about?

895
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,490
You're just a kid.

896
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,290
You know nothing.

897
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,420
Listen.

898
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,470
When we eat later,

899
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,020
you should stay quiet,

900
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,290
or I'll sew your mouth shut.

901
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,120
Let's go.

902
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,410
Let's go.

903
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:20,890
Go.

904
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,460
I can see it.

905
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,910
See what?

906
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,160
You want her to be your girlfriend,

907
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:32,730
right?

908
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,430
Keep your mouth shut.

909
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:33,860
Am I right?

910
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,160
It's so delicious.

911
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,990
Thank you. You and Chef Lin

912
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,310
prepared so many delicious dishes

913
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,660
for me.

914
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,820
I'm going to recommend this place

915
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,750
to my parents,

916
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,560
grandparents,

917
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,030
Ms. Li Hua,

918
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,110
and Xu Ling.

919
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,490
Fei.

920
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,540
This place is not open to the public.

921
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,540
But

922
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,510
if you want to eat here,

923
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,110
come to me anytime, okay?

924
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:56,910
Okay.

925
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,730
You just mentioned Xu Ling and Li Hua.

926
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,890
His mother is Mo Xiangwan.

927
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,350
Lin Xiang's manager,

928
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,870
the owner of Qingyuan Culture, right?

929
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,740
You know my mom?

930
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,470
Your mom is so famous.

931
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,830
Of course I know her.

932
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,470
Then it's a deal.

933
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,290
Whenever you miss

934
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,600
the food here,

935
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,470
even if your Uncle Xu is busy with work,

936
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,760
you can call me directly.

937
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,310
Okay?

938
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:25,850
Okay.

939
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:26,800
Then,

940
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,110
let's become friends on WeChat.

941
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:28,790
Sure.

942
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,670
Done.

943
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,970
I've scanned it.

944
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,490
Good for you.

945
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,750
You've even added her as a friend on WeChat.

946
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,900
I'll help you.

947
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,970
What are you whispering about?

948
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,250
It's a secret between two men.

949
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,140
You brat.

950
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,370
How come you've never

951
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,990
looked at me

952
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,270
so lovingly before?

953
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,060
How old are you?

954
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,410
He's just a little kid.

955
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,430
Eat up.

956
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,790
I'm going on a business trip next Monday.

957
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,340
That's all you got to say?

958
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,200
Good luck with everything.

959
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,600
That's perfunctory.

960
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,430
I wish you a safe journey

961
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,510
and good luck with everything.

962
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,360
I hope you can get

963
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,020
whatever you want

964
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,700
and be loved

965
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,960
by everyone you meet. Is this good enough?

966
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,040
What's wrong?

967
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,020
My stomach hurts.

968
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,810
Have some medicine later.

969
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,810
Do you want to drink something, Fei?

970
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,560
You…

971
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,020
No, thanks.

972
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,560
How can you be so cold-blooded?

973
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,830
I'm having a stomachache.

974
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,630
Can't you give me

975
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,470
a little bit more attention?

976
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,280
Uncle Xu Si,

977
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,310
why are you whining

978
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,600
like a kid to Jiang Hu?

979
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,510
Whining?

980
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,810
I'm not whining.

981
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,940
Keep eating.

982
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,220
You talk too much.

983
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,050
Did you just glare at me?

984
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,160
You glared at me.

985
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:16,990
You…

986
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,190
Stop doing this.

987
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,320
I'll take your beef.
