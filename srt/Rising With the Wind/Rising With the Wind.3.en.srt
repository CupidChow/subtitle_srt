00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,590
What did you do to my car?

7
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,440
What a piece of junk.

8
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,990
Piece of junk?

9
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,270
Don't borrow my car ever again.

10
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,550
Pay us back!

11
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,840
They've been protesting there for a few days.

12
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,670
We can't let this go on,

13
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,040
can we?

14
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,630
How about

15
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,829
you go talk to them?

16
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,160
Make an excuse

17
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,390
and send them away.

18
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,790
Pay us back!

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,730

21

What is she doing here?

22
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,260
She's…

23
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,440
You must keep in mind

24
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,820
the theme

25
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,440

of every design element.

27
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
Actually, your educational background is not good enough.

28
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,090
You just have a second-tier college degree in light industry.

29
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,270
You should've

30
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,710
washed out

31
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,620
in the first-round interview.

32
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,520
Ms. Tang

33
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,550
thought you had potential

34
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,710
and talent,

35
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,770
so she let you stay

36
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,890
despite others' objections.

37
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,490
If you have any chance of staying,

38
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,380
it'll be because of her.

39
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,610
These designs are pretty good.

40
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,270
But the details

41
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,730
need to be modified.

42
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,830
Look.

43

44
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,790
Adjust this.

45
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,300
Ms. Tang.

46
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,740
I wonder if I can…

47
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,090
I know what you want to say.

48
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,540
Go back and wait for my call.

49
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,550
Here.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
Make it higher.

51
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,740
And here.

52
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,490
The shoelaces.

53
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,470

55
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,390
Close the door.

Here.

57
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,750
Okay.

58
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,540
Free Unicorn went under.

59
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,180
Teng Yue went under with it.

60
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,680
They owe me 230,000 yuan

61
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,930
and owe Qian too.

62
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,990
We can't get our money back now.

63
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,270
We're just running small businesses.

64
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,120
With so many bad debts,

65
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,110
we can barely keep things afloat.

66

68
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,090
is nowhere to be found.

77
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,710
she can get around half a million yuan

78

79
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,430
Here.

80
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,210
Give it to me.

81
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,040
Give it to me.

84

If

85
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,370
you had been nicer to them,

86
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,500
this wouldn't have happened.

87
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,360
Why did you argue with them?

88
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,280
Look where it got you.

89
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:46,890
Look.

90
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,890
Look, look, look.

91
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,070
Look at me.

92

They

93
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,360
threw eggs at me

94

but I didn't fight with them.

95
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,159
Just ignore them.

96
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,420
It'll be over eventually.

97
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,170
We'll bounce back

98
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,920

99
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,480

In this situation,

Alright.

109

Stop arguing, okay?

110
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,280
After they leave,

111
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
you should go home.

No.

123
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,780
call me.

124
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,430
Got it.

125
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:17,880
Call me.

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,190
Ms. Jiang.

127
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,710
Are you getting used to using the back door?

128
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Are you here for money?

129
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Since you know,

130
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
let's get it over and done with.

131
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,540
Teng Yue bought raw materials

132
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,770
from my friends on credit.

133
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,140
They're worth

134
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,820
hundreds of thousands of yuan.

135
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,310
When will you pay them?

136
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,700
There are procedures we need to follow.

137
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,540
Internal and external.

138
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,640
Your money and other people's.

139
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,370
You want money now?

140
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,990
I don't have it.

141
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,050
Follow procedures?

142
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,820
How about this?

143
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,000
Sell your car.

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,130
Then you'll have money to pay us.

145
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,410
What do you think?

146
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,410
Okay.

147
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,780
I'll make a call to ask about it.

148
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,360
Open the door.

149
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,230
Open the door.

150
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,530
Open the door.

151
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,120
Open the door.

152
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,560
You piece of trash!

153
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
She tricked us.

154
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,920
This is underhand.

155
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,920
She can't avoid us forever.

156
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,110
We…

157
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,710
Let's walk back.

158
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,210
W-Walk back?

159
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,310
You want to help me?

160
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,040
What does your father think about it?

161
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,960
You have to give up your inheritance

162
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,800
so that the assets of Free Unicorn

163
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,110
can be sold at public auction.

164
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,080
What did you say?

165
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,420
Calm down.

166
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,640
The food is getting cold.

167
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,060
Let's talk while we eat.

168
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
I only have enough money

169
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,140
to buy one of Free Unicorn's brands

170
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:47,810
and its office building.

171
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,520
To buy the other brands and the factories,

172
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,510
I need more money.

173
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,670
If you want this to work,

174
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,570
you'll have to give up your inheritance.

175
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,410
That way,

176
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,080
we can buy Free Unicorn back

177
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,860
without getting into debt.

178
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,140
Wenshan.

179
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,800
Are you serious?

180
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,720
My father told you

181
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,560
he'd find a solution, didn't he?

182
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,990
This is the solution he found.

183
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,200
Your family is in the clothing business.

184
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,730
My family owns a distribution company.

185
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,390
We've worked together for more than 20 years.

186
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,910
After my family buys Free Unicorn,

187
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,230
the two companies

188
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,150
can work as a team again.

189
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,050
It's the best

190
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,680
for both you and your dad.

191
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,670
You can

192
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,060
buy Free Unicorn,

193
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,590
but…

194
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,510
But right now,

195
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,630
I don't have that much money

196
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,110
to buy Free Unicorn back

197
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,290
from you.

198
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,400
Jiang Hu.

199
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,130
We grew up together.

200
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,710
Our dads knew each other

201
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,510
before we were born.

202
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,630
Seeing Free Unicorn end up like this,

203
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
my dad and I feel as much pain

204
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,110
as you do.

205
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,440
So,

206
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,840
if you see me

207
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,510
as a true friend,

208
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,930
don't be in a hurry

209
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,720
to raise money.

210
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,390
You can take your time.

211
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,430
Wenshan.

212
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,920
Thank you.

213
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,620
And please thank your father for me.

214
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,550
Since my dad died,

215
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,730
so many people

216
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,150
have stabbed me in the back

217
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,990
and twisted the knife.

218
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,010
I know.

219
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,610
I know.

220
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,720
Trust me.

221
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,400
Everything will be fine.

222
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,690
Here.

223
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,510
Thank you.

224
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,950
Poor girl.

225
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,780
She was humiliated like that

226
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,410
in front of so many people.

227
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,780
She was playing the victim to get sympathy.

228
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,320
Look at her designer clothes

229
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,090
and shoes.

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,880
Free Unicorn racked in a lot of money by fraud.

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,440
Before pitying her,

232
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,300
check

233
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,680
your account balance first.

234
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,260
You're right.

235
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,010
One more.

236
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,910
Okay. Just a moment.

237
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,640
Hi.

238
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,470
Are you alone?

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,510
Hello.

240
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,470
I'm Lisa.

241
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,710
It seems you're alone as well.

242
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,670
Why don't we have a drink together?

243
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,880
Sorry.

244
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,630
He's with me.

245
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,590
Sorry.

246
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,830
A mojito, please.

247
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,050
Am I early?

248
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,400
You're 35 minutes late.

249
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,040
Sometimes,

250
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,100
you're hopelessly dense.

251
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,760
I mean

252
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,640
the pretty girl

253
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,420
who hit on you just now.

254
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,440
I prefer

255
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,110
a beautiful

256
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,610
and elegant lady like you.

257
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,430
All the money I spent on you was worth it.

258
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,380
We have

259
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,260
similar tastes now.

260
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,120
How are things going?

261
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,950
Have you bought a car?

262
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,070
I'm still choosing.

263
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,390
What kind of car are you looking for?

264
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,480
A fast car.

265
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
Why do you want it fast?

266
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,810
Safety comes first.

267
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,560
It has to be fast.

268
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,360

You have spirit.

272
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,640
They'll be heirlooms.

273
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,300
Yeah.

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,310
I kept my word, didn't I?

390
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,710
Wenshan.

391
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,110
Next…

392
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,080
I heard you're going abroad.

393
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,790
Good.

394
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,700
Leave this place.

395
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,140
It has too many memories.

396
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,950
What do you mean?

397
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280
Don't worry about Free Unicorn.

398
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,610
It'll keep running.

399
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,600
I'll respect

400
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,870
your father's wishes

401
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,570
and try not to fire any old employees.

402
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,470
Zhang Wenshan.

403
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,190
This is not

404
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,460
what we agreed to.

405
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,900
You said as long as I give up the inheritance,

406
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,470
you'll help me keep Free Unicorn.

407
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,900
You lied to me.

408
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
I didn't.

409
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,440
This is what I meant.

410
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,120
My family has bought Free Unicorn

411
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,860
but won't change its name.

412
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,120
With our distribution channels,

413
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,470
Free Unicorn will be back in business soon.

414
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,900
What do you think I meant?

415
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,490
How could you?

416
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,640
This is so like you.

417
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,890
You never listened to me carefully.

418
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,080
You never took me seriously.

419
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,880
Jiang Hu.

420
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,270
There is no free lunch in the world.

421
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,730
This is my last gift

422
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,730
to you.

423
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,680
You have to listen to me this time.

424
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,020
Despicable.

425
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,720
Sorry, everyone.

426
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,040
Sorry.

427
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,640
She's in a bad mood.

428
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,410
If you miss this place,

429
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,720
come back anytime.

430
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,520
The door of Free Unicorn

431
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,880
is always open to you.

432
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,230
Boss.

433
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,520
Why did Ms. Jiang

434
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,150
come to the auction

435
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,210
to be humiliated like that?

436
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,160
That was a lot for anyone

437
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,970
to process.

438
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,660
Why did she come?

439
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,510
Because she overestimated humanity.

440
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,110
By the way,

441
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,490
at 10 tomorrow morning,

442
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,470
they'll continue

443
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,460
to auction products

444
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,690
of the subsidiaries under Free Unicorn.

445
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,120
You'll have to buy her land

446
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,270
right in front of her.

447
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,360
Come yourself tomorrow.

448
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm out.

449
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,880
It's scary.

450
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,350
Let's go.

451
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,280
This is the market.

452
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,250
You're

453
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,200
fish in a barrel now.

454
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,180
You brought this on yourself.

455
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,770
Someone has to clean up the mess.

456
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,760
Jiang Hu.

457
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,150
Where are you?

458
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,540
I'm out dealing with something.

459
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,720
Come back to the mansion now.

460
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,470
Those people are crazy.

461
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,530
I couldn't stop them.

462
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:43,740
Call the police.

463
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,180
Call the police.

464
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,100
I did.

465
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
The police are handling it right now.

466
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,490
The maid is making a statement.

467
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,590
There weren't many things

468
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,930
she could keep for you.

469
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,380
Jiang Hu.

470
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,720
Leave here for now.

471
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,640
The rest of the auctions,

472
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,950
liquidation,

473
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,080
and this house,

474
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,640
let me handle them, will you?

475
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,520
Gao Yi.

476
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,430
Gao Yi.

477
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,330
I'll go find Gao Yi.

478
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,350
Maybe he can help me.

479
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,840
Don't go to Gao Yi ever again.

480
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,040
He introduced

481
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,370
Peace Loan to your dad.

482
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,790
What did you say?

483
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,880
At that time,

484
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,270
he worked in Tianyi Investment

485
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,450
under the Hong Kong-based Lidu Group.

486
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,070
He introduced Peace Loan to your dad.

487
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,290
You can imagine how much commission

488
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,040
he earned from it.

489
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,110
But that's not the most important thing.

490
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,760
Before Shen Gui was arrested,

491
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,180
Tianyi Investment

492
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,440
pulled funding

493
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,270
from Peace Loan.

494
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,180
Impossible.

495
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,680
Absolutely impossible.

496
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,950
Gao Yi wouldn't have done that.

497
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,010
Gao Yi.

498
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,070
Gao Yi.

499
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,060
Ms. Jiang.

500
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,350
Mr…

501
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,870
Where is Gao Yi?

502
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,910
Mr. Gao is having a meeting.

503
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,430
Gao Yi.

504
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,270
-Please wait for a moment.
-Gao Yi.

505
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,800
You can have a rest over there.

506
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,070
Gao Yi.

507
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,990
Let me ask you.

508
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,870
Be honest with me.

509
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,790
Did Tianyi Investment

510
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,990
invest in Peace Loan too?

511
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,480
Yes.

512
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,730
Before Peace Loan went bankrupt,

513
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,180
Tianyi Investment pulled out.

514
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,840
Did you tell that

515
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,750
to my dad?

516
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,790
No.

517
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,250
The price of Teng Yue's land

518
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,280
can be reduced by another five points tomorrow.

519
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,920
Well done, Xu Si!

520
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,270
In the future,

521
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,550
you'll head up

522
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,860
the mergers, acquisitions,

523
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,310
and investment management in Baoxing.

524
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,710
And in a few days,

525
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,900
I'll introduce Aneda's chairman

526
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,800
to you.

527
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,850
Aneda Shoes?

528
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,310
They're making acquisitions?

529
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,030
You and your team

530
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,550
did a great job in mergers

531
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,620
and acquisitions in Aixiti.

532
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,890
For you, this case

533
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,460
should be a piece of cake.

534
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,200
Aneda

535
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,510
marks the beginning of Baoxing's M&A projects.

536
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,350
Therefore,

537
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,540
we need an absolute triumph

538
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,920
to kick things off.

539
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,480
Got it.

540
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,370
Xu Si.

541
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,080
If you can prove yourself in this case,

542
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,630
in two years,

543
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,550
you'll be

544
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,870
Baoxing's investment management partner.

545
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,000
You'll be the youngest

546
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,370
managing partner

547
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,450
in this industry.

548
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,370
Thank you for your trust.

549
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,840
I'll do my best.

550
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,800
Also, stay focused

551
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,750
on getting Teng Yue's land.

552
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,750
Keep me posted.

553
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,710
Okay.

554
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,070
Do you know

555
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,330
in this world,

556
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,000
besides my father,

557
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,740
you were the only one

558
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,750
I could trust?

559
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,730
Only you.

560
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,350
Gao Yi.

561
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,130
Besides my father,

562
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,610
you were the only one

563
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,670
I could trust.

564
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,580
Only you.

565
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,670
Are you crazy?

566
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,310
Let go of me!

567
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,540
Let go!

568
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,210
What are you doing?

569
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,910
No.

570
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,070
I'm not stupid.

571
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,900
If I let you go,

572
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
I'll become the first suspect.

573
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,260
Let go!

574
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,910
No.

575
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,880
Let go!

576
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,380
Stop acting like you care.

577
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,070
Do you think I don't know

578
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,410
you're after Teng Yue's land?

579
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,150
You're just like those guys

580
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,520
who twisted the knife.

581
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,280
Despicable!

582
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,510
Let go of me!

583
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,820
Mind your own business!

584
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,230
You're right.

585
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,000
I should mind my own business.

586
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,830
You're in the Jiang family's factory

587
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,850
trying to jump off the Jiang family's building.

588
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,370
If you do,

589
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,540
the price of Teng Yuan's factory

590
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,900
will drop by another ten points tomorrow.

591
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,100
Go ahead and jump off.

592
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,510
Jump off.

593
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,130
Jump off now.

594
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,430
After you do, I'll call the police.

595
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,280
Despicable.

596
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,060
Have you calmed down?

597
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,080
I just want to kindly remind you

598
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,300
that if you jump off,

599
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,780
you'll die covered in blood.

600
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,490
That ain't a good way to go.

601
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,020
Go away.

602
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,180
How about

603
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,090
I tell you a story?

604
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,900
It's a short story.

605
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:04,830
In the 1990s,

606
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,650
there was a state-owned thermos factory.

607
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,600
A technician working there

608
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,280
was kind and generous.

609
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,330
He lent a lot of money to his co-workers.

610
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,750
Later, he lost his job

611
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,639
and couldn't recover those debts.

612
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,030
His kids couldn't afford school

613
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,090
and they struggled to put food on the table.

614
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,310
Wasn't he miserable too?

615
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:24,949
Did he think of jumping off a building?

616
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,830
Yes.

617
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,550
He sat on the roof of the factory

618
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,219
for a whole night.

619
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,000
That night,

620
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,520
he kept thinking about

621
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,280
what he could do next.

622
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,770
When it dawned,

623
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,350
he saw the sun rise again.

624
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,989
He returned to the bankrupt thermos factory,

625
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,760
wrote down the unsold products,

626
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,969
and made a catalog.

627
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,389
After running around for over ten days,

628
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,880
he finally found buyers in Russia.

629
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,990
After that,

630
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,680
all his problems

631
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,680
were solved.

632
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,340
That was how he made his way.

633
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,870
As long as you want,

634
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,800
you can make your way too.

635
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,030
We all have to make our own way.

636
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,550
Teng Yue

637
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,320
is the path I walked.

638
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,290
It's where Free Unicorn started.

639
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,680
It's also where your mom

640
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,900
and I started out.

641
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,470
Your mother passed when you were young.

642
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,620
But I'm still here.

643
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,270
As long as I'm alive,

644
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,350
there's still hope.

645
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,960
Are you done?

646
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,420
The night is dark.

647
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,480
You may be too confused

648
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,390
to know which path

649
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,070
you should choose.

650
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,210
It's easy for you to say.

651
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,980
Going abroad is a path.

652
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,600
Staying around and finding a job

653
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,260
is another path.

654
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,500
Of course,

655
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,630
jumping off the building

656
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,520
is a kind of path too.

657
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,190
Think about it.

658
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,270
What are you doing?

659
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,090
It'll dawn in six hours.

660
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,040
I want to see

661
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,580
when the sun rises,

662
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,400
from which direction

663
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,950
the wind will come.

664
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,540
What's the point of that?

665
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,070
Think about it.

666
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,390
I'll get some sleep.

667
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,380
♫You say the wind picks up♫

668
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,340
♫I close my eyes♫

669
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,300
♫In the air♫

670
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,350
♫I smell regret and nostalgia♫

671
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,530
♫Innocent promises♫

672
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,590
♫Ups and downs♫

673
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,850
♫I just wish to move on♫

674
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,400
♫I know it has all ended♫

675
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,590
♫Like a fulcrum♫

676
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,010
♫It's making time tilt♫

677
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,920
♫In flashbacks♫

678
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,760
♫I see us again♫

679
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,830
♫That adventurous summer with you♫

680
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,640
♫It was not just a season♫

681
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,590
♫The flowers in my heart bloomed♫

682
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,800
♫Then in a determined, romantic, and quiet way♫

683
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,420
♫They withered♫

684
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,860
♫You said in this world♫

685
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,210
♫There are cloudy days and sunny days♫

686
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,750
Where are you going?

687
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,080
♫Your bright face♫

688
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,460
I got something to do.

689
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Find someone else to accompany you.

690
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,840
♫Is like a sun but it's fading away♫

691
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,220
I'm the one who needs company?

692
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,780
♫The wind knows I'm missing you♫

693
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,860
♫When I realize this is love♫

694
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,760
Look at the design of these shoes.

695
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,760
♫You're already gone♫

696
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,800
I think these shoes

697
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,900
don't look comfortable.

698
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,620
Try this, and then…

699
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,250
Keep going.

700
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,330
Show me that drawing.

701
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,470
I think something is wrong

702
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,750
with the data.

703
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,330
Modify it.

704
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,180
Is this

705
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,420
the final decision?

706
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,780
The executives

707
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,610
had a meeting

708
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,770
and decided to fire you.

709
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,620
Ms. Tang.

710
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,940
My career goal has always been

711
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,900
to become an excellent

712
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,060
shoe designer.

713
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,180
It has never changed.

714
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:35,960
Zhaoyang.

715
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,110
As an employee here,

716
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,000
you advertised for a rival product,

717
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,290
which caused Aneda

718
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,010
to be linked to Free Unicorn's marketing campaign.

719
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,840
You violated the professional ethics

720
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,430
expected of an employee.

721
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,500
I understand.

722
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,220
I'm sorry that you have to leave.

723
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,510
Sorry for bothering you.

724
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,770
That's all.

725
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,670
I hope you can

726
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,050
learn from it.

727
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,150
Zhaoyang.

728
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,520
In the future,

729
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,090
you'll have to live on your own.

730
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,510
From now on,

731
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,470
I won't be a burden to you anymore.

732
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,320
You bought stocks again?

733
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,870
How much did you lose this time?

734
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,460
No.

735
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,400
I know you don't like stocks,

736
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,370
so I never bought them again.

737
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,440
I mean it.

738
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,580
I haven't bought any stocks recently.

739
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,980
Then did you get scammed

740
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,470
by your new boyfriend again?

741
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,120
Technically speaking,

742
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,820
it's not my new boyfriend.

743
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,380
I only care for

744
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,060
you and your brother now.

745
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,670
I don't have a boyfriend.

746
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,080
Well,

747
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,720
a guy called Thompson who came back from Canada

748
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,730
introduced Peace Loan to me.

749
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,550
He said the interest rate

750
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,630
was 25%.

751
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,950
I thought

752
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,350
it was more reliable than stocks.

753
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,310
So I borrowed money from him.

754
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,480
How much did you borrow?

755
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,110
It's not my fault.

756
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,010
The boss of Peace Loan

757
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,820
has been arrested.

758
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,630
Even Jiang Hu

759
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,890
whose family owned such a big company

760
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,310
has been impacted,

761
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:03,730
let alone…

762
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,630
How must did you borrow this time?
