00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,590
This is the biggest selling point

192
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,030
TT Media created for you.

193
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,110
The netizens

194
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,280
have very high expectations

195
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,190
of your livestream.

196
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,180
As for me,

197
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,580
I'll maximize your value

198
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,910
and make your first livestream

199
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,750
the stage of Lord Zhaoyang's transformation

200
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,420
into a designer.

201
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,050
Now,

202
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
what do you want me to do?

203
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,810
Livestream on the spot?

204
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,880
Do it here?

205
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,590
First, we'll film a video

206
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,440
about the part you're best at.

207
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,950
I want to show everyone

208
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,520
Lord Zhaoyang's new beginning

209
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,190
with Teng Yue.

210
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,490
One minute countdown.

211
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,830
Okay.

212
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,500
Keep quiet.

213
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,190
Five.

214
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,230
Four.

215
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,510
Three.

216
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,040
I'm Lord Zhaoyang.

217
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,390
I'm also Xiang Zhaoyang

218
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,420
who loves shoe designing.

219
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,720
From today on,

220
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,680
I will start my journey in Teng Yue.

221
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,110
In the near future,

222
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,190
we'll let you see

223
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
a brand new Teng Yue.

224
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:15,610
[Ziyouqi Group]

225
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,700
Jiang Hu is poaching from me.

226
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,470
The order I gave her

227
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,510
helped her feed so many people.

228
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,470
In the end,

229
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,710
for crisis management,

230
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,690
she poached the designer I like.

231
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,630
Well done.

232
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,810
Jiang Hu

233
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,070
grew up with Mr. Jiang,

234
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,880
so she was imperceptibly influenced by him.

235
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,290
Besides, she majored in relative majors

236
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,410
both for her bachelor's and master's degrees.

237
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,540
It's not really unexpected

238
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,630
that she'd make use of

239
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,990
Shangchun Art Project's crisis management

240
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,970
to put on a marketing show

241
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,090
like this.

242
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,660
I underestimated her.

243
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,230
Jiang Hu

244
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,250
has a very clear positioning

245
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
of Teng Yue.

246
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,470
When Mr. Jiang was alive,

247
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,300
he also had similar predictions

248
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,750
of Teng Yue.

249
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,860
It's just

250
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,720
at that time,

251
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,320
he placed more value on the development of Free Unicorn.

252
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,530
He didn't want Teng Yue

253
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,930
to have an overlapping product line of casual shoes

254
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,680
with Free Unicorn.

255
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,880
According to Jiang Hu's current plan,

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm afraid in the future,

257
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,640
the most direct competitor for Free Unicorn

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,980
will be Teng Yue.

259
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,980
I need to rattle her cage.

260
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,920
The three founders

261
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,590
of the application Fanyue

262
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,830
have finally reached a conclusion through argument.

263
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,540
Marketing Vice President Li Yue

264
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,430
has signed the preferred stock withdrawal agreement

265
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,850
with the Board of Directors.

266
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,090
I've already signed it.

267
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,510
Now the last thing we need

268
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,660
is Xu Si's approval.

269
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,150
Remember to tell him to hurry up.

270
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,910
Okay.

271
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,390
Hello.

272
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,990
May I ask if Ms. Tang is back?

273
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,530
Hello.

274
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,200
What?

275
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,290
Flowing Scenery,

276
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,340
Aneda's brand new interpretation

277
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,070
of canvas shoes.

278
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,040
Designed by St. Laurent Design Competition

279
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,060
silver award-winning designer.

280
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,040
A Chinese-style revolution is about to start.

281
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,830
Didn't you say you designed this

282
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,130
for Teng Yue?

283
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,830
Why...

284
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,470
Why did it become Aneda's design?

285
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,930
What does this mean?

286
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,040
Didn't you promise Teng Yue

287
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,990
that this would be the design

288
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,300
for our new series?

289
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Why

290
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,310
did it become Aneda's design?

291
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,800
So...

292
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,350
All our efforts

293
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,280
have been in vain?

294
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,080
So we've all been

295
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,310
messing around and wasting time with you,

296
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,780
right?

297
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,110
Director's worries

298
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,060
are reasonable.

299
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,420
If Aneda uses this design,

300
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,050
we won't have a design for our new series of shoes.

301
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,950
It's too late for us to come up with a new design now.

302
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,820
Even if there is a new design,

303
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,640
it won't be as good as the award-winning one.

304
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,710
In the end,

305
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,000
we'll still be screwed.

306
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,110
Enough.

307
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,470
Since it has happened,

308
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,290
nothing we say can be of help.

309
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,150
Jiang Hu.

310
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,240
I predicted

311
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,140
all possible outcomes,

312
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,070
but I missed out

313
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,590
Aneda's market reaction speed

314
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,830
and supply chain reaction speed

315
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,470
in my predictions.

316
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,230
They're too fast.

317
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,930
No wonder they are one of the top enterprises of the industry.

318
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,000
Are you...

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,070
Are you defending them

320
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,430
now?

321
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,110
They agreed

322
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,050
to sell

323
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,880
that design to you, okay?

324
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,810
Are you out of your mind?

325
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,390
You...

326
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,830
It was my mistake.

327
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,240
I thought Aneda

328
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,830
wouldn't pay much attention to canvas shoes.

329
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,040
So after talking to Tang Ya,

330
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,300
I didn't sign the contract with her immediately.

331
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,750
Whose phone is that?

332
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,360
It keeps beeping

333
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,570
and beeping.

334
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,590
So annoying.

335
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,790
Answer it.

336
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,110
Hello?

337
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,900
The only award-winning design

338
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,380
of Lord Zhaoyang

339
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,120
is Flowing Scenery.

340
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,830
It's the design for the limited edition

341
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,190
of Aneda's canvas shoes for the first quarter.

342
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,870
The distributors have been adding orders.

343
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,190
Shangchun Art Project and Teng Yue

344
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,850
did a good job hyping up the market.

345
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,110
I'm grateful to them

346
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,310
for that.

347
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,710
Jiang Hu is indeed

348
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,640
former President Jiang's daughter.

349
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,510
It's only been less than a week

350
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,040
since their press conference.

351
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,310
I didn't expect

352
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,870
your supply chain reaction speed

353
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,590
could be so fast.

354
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,470
Mr. Mei.

355
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,230
You've been doing due diligence

356
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,830
in Aneda for so long.

357
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,170
You're still not used to

358
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,320
the level of standardization

359
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,630
and the production line speed

360
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,750
of China's shoemaking industry?

361
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:06,870
Yes.

362
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,320
It's just canvas shoes

363
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,550
are not your flagship product.

364
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,820
So I didn't expect

365
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,190
you'd put so much effort

366
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,540
into this category at this stage.

367
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,800
Although our focus has always been

368
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,520
developing the most suitable running shoes for Chinese people,

369
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,590
we wouldn't miss

370
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,710
any chance of increment

371
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,630
provided by the market.

372
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,050
This is also the ultimate goal

373
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,580
of the merger we pursue.

374
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,870
Jiang Hu's event marketing

375
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,980
reminded us that

376
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,310
we should seize the bonus of influencers.

377
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,080
It was indeed our fault

378
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,060
that we didn't keep Xiang Zhaoyang

379
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,070
in Aneda.

380
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,250
Ms. Tang.

381
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
Xiang Zhaoyang is here.

382
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,470
She's been waiting in the reception room

383
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,150
for half an hour.

384
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,560
Go respond to her.

385
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,070
Okay.

386
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,750
Mr. Wang.

387
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,120
Where is Ms. Tang?

388
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,550
Ms. Tang is busy.

389
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,210
Actually,

390
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,100
the HR Department

391
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,830
must have informed you.

392
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,090
Don't worry.

393
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,950
The bonus settled for you

394
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,410
won't be deducted

395
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,280
because you've resigned.

396
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,720
Anyway,

397
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
this is what happened.

398
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,710
Things are really tricky

399
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,600
for Teng Yue this time.

400
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,590
They finally hired

401
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,050
a designer,

402
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,350
yet her most famous design

403
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,920
can't be used.

404
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,420
You'd better let them think of a tactic.

405
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,600
Coming.

406
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,070
I didn't expect

407
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,360
Wan Qi would go this far.

408
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,160
She actually used Thomas to pressure me

409
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,530
when I was pregnant

410
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,550
and forced me to sign the preferred stock withdrawal agreement.

411
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,310
Back when we started up our business together,

412
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,630
from development to operation,

413
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,570
I also put

414
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,710
my whole heart into it.

415
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,060
Now Fanyue just got on the right track,

416
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,470
and they want

417
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,480
to kick down the ladder.

418
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,600
Thank you.

419
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,610
I don't know the conflict

420
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,490
between the three of you very well,

421
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,070
so I'm in no position to speak.

422
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,350
But it's true that

423
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,450
you got fired during your pregnancy.

424
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,030
I will try to get maximum compensation from Wan Qi

425
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,430
for you.

426
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,560
Mr. Xu.

427
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,810
So you also suggest that I quit?

428
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,990
But Fanyue was founded

429
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,710
by the three of us

430
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,570
together.

431
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,150
So the three years

432
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,440
I spent starting up the business with them

433
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,920
were a complete waste of time?

434
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,660
Isn't spending your time and energy

435
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,710
on an

436
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,220
unsustainable business

437
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,440
also a waste?

438
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,810
During this period,

439
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,670
Fanyue's performance

440
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,580
declined seriously

441
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,920
due to your quarrel.

442
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,870
I think

443
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,550
this is not

444
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,800
what you want to see either, right?

445
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,490
But... Can you blame me for that?

446
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,660
There're no co-founders who won't be separated

447
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,230
in this world.

448
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,720
It's just a matter of time.

449
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,790
The best choice is to stop the losses

450
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,790
as soon as possible.

451
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,470
I heard that

452
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,910
the biggest conflict you have

453
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,400
is that you vigorously advocate

454
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,220
incubating recommendation channels

455
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,610
for maternal and child products.

456
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,320
But the section Fanyue covers

457
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,910
is mainly life service and entertainment.

458
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,070
Your decision

459
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,390
is indeed a bit unwise.

460
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,030
However,

461
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,070
it can totally be

462
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,390
an independent project.

463
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,310
The maternal and child industry has great potential.

464
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,480
I heard

465
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,330
you have abundant channels and resources

466
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,260
in this aspect.

467
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,070
And with your current

468
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,630
and future identity,

469
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,940
you're also very suitable for this kind of project.

470
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,020
So if you're interested,

471
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,110
you can show me the project proposal.

472
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,980
Mr. Xu.

473
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,220
You are interested

474
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,220
in my new project?

475
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,320
I hope all the founders I invest in

476
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,990
can achieve success together.

477
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,820
And of course,

478
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,190
I don't want to miss

479
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,310
any good project.

480
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,710
You've enjoyed the drama?

481
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,710
I thought

482
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,470
you specifically asked me

483
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,470
to come and witness an epic gut-wrenching romantic drama.

484
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
Can't the theater in your head

485
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,640
be a little friendly to me?

486
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,490
Well, it depends on

487
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,980
the character set of the male lead.

488
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,030
What's to blame is that

489
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,910
your character loves to invest in

490
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,270
your ex-girlfriend, okay?

491
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,630
A pregnant woman came to your door.

492
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,320
It's hard for me not to overthink.

493
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,080
Can't you

494
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,580
think of as a more noble person?

495
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,520
For example, an investor who supports and encourages

496
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,280
female entrepreneurs?

497
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,130
From Shangchun Art Project

498
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,400
to Fanyue just now,

499
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,160
you've always been

500
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,260
persuading female entrepreneurs to quit.

501
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,830
Sometimes,

502
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,940
you can't win

503
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,230
simply by attacking.

504
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,000
There's a tactic called "retreat to advance".

505
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm all ears.

506
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,840
Don't waste your energy

507
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,500
on disputes that won't bring

508
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,940
any value.

509
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,550
Get over the obstacles,

510
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,860
and you can see further into the future.

511
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,600
I thought

512
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,610
you could say something extraordinary.

513
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,120
Chicken soup for the soul again.

514
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,230
Come on.

515
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,230
Drink it.

516
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,590
Chef Lin

517
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,390
stewed it for three whole hours.

518
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,160
Don't be entangled with

519
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
grease and purine anymore.

520
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,030
Not bad, right?

521
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,750
Not bad.

522
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:27,870
Look.

523
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,260
It's exactly because

524
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,620
I stopped

525
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,280
holding Yang Jian accountable

526
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,930
that I got the dinners for these days

527
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
in exchange.

528
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,640
And you got hyped up.

529
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,830
It seems you've recovered,

530
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,410
right?

531
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,710
Whenever I argue with you,

532
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,960
in the end, I'm always the one who gets pissed off.

533
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,610
I can piss you off?

534
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,400
So that obstacle

535
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,430
is not that much of an obstacle after all?

536
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,680
So you got the news.

537
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,340
Aneda released

538
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,430
Flowing Scenery ahead of you.

539
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,140
Isn't that natural?

540
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,590
That design

541
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,310
was done by Xiang Zhaoyang

542
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,600
when she was working in Aneda.

543
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,610
You shouldn't even think about

544
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,120
using this design.

545
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,040
Your hindsight is perfectly right.

546
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,710
At first,

547
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,460
I did think about using

548
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,790
that design.

549
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,940
Anyway,

550
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,200
she works for me now.

551
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,520
I'll get a new design sooner or later.

552
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,220
So you want me to give you more time?

553
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,470
Don't.

554
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,550
If you

555
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,820
go any easy on me now,

556
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,250
I'd feel uneasy.

557
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,140
I didn't expect I have such a big influence

558
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,550
on you already.

559
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,380
Hello.

560
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,160
Jiang Hu.

561
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,120
Let's have a talk.

562
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,290
The production schedule is tight in the factory recently.

563
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:01,900
I can't leave.

564
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,700
What I want to talk to you about is production.

565
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,080
Fine.

566
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
Something came up. I have to go.

567
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,830
Have the soup while it's warm.

568
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,090
I'll come get the bottle next time.

569
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,250
Bye.

570
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,610
Jiang Hu.

571
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,780
If you encounter any problems,

572
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,320
you can tell me as soon as possible.

573
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,470
After all,

574
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,070
we are partners

575
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,490
in a sense.

576
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,880
You haven't had dinner yet.

577
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,470
Don't forget to eat

578
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,380
after the meeting.

579
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,170
Okay.

580
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,990
Isn't it a bit too formal,

581
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,570
seeing me here?

582
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,150
What would you like to drink?

583
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:13,970
Hello.

Coffee.

585
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,480
Having coffee at this hour

586
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,120
is bad for your health.

587
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,140
I'll have a

588
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,630
-Kiwi juice. Thank you.
-Okay, please wait a moment.

589
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,190
I heard you've been working on

590
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,550
Teng Yue's new product recently.

591
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,200
Yes.

592
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,070
Just like before.

593
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,350
OEM and Teng Yue line work in parallel.

594
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,420
They don't conflict with each other in the factory as well.

595
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,380
It's a good thing that there's no conflict.

596
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,470
You don't know

597
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,680
Teng Yue's previous positioning well, right?

598
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,190
I know it pretty well.

599
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,350
That's why I know better that

600
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:45,990
Teng Yue needs

601
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,030
a higher-level positioning now.

602
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
But this is not the positioning

603
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,570
your dad set before.

605
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,840
Just say what you want to say.

606
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,030
Stop beating around the bush.

607
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,320
I recognize Mr. Jiang's

608
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,670
market experience.

609
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,870
He must have

610
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,800
his own reasons for his judgements.

611
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,340
So,

612
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,140
it's better for Teng Yue

613
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,810
to stick to the low-end positioning.

614
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,600
What if I don't want to?

615
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,570
But our products are too similar.

616
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,640
Have you considered

617
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,750
Free Unicorn's situation?

618
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,160
Free Unicorn?

619
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,180
The current situation of Free Unicorn

620
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
should be your concern, right?

621
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,550
Then if I want to make it fair for Free Unicorn,

622
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,760
I need to stop giving you

623
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,070
OEM orders.

624
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,370
Is there no room for discussion?

625
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,180
Unless you can...

626
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,640
Fine.

627
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,790
Teng Yue can give up

628
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,790
Free Unicorn's OEM orders.

629
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,710
But I won't give up

630
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,630
Teng Yue's new positioning

631
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,310

You can't just

take all the benefits.

637
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,630
I can't.

638
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,640
Neither can you.

639
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,840
I've thought it through.

That's it.

[Beginning with Jiang Hu] [Running against the wind]

Let's have

646
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,970
a product discussion meeting tomorrow.

647
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,470
I'll submit my new design.

648
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,420
Okay.

649
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,100
[Deconstruction diagram]

650
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,870
As the first pair of shoes for the new Teng Yue,

651
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,510
I hope it can be the best.

652
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,100
The shoes need to be comfortable

653
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,910
and on-trend for three years.

654
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,650
That's why

655
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,390
I aim to bring back

656
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,920
Teng Yue's history and DNA

657
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,470
on the basis of

658
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,750
the basic design.

659
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,590
Teng Yue's best-selling shoes

660
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,360
were numbered Victory at One Stroke.

661
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,730
The design was simple and powerful.

662
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,810
I also made some modifications

663
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,950
to the structure.

664
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,780
But

665
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,390
the most important thing is

666
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,950
the improvement of materials and crafts.

667
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,090
I want to repackage Teng Yue's old design

668
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,640
with a new concept.

669
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,390
There's a problem.

670
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,800
You said

671
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,470
you want to use

672
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,100
thickened wool fabric from New Zealand

673
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,650
for the uppers?

674
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,400
It's to improve the duration

675
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,260
and resilience of the shoes.

676
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,550
And why do you want to use

677
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,990
wool fabric

678
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,890
with natural castor oil drops

679
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,730
for the insoles?

680
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,050
Moisture absorption, perspiration and odor removal

681
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,130
are very important.

682
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,740
So

683
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,330
we also need to buy

684
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,370
a design patent for deodorization and perspiration

685
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,430
to use on the insoles.

686
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,780
Also,

687
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,250
what's with this

688
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,780
100-micrometer

689
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,950
super thin splashing water-proof breathable coating?

690
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,750
The breathable coating

691
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,920
can be added

692
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,560
between the woolen upper

693
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,090
and the inner surface.

694
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,310
Well,

695
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,880
have you calculated

696
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,020
how much it will cost?

697
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,670
Don't you know how much it will be?

698
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,420
If we calculate it,

699
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,200
a pair of shoes like this will cost a lot.

700
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,680
We need to ensure

701
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,230
the gross profit is at least 80%.

702
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,670
The price of your shoes

703
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,400
will at least be above 500,

704
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,340
or even higher.

705
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,620
It's too expensive.

706
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,640
It will cost 600 yuan.

707
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,260
The cost is too high.

708
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,760
It's too expensive.

709
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,350
What kind of shoes are these?

710
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,910
The shoes I want are also high-quality,

711
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,570
comfortable,

712
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,760
and on-trend for three years.

713
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,740
But its price

714
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,580
must be within 200 yuan.

715
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,660
The target consumers

716
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,710
of the shoes priced 599 yuan

717
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,070
are not the customers Teng Yue has been serving

718
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,480
or will serve.

719
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,380
But 200-yuan shoes

720
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,050
will be too popular that everyone wears them.

721
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,630
That's why I need you to design

722
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,420
high-quality, comfortable shoes that can be

723
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,450
on-trend for three years.

724
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,410
But at the same time,

725
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,760
they shouldn't be so popular that everyone wears it.

726
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,620
While my mission

727
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,620
is to sell them all

728
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,550
in the shortest time.

729
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,090
Jiang Hu.

730
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,470
You're seeking instant success.

731
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,900
What you are designing now

732
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,600
is Teng Yue's canvas shoes,

733
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,310
not Aneda's sneakers.

734
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,340
Besides,

735
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,740
the price of Aneda's canvas shoes

736
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,890
is only 179.

737
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,950
Zhaoyang.

738
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,750
Well.

739
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,310
Can I ask you a question?

740
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,570
What did we hire,

741
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,920
a designer or a senior?

742
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,930
What's with her temper?

743
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,860
It's okay.

744
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,650
If she doesn't want to work,

745
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
let's fire her

746
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,670
and get a new designer

747
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,160
who's more obedient.

748
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,230
Enough.

749
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,930
That's all for today's meeting.

750
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,040
We'll talk about

751
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,210
the design later.

752
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,360
Thank you.

753
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,310
The cost is above 500.

754
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,530
It's too high for us

755
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,860
and Teng Yue's target customers,

756
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,160
right?

757
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,500
I knew it

758
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,760
at a glance.

759
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,690
It's too expensive.

760
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,400
About Zhaoyang...

761
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,090
Ms. Yue.

762
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,550
Look.

763
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,020
These are still Teng Yue's shoes.

764
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,390
But the toes,

765
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,990
outsoles,

766
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,250
and the separate soles

767
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,880
do look better

768
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,560
after these adjustments, right?

769
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,390
To be honest,

770
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,290
I personally

771
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,690
admire her talent very much.

772
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,240
From the design of the shoes

773
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,570
to the inside structure of the shoes,

774
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,140
including the comfort level,

775
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,670
she's very exquisite about them.

776
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,260
And I think she's put her heart into it.

777
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,770
So,

778
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,180
it's actually my fault.

779
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,560
I didn't tell her

780
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,310
my needs in advance.

781
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,670
It's okay.

782
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,850
Talk nicely to her

783
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,080
and let her know your thoughts

784
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,970
clearly.

785
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:25,860
[Changle Restaurant]

786
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,480
Look.

787
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Our online store

788
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,810
has always been

789
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,510
short-handed.

790
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,370
What's that saying again?

791
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,710
Minimum manpower?

792
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,360
In the future,

793
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,390
if Teng Yue's goods will sell well,

794
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,250
I'm afraid we won't have enough manpower

795
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,990
to share with her.

796
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,650
What?

797
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,140
You're so obedient to her now?

798
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:45,970
Well...

799
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,350
The time has changed.

800
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,380
It takes time to know a talent.

801
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,630
Jiang Hu has thought through

802
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,540
what you're thinking about long ago.

803
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,200
They had a meeting the other day and finalized it.

804
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,910
She only needs Wu

805
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,980
to run Teng Yue's online store.

806
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,790
So she won't need our customer service staff?

807
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,450
She'll ask two workers from the factory

808
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,840
to go work for Wu.

809
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,990
This way, Wu can also

810
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,300
give them training on e-commerce procedures.

811
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,390
But when the disciples master the knowledge,

812
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,900
maybe the master will lose his job, right?

813
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,639
She won't.

814
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,760
Aren't you having a product meeting?

815
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,980
Why are you back so early?

816
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,670
What's wrong?

817
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,510
Did something happen

818
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,310
in your factory?

819
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,730
Nothing.

820
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,140
Nothing?

821
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,750
How could she be like this if nothing happened?

822
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,880
Since you work in Teng Yue now,

823
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,750
you no longer recognize me as your boss, right?

824
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,380
No.

825
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,870
I just don't want to snitch on her.

826
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,970
It'll be bad for Jiang Hu

827
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,850
and for you.

828
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,020
I just want to know what happened.

829
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,270
I won't tell anyone

830
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:58,970
you told me that.

831
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,470
It's not a big deal, actually.

832
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,280
It's just

833
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,410
they had a product discussion meeting today.

834
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,830
Zhaoyang's latest design

835
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,410
was rejected.

836
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,090
What are you doing?

837
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,800
Eat after Zhaoyang finishes drawing.

838
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,920
Xu Si.

839
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,570
You can't

840
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,510
just mess with me

841
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,900
since I have to take care of your dinners.

842
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,980
Bacon garlic soup?

843
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,670
Won't it be good

844
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,550
if it's made by Chef Lin?

845
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,590
Won't it be good if we order takeout?

846
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Unbelievable.

847
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,270
All right.

848
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,470
You...

849
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,410
You are

850
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,110
trying to kill a Virgo.

851
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,270
You're not a Virgo.

852
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,470
My Ascendant is Virgo, all right?

853
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,430
You forced me.

854
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,190
It's so hard

855
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,700
to get you to cook for me.

856
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,670
What are you doing?

857
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,670
Teaching you how to cut garlic.

858
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,530
You did it on purpose, right?

859
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,080
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

860
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,590
You're so bad.

861
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,840
Be careful. Don't cut your hand.

862
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,700
I'll go get the door.

863
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:02,720
Ms. Li.

864
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,620
Mr. Xu.

865
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,230
I brought the project proposal here today.

866
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,190
I want to make

867
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,430
a brief introduction of the new project to you.

868
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,510
Okay.

869
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,120
Come in.

870
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm sorry.

871
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I didn't tell you in advance.

872
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,790
I hope I'm not disturbing

873
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,730
you and your girlfriend.

874
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,200
No.

875
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,250
Of course not.

876
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,150
My girlfriend wouldn't mind.

877
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,290
Have a seat.

878
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,890
Nonsense.

879
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,080
What are you doing?

880
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,310
Stop drawing.

881
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,840
You can draw after eating.

882
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,960
Come on and eat.

883
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,860
The dishes are getting cold.

884
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,810
I'm out of ideas.

885
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,610
I thought for a long time,

886
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,200
but

887
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,150
I got nothing.

888
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,850
What's that saying again?

889
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:20,930
Concern causes confusion.

890
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,740
It's not that.

891
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,680
Something with similar meaning.

892
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,050
You just think too much

893
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,920
and you're a bit too eager.

894
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,480
Try it.

895
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,740
Am I right?

896
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,410
I took design,

897
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,630
especially canvas design,

898
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,780
too simple.

899
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,010
Here.

900
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,460
Try this.

901
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,030
Do you remember when we were little?

902
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,780
We used to eat

903
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,460
under that wall

904
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,590
a lot.

905
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Whenever you were thinking about something,

906
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,770
you'd draw on that wall.

907
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,580
I forget

908
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,200
when I got

909
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,230
this habit.

910
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,110
Since your school

911
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,540
asked you to wear red shoes.

912
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,480
Your school choir

913
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,880
asked you all to be dressed in uniform clothing,

914
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,280
white shirts and red shoes.

915
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,910
After you came back home, you tried to figure something out for a long time.

916
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:18,930
That wall

917
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,280
became a landscape painting because of you.

918
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,390
In the end, you came up with

919
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,730
the idea to paint the shoes red, right?

920
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,630
I remember now.

921
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,350
Mom thought the choir

922
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,530
was nothing important back then.

923
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,160
You see.

924
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,420
Solutions are to be thought of.

925
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,930
Nothing has ever stumped you

926
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,800
since childhood.

927
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,630
Take your time.

928
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,090
There will be a way.

929
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,160
You can do it.

930
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,860
I won't give up.

931
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,040
About the market penetration you mentioned,

932
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,380
I'll calculate it carefully later.

933
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:05,900
Okay.

934
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,580
I'll wait for your new statistics.

935
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,950
I've signed the stock withdrawal agreement

936
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,460
this morning.

937
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,840
You were right.

938
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,680
I shouldn't waste my time

939
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,590
on the conflict

940
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,330
of our breakup.

941
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,860
To be efficient is the best way

942
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,630
to be responsible for a founder's career.

943
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,450
Breaking up with your former partners

944
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,650
is not necessarily a bad thing.

945
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,200
Your next track

946
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,630
will be better.

947
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,680
I'm leaving then.

948
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,630
Okay, I'll see you off.

949
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,160
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

950
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,320
Okay, take care.

951
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,360
When I heard the noise from the kitchen,

952
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:57,990
I knew

953
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,530
our dinner was ruined.

954
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,810
As expected.

955
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,010
It proves that

956
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,730
the takeout bacon garlic soup

957
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
must taste better than what I cooked.

958
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,250
It proves that

959
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,140
in the end,

960
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,690
I still didn't get

961
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,050
to have a dinner cooked by you.

962
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,890
How about you

963
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,080
cook for me, young master?

964
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,330
Forget it.

965
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,200
Let's order takeout.

966
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,590
You know that?

967
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,740
Do as you would be done by.

968
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,240
I've ordered.

969
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,020
Come sit and wait.

970
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,410
Why are you sitting so far away?

971
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,470
Is it weird?

972
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,350
This is the normal social distance

973
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,110
between an investor and a founder.

974
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,040
Are you trying to piss me off?

975
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,510
How could I?

976
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,640
Our cooperation

977
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,590
is going so well, right?

978
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,930
Let's cooperate again then.
