00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,040
Come on.

195
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,230
Come on.

196
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,350
Come on.

197
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,470
Come on.

198
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:36,950
Here.

199
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,110
Make a wish.

200
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,030
Let's blow out the candles together.

201
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,140
Three, two, one.

202
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
Happy birthday!

203
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,010
Mr. Gao, thank you.

204
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,150
If you need anything else,

205
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,070
feel free to contact me.

206
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:44,820
See you around.

207
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,780
Okay, see you.

208
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,870
Designer Xiang.

209
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,810
You guys talk first.

210
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,060
I'm leaving.

211
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,670
See you.

212
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,470
Zhaoyang.

213
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,200
Come in.

214
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,310
Did you wait long?

215
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,360
Not really.

216
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,020
By the way,

217
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,530
if I remember correctly,

218
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,470
you must like

219
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,630
the butterfly pastry from this store.

220
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,400
I remember

221
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,470
you often went to this shop

222
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,610
for their butterfly pastries.

223
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,430
I was just passing by,

224
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,800
so I bought some for you.

225
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,910
It's been so long.

226
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,670
You still remember it.

227
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,830
Thank you.

228
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,540
Have a seat.

229
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,510
Okay.

230
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,870
Also,

231
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,840
for Lidu's event this time,

232
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,990
I also want to hear

233
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,390
your opinion on our proposal.

234
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,950
The proposal is not bad.

235
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,750
The design of the exhibition booth is also great.

236
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,100
I believe

237
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
many consumers

238
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,080
will be attracted by the nostalgia.

239
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,670
I'm relieved to hear that.

240
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,680
You must be the one

241
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,750
who designed the exhibition booth.

242
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,530
You can tell?

243
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,360
It's in your distinct art style.

244
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,350
Thank you

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,280
for giving Teng Yue this chance.

246
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,320
But Zhaoyang,

247
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,590
do you have

248
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,230
any other

249
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,590
bundles and promotions?

250
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,700
You think it's not enough, right?

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,950
A little.

252
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,740
Regardless,

253
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,060
we have approved

254
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
your proposal.

255
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,370
Bundles and promotions

256
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,840
are always

257
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,150
managed solely by Jiang Hu.

258
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,590
She hasn't told me about

259
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,590
her plans

260
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,070
and proposal this time.

261
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,930
But there is one thing

262
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,720
I have to tell you.

263
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,500
Free Unicorn

264
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,710
requested three-quarters

265
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,590
of the whole venue area.

266
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,380
That much?

267
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,740
On top of that,

268
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
they are planning to

269
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,710
collaborate with

270
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,450
Next Model Management.

271
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,620
They hired international models for a show?

272
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,830
So I hope

273
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,220
you can further discuss things

274
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,890
with Jiang Hu when you go back.

275
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,710
Okay.

276
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,310
Thank you,

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,640
Gao Yi.

278
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,730
You’re welcome.

279
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
But this is your company's

280
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,230
internal event.

281
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,110
You invited me, an outsider...

282
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,430
Because I don't want to treat you

283
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,990
as an outsider, Ms. Song.

284
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,570
Jiali.

285
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,950
Ms. Jiang

286
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,070
has always wanted to invite you

287
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,230
to join Teng Yue.

288
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Your team is so young.

289
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,840
It's not appropriate for me at my age.

290
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,370
Ms. Song.

291
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,420
You're exaggerating.

292
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,230
In our eyes,

293
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,630
you're young and energetic.

294
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,340
Exactly.

295
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,150
I know

296
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,170
you went to Suzhou

297
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
to work as a textile middleman

298
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,710
for the online shop there

299
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,340
for years without a break.

300
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,680
Besides, your daughter is married now.

301
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,060
Won't you have to move here?

302
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,450
Wouldn't it be hard for you

303
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,710
to constantly travel between the two places?

304
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,230
That's right.

305
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,320
I know

306
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,870
you don't want to leave your daughter.

307
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,230
So I plucked up the courage

308
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,070
to take advantage of

309
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,800
you, my regular business partner.

310
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,190
Teng Yue is right here.

311
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,900
You don't have to travel far and away

312
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,710
to continue pursuing

313
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,070
your favorite career.

314
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,880
Ms. Song.

315
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,310
I hope

316
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,650
you can give me a chance.

317
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,350
Give Teng Yue a chance too.

318
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,810
I think

319
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,150
this is also my mother's wish.

320
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,990
Okay.

321
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,320
Welcome onboard.

322
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,470
Great, Ms. Song.

323
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Zhaoyang is having a meeting at Lidu.

324
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,970
Lidu?

325
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,140
Boss.

326
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:17,870
Do you know

327
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,710
what you look like

328
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,480
in this outfit?

329
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,990
Like what?

330
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,630
Like a big boss.

331
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,290
-Like Batman.
-Like the factory director.

332
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,030
Really.

333
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,200
Let me try wearing it.

334
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,070
Let me try wearing it.

335
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,710
Let me help you take it off.

336
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,590
Let me see if I'll look like one too.

337
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,350
Try what?

338
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,630
See if I'll look like a factory director.

339
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,990
Why are you

340
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,950
wearing my coat?

341
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,720
Take it off right now.

342
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,760
Bugger off.

343
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,790
Let me try.

344
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,700
Let me try.

345
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,010
Don't remove my tie.

346
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,730
Let me try.

347
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Stop it.

348
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,900
So many people are here.

349
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,800
Things are so good now.

350
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,060
It wasn't this good in the past.

351
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,730
The factory celebrates workers' birthdays now.

352
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,360
I would have never imagined it.

353
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:51,910
Teng Yue

354
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,520
hasn't been so lively in a long time.

355
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,290
Right?

356
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,050
It used to be so gloomy.

357
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,630
Since

358
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,870
the youngsters took over,

359
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,080
everything has changed.

360
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,830
Yes.

361
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,130
So you see,

362
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,990
we need to

363
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,770
change our mindsets too.

364
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,400
We used to focus

365
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,230
solely on making shoes.

366
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,390
We had no innovation.

367
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,130
Now,

368
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,190
we need to know

369
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,310
how to live and enjoy life.

370
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,510
We need to keep pace with the times.

371
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,900
Yes.

372
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,130
How can we not grow old?

373
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,400
We have successors now.

374
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,990
It's great.

375
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,590
You finally remembered about me.

376
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,960
Boss,

377
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,800
can you tell me

378
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,420
in advance

379
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,480
before visiting next time?

380
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,710
This way, I can make the proper arrangements.

381
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,810
No need.

382
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,750
When I miss you,

383
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,230
I'll naturally visit.

384
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,160
We're in public.

385
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,830
Can you not say that?

386
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,450
Okay.

387
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,090
Let's talk about something else.

388
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,420
Let me ask you.

389
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,710
What's with

390
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,390
Yang Jian

391
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,270
and his suit?

392
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,050
Let me tell you.

393
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,830
For my birthday,

394
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,040
you're not allowed to

395
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,380
gift me this brand of clothes.

396
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,880
I don't like wearing the same clothes as others.

397
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,400
Your birthday is far away.

398
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,520
Who said that?

399
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,700
Today is my birthday.

400
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,460
You didn't know?

401
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,890
Really?

402
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,740
Nice try.

403
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,370
I know the birth date of every employee

404
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,680
and business partner of mine.

405
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,940
Then you have enough time

406
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,510
to decide on a gift

407
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,760
for me.

408
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,880
You're so petty.

409
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,150
Let go.

410
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,880
People are watching.

411
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,580
No one is watching.

412
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,470
Yes, they will see it later.

413
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,650
No one will.

414
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,910
Mr. Xu, Ms. Jiang.

415
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,460
Have some cake.

416
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,560
Sure.

417
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I like cakes.

418
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,740
Have some.

419
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,520
Okay.

420
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,430
Okay.

421
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,230
Ms. Jiang.

422
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,730
Have some cake.

423
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

424
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,380
Thank you, Dacheng.

425
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,330
Thank you.

426
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,410
Okay.

427
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,750
Have some cake.

428
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,500
Have a bite.

429
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,390
Take a bite.

430
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,950
So Mr. Xu is left-handed.

431
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,360
I didn't know that before.

432
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,400
Here, eat up.

433
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,220
You dropped it.

434
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,030
It dropped. Here.

435
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,190
Happy birthday.

436
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,750
Thank you.

437
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,410
Zhaoyang, are you done with work?

438
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,190
Sorry.

439
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,910
I'm late.

440
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,550
It's okay.

441
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,870
You look handsome

442
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,180
in a suit.

443
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,150
Really?

444
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,950
You like it?

445
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,910
Happy birthday.

446
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,110
Thank you.

447
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,110
Do you want something to eat?

448
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,030
No for now.

449
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm looking for Jiang Hu.

450
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,190
We have a situation.

451
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,420
She's over there.

452
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,900
Jiang Hu.

453
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,830
You're here.

454
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,600
The booth map is out.

455
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,990
Free Unicorn

456
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,580
is in the same booth as us.

457
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,750
But

458
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,870
their allocated time

459
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,880
is three times more than ours.

460
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,950
What?

461
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
They invited international models

462
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,230
for a runway show.

463
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,680
That means Free Unicorn's event

464
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,880
will be a big deal this time.

465
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,790
They put Free Unicorn and Teng Yue,

466
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,020
both of which once belonged to my father,

467
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,450
together in an event.

468
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,590
No matter how the event turns out,

469
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,170
Lidu will be the biggest winner.

470
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,560
This will give people a lot to talk about.

471
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,710
Gao Yi

472
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,990
played a good hand this time.

473
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,300
I've done all my tasks.

474
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,650
In the next few days,

475
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,950
I'll oversee the booth construction.

476
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,710
Do you want to think of

477
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,060
any better promotion ideas?

478
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,340
Why did your expression change after hearing

479
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,080
it was Gao Yi’s arrangement?

480
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,210
Don't worry.

481
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,230
About what?

482
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,750
As the shareholder of Teng Yue,

483
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,120
I hope you can rest assured.

484
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
I won't lose.

485
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,710
After this event,

486
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,470
Teng Yue's offline channel

487
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,550
will be established.

488
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,230
Jiang Hu.

489
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,230
You are too competitive.

490
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,120
I won't lose.

491
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,600
Right?

492
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,850
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

493
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,230
Take a left turn ahead.

494
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,160
Okay.

495
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,800
Happy birthday.

496
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,830
Every birthday,

497
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,930
I look forward to this the most.

498
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,430
They have never changed the recipe

499
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,600
of their shortcakes,

500
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,570
so their outlets are becoming scarce.

501
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,870
I had a hard time

502
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,910
finding an outlet this year.

503
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,460
The one last year closed down?

504
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,550
You must have spent a long time

505
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,420
looking for this shop.

506
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,750
It didn't take that long.

507
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,810
My birthday is complete now.

508
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,830
Thank you.

509
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,510
Let's go.

510
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,710
Let's go.

511
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,530
Safety belt.

512
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,500
Well...

513
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,590
What's wrong?

514
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,200
Here.

515
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,950
This is...

516
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,710
On my birthday,

517
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,930
you cooked me a bowl of noodles.

518
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,870
I don't want to owe you anything.

519
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,610
So I bought you this

520
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,360
as a gift in return.

521
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,700
Happy birthday.

522
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,470
How did you know

523
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:17,880
I like the shortcake

524
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,070
from this shop?

525
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,900
Didn't you say that

526
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,610
your mom used to buy it for you?

527
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,470
Thank you.

528
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,560
Come in.

529
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,120
Why are you here?

530
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,000
Happy birthday.

531
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,590
I knew you'd be doing this.

532
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,360
No matter what dishes Qi, Wu, and I

533
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,410
prepare for you,

534
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,990
they can't compare

535
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,620
to the shortcake from Zhaoyang.

536
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,730
It started when she was 15...

537
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,230
It has been more than 10 years, right?

538
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,030
It has never changed.

539
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,560
She doesn't change.

540
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,890
You don't change either.

541
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,560
This is called the

542
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,960
tacit understanding between childhood sweethearts.

543
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,630
This piece of cake

544
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,620
kept you happy for so many years.

545
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,080
But look at you.

546
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,200
Every single year,

547
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,120
you cooked different dishes for her birthday.

548
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,910
You

549
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,900
should wake up now.

550
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,040
By the way,

551
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,290
Wu told me

552
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,140
Zhaoyang went to see Gao Yi today.

553
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,000
You should know who Gao Yi is.

554
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,470
I remember

555
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,120
Zhaoyang

556
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,190
was interested in

557
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,450
Gao Yi since she was young.

558
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,380
Well,

559
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,870
Gao Yi is back now.

560
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,210
He is successful

561
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,390
and handsome.

562
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,210
I heard that he's still single.

563
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,200
If these two

564
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,470
continue to keep in touch,

565
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,190
then...

566
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,520
Girls, you know?

567
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,550
I'm afraid that her old love will rekindle.

568
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,270
You know what I mean, right?

569
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,650
I know.

570
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,900
I saw Gao Yi send her home.

571
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,770
Then why did you...

572
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,790
It's fine.

573
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,760
As long as she likes it.

574
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,430
I

575
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,510
just need to

576
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,670
happily marry her off.

577
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,730
This is my responsibility.

578
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,910
You're so stubborn.

579
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,280
Happy birthday.

580
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:19,980
Thanks.

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,110
Aneda is

583
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,710
progressing the merger

584
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,630
faster than we expected.

585
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,320
I think the whole process

586
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,190
will take less than two years.

587
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,120
Prepare to schedule a project meeting

588
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,220
with Mei's secretary.

589
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:35,990
Okay.

590
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,620
But there's one more thing.

591
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,950
Jingyang has other brands.

592
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,660
I think

593
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,640
there should be no problem.

594
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,360
But should we

595
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,010
inform Teng Yue first?

596
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,090
Not for now.

597
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,920
Teng Yue hasn't developed

598
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,420
to the extent of attracting Aneda's interest.

599
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,140
I think

600
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,670
we should still

601
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,710
take our precautions.

602
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,650
Don't look at me like that.

603
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,550
This is just

604
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,630
a personal suggestion.

605
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,350
A suggestion.

606
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,480
I'm leaving.

607
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,910
Not this one.

608
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,110
Just follow this one.

609
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:16,840
Okay.

610
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,640
We'll make it according to this.

611
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,440
Yes.

612
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,990
Okay.

613
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,430
Okay.

614
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,470
Okay.

615
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,950
Hold on.

616
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,630
Mr. Xu.

617
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,380
What brings you here?

618
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,400
Why are you here now?

619
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,240
I'm looking for Jiang Hu.

620
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,650
Is she upstairs?

621
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,930
She went out yesterday afternoon

622
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,200
and hasn't returned.

623
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,030
I thought...

624
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,560
You thought what?

625
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,230
I...

626
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,540
I thought you two...

627
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,390
I thought

628
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,330
you two were together.

629
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,550
Aren't you two

630
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,890
dating right now?

631
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,660
In my opinion,

632
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,510
if you and Jiang Hu

633
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,070
become a couple,

634
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,490
it would be great.

635
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,070
You should know,

636
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,520
my brother-in-law

637
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,880
had standards for

638
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,740
choosing a son-in-law.

639
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,370
According to those standards,

640
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,210
you exceed all the expectations.

641
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,280
All of them.

642
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,920
Our family is only missing

643
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,110
your type of DNA.

644
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,190
If you

645
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,190
become a couple with Jiang Hu,

646
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,330
I can...

647
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,590
I can rest assured.

648
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,700
You have my support.

649
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,890
You have my support.

650
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,230
Thank you.

651
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,910
Mr. Pei.

652
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,270
Well,

653
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,260
you'd better keep an eye

654
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,290
on the production line.

655
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,030
I'm leaving.

656
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:24,950
You...

657
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,920
You can call her.

658
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,460
Okay.

659
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,650
Hello.

660
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,890
Where are you?

661
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,020
Why didn't you answer your phone?

662
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,840
I came out to run an errand.

663
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,480
The signal here is bad.

664
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,910
-I fell asleep just now.
-Where are you?

665
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,710
I'll pick you up.

666
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,680
I'm in Studio City.

667
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,870
There's a

668
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,930
shooting location here.

669
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,150
Okay.

670
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,170
Send me your location.

671
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,070
Okay.

672
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,080
I'll send it to you right away.

673
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,710
Xiangwan.

674
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,150
Are you in Studio City?

675
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,700
Give me your location.

676

[Jiang Hu]

677
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,440
Hello,

678
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,580
the phone you are calling is powered off.

679
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,310
The phone you are calling

680
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,410
is powered off.

681
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Hello,

682
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,200
the phone you are calling is powered off.

683
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,010
The phone you are calling

684
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,760
is powered off.

685
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,040
What's going on?

686
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,360
Hello,

687
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,450
the phone you are calling is powered off.

688
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,320
The phone you are calling

689
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,120
is powered off.

690
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,790
Hello,

691
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,960
the phone you are calling is powered off.

692
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,310
Brother.

693
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,030
Hello.

694
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,910
What brother?

695
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,800
What kind of brother watches after the washrooms?

696
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,050
Call me sir.

697
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,310
Sir.

698
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:07,770
Well,

699
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,270
my phone is out of battery.

700
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,310
Do you have a socket?

701
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,570
Can I borrow it to charge my phone?

702
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,909
How unfortunate.

703
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,310
I have

704
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,620
a men's washroom and a women's washroom.

705
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,080
You can use the washrooms.

706
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,120
As for this...

707
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,239
I don't care.

708
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,300
You can do whatever you want.

709
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,570
[Jiang Hu]

710
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,590
Young lady.

711
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,110
What are you doing here?

712
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,790
I'm waiting for my phone to charge.

713
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,510
The ringing phone.

714
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,310
Is it yours?

715
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,330
Yes.

716
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,960
Sir, can you take it out for me?

717
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,540
Thank you.

718
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,320
Thank you.

719
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,350
The ringtone sounds nice.

720
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,790
Thank you.

721
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,830
Hello?

722
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,940
My phone died just now.

723
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,830
I'll be there soon.

724
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,980
Send me the exact location.

725
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,740
Okay.

726
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,310
Thank you, sir.

727
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:31,760
Thank you.

728
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,800
You're finally here.

729
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:55,960
Is this

730
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,510
your attitude towards your boyfriend?

731
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,170
You didn't answer your phone

732
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,430
and didn't report your location.

733
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,190
You left the city without a word.

734
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,920
Is this something you should do?

735
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,750
I...

736
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,700
I fell asleep by accident.

737
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,940
My phone died too.

738
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,670
Mr. Xu is so fierce.

739
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,240
Then I can be nicer too.

740
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,760
Stop it.

741
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,120
I'm in a hurry.

742
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,150
Why are you in a hurry?

743
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,800
He's watching.

744
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,410
Sir, I'm leaving.

745
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,210
Thank you.

746
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,150
Let's go.

747
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:28,700
Bye.

748
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,530
Bye. Bye.

749
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,450
Let's go.

750
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,250
Let's go to where you parked your car

751
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,610
and call a tow truck

752
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,060
before we go back.

753
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,080
No.

754
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,440
Before we go back,

755
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,730
there's a stop I have to make.

756
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,860
Lead the way.

757
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,180
Okay, Boss.

758
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,460
Are you leaving now?

759
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,530
Okay.

760
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,670
You're going to the set alone?

761
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,810
What about Jiang Hu?

762
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,110
She's not back from

763
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,820
her errand yet.

764
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,620
I'll accompany you.

765
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,280
Get in my car.

766
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
I've arranged everything for the

767
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,810
exhibition booth construction tonight.

768
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,540
Your agency doesn't need to

769
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,380
help us so much.

770
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,470
Wu can handle

771
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,800
the agency alone.

772
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,990
I'll go with you.

773
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,430
Maybe I can help here and there.

774
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:32,880
No need.

775
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,680
In terms of work,

776
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,070
we should

777
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,310
do our own jobs.

778
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,670
I'm leaving.

779
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,310
What are you thinking?

780
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,530
You seem troubled.

781
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,430
Nothing.

782
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,670
You don't want to tell me?

783
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,420
Then eat first.

784
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,450
It will take four hours to go back.

785
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,920
Don't starve yourself.

786
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,240
I'm starving.

787
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,990
Send me to Lidu.

788
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,030
Okay, Boss.

789
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,580
Bye.

790
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,670
Can you help me

791
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,960
tighten the screw up there?

792
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,620
Zhaoyang.

793
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,370
Sorry.

794
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,910
Sorry for being late.

795
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:50,920
How is it?

796
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,310
Almost done.

797
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,720
It's up to you

798
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,860
if the event tomorrow

799
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,890
can meet our expectations.

800
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,740
Thank you.

801
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,870
Have you eaten?

802
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,520
Not yet.

803
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,230
Let's go.

804
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,160
Let's go.

805
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,870
I never thought that one day

806
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,440
we would be sitting here

807
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,370
as calm as we are now,

808
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,170
doing the same thing

809
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,060
for the same goal.

810
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,040
When I was young,

811
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,110
I once thought

812
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,690
you were my biggest hater

813
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,890
in this world.

814
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,300
Don't assume that's not the case now.

815
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,720
Zhaoyang.

816
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,460
Actually, back then,

817
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,550
I didn't mean to

818
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,130
snatch your direct admission spot.

819
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,440
I know.

820
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,060
We've been competing

821
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,500
against each other since we were kids.

822
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,710
We competed for the class president role,

823
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,520
for the flag raiser role,

824
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,570
for the lead vocalist role of the choir,

825
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,420
and...

826
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,870
For Gao Yi.

827
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,790
You broke up with Gao Yi

828
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,790
because of Free Unicorn, right?

829
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,390
He told you?

830
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,440
Both of you were reserved to tell me anything.

831
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,340
I thought about it for a long time.

832
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,790
The only thing that could

833
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,380
split up the both of you

834
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,210
who grew up together,

835
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,050
is probably this.

836
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,870
When people grow up,

837
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,720
many things and relationships

838
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,460
will change.

839
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,300
There are also things that won't change.

840
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,780
Just because you don't want to change,

841
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,360
doesn't mean the reality hasn't changed.

842
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,030
Things change

843
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,990
because some things

844
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,870
never belonged to you

845
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,860
or me.

846
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,510
It's just that

847
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,670
we didn't know it in the past.

848
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,980
Yes.

849
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,070
You did change a lot.

850
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,760
But one thing remains the same.

851
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,730
Your appetite

852
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,110
is still the same

853
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,320
as before.

854
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,690
How can you eat so much?

855
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,170
Look at the pot calling the kettle black.

856
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,240
You ate eight scallion pancakes

857
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,390
from the stall outside the school every day.

858
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,170
That was because

859
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,300
when you were little,

860
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,660
you always booked the entire stall.

861
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,000
I had to seize the chance

862
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,790
to eat more when I could.

863
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,830
That scallion pancake was so good.

864
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,230
It was.

865
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,180
I miss it.

866
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,000
Doesn't Yang Jian make good scallion pancakes?
