00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,490
She...

197
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,240
She's abroad.

198
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,470
She's abroad.

199
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,750
Why did you point back there if she's abroad?

200
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,370
Do you think I'm stupid?

201
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,730
She just bought Teng Yue.

202
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,920
Hurry up and have Ms. Jiang come out.

203
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,300
It's true.

204
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,990
You came at a bad time.

205
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,410
She really went abroad.

206
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,120
You're not good at lying,

207
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,630
bro.

208
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,440
Come here.

209
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,610
Let me tell you.

210
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,430
she really went abroad.

211
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:13,830
You...

212
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,640
Hey—

213
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,030
Isn't she here?

214
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,220
I heard

215
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,990
you just spent five million

216
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,990
to buy Teng Yue.

217
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,080
That's right.

218
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,990
Okay.

219
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,230
Since you have money,

220
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,110
how about you

221
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,340
pay off our debt too?

222
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,470
I don't have money right now.

223
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,350
That doesn't sound right.

224
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,230
Why does the Jiang family

225
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,060
all go back on their words?

226
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,110
Back then, your dad also—

227
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,070
You have no right to mention my dad.

228
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,750
Ms. Jiang,

229
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,830
we always

230
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,700
try to be polite.

231
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:53,990
I've given you

232
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,190
enough respect and time.

233
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,920
Don't take my kindness for granted.

234
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,760
I said

235
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,550
I don't have money right now.

236
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
What do you want?

237
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,580
Go!

238
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,100
Are you trying to default on the debt?

239
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,110
Don't test me.

240
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,110
I have 100 ways

241
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,830
to make you regret this.

242
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,150
Boss,

243
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,510
come.

244
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,190
Listen.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,940
When you go in,

246
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,190
bite all of them,

247
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,020
other than Jiang Hu.

248
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,750
Bite them all.

249
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,190
Eat...

250
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,120
No,

251
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,870
you have high blood sugar.

252
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,030
Eating this will give you high blood sugar.

253
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,500
Go.

254
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,360
Go bite them.

255
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,870
Go.

256
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,810
I'm not trying to default on the debt.

257
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,410
It's that you're asking for money in the wrong way.

258
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,990
You're quite arrogant.

259
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,990
Bite, bite, bite.

260
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,490
Sit.

261
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,050
Everyone, sit.

262
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,590
Having you all stand while I sit

263
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,570
is not the way to treat guests.

264
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,990
Also, craning my neck

265
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,470
to look at you all

266
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,350
is too tiring.

267
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,310
Speak.

268
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,130
The creditor has the right to require the debtor

269
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,470
to follow the contract

270
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,830
or the law

271
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,590
to fulfill the obligation.

272
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,710
I don't understand these legal terms.

273
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,350
Who does Teng Yue owe money to?

274
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,470
I will pay

275
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,470
without missing a single cent.

276
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,690
Good.

277
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,970
Then, go get the money.

278
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,260
There's no hurry.

279
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,870
Are you playing with me?

280
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,130
According to the rules,

281
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,930
you have to show me the supply contract.

282
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,800
The purchase order

283
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,180
or credit terms are fine too.

284
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,110
You said that Teng Yue owes money,

285
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,450
so show me the evidence.

286
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,430
How much do we owe?

287
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,990
I'll pay you back

288
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,710
every cent.

289
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,350
Ms. Jiang,

290
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,350
are you kidding me?

291
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,960
Don't tell me you don't know

292
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,760
why they didn't sign a contract,

293
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,590
didn't want a purchase order

294
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,630
or credit IOU.

295
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,350
If it weren't for them being reasonable,

296
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,090
having a low price,

297
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,950
and being willing to let you get the goods first and pay later,

298
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,950
they'd never get this business.

299
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,530
You took advantage of them

300
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,830
and now,

301
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,710
you're asking them for evidence.

302
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,200
Is that moral?

303
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,640
Give me three days.

304
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,910
I need to check all the accounts.

305
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,030
Fine.

306
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,710
I'll give you three days.

307
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,900
Everyone,

308
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,089
the most shocking thing

309
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,079
is not that Free Unicorn's distributor

310
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,060
bought Free Unicorn.

311
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,440
Instead, it's that the former heiress of Free Unicorn

312
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,660
bought Teng Yue.

313
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,630
What is this for?

314
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,619
If you don't get it, then that's normal.

315
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,119
I'm confused too.

316
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,810
The daughter of Jiang Qisheng

317
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,230
gave up on inheriting Free Unicorn

318
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,770
in order to avoid inheriting

319
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,069
the huge debt.

320
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,260
I understand that.

321
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,589
But then, she spent all her money

322
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,630
and bought

323
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,109
the half-dead Teng Yue.

324
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,300
This is crazy.

325
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,470
Back then, I invested in TT Media

326
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,470
because Ms. Song

327
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,790
was your ex-girlfriend.

328
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,170
I didn't expect that you'd be

329
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,990
even stricter than me

330
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,480
as soon as you came into position.

331
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,710
You're so unbiased.

332
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,230
How about this?

333
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,990
I'll quickly draft

334
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,060
an ex-girlfriend list.

335
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,800
Hope you can generously empty your wallet for them.

336
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,710
I'm just...

337
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,240
I was just kidding.

338
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,710
Anyway, Ms. Song

339
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,790
indeed found the right person.

340
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,950
Do you have

341
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,440
other livestream resources?

342
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,540
Only good post-investment service

343
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,870
can increase

344
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,110
the success rate of quitting.

345
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,740
But I didn't expect it.

346
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,160
Didn't expect what?

347
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:21,870
I didn't expect

348
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,550
that Ms. Jiang's speed of ruining herself

349
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,150
is surprisingly fast.

350
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,430
She could've done anything with that money.

351
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,910
She could even start from scratch

352
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,140
and open another shoe factory.

353
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,000
Rationality is the basic requirement

354
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,270
for investors.

355
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,910
The reality is

356
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,550
that she no longer has an advantage,

357
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,220
while her rationality

358
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,550
is still where it was

359
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,650
before Jiang Qisheng died.

360
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,370
What do you mean?

361
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,940
She's gone mad.

362
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,450
You didn't consider

363
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,240
reality at all

364
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,630
for your actions.

365
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,490
You can't even protect yourself

366
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,390
right now.

367
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,700
Why are you caring so much about them?

368
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,150
Anyway,

369
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,360
they don't have that contract anyway.

370
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,870
Right?

371
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,440
Even the court

372
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,910
and police can't do anything to you.

373
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,850
What can they do?

374
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,080
At most,

375
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,400
they'll just vent their anger.

376
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,950
Take some paint

377
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,250
and pour it here.

378
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,130
What are you afraid of?

379
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,220
Uncle,

380
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,180
just follow my instructions

381
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,480
and check the accounts.

382
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,990
Just ignore them.

383
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,710
I'm telling you to ignore them,

384
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,710
so just ignore them, okay?

385
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,380
I told you.

386
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
Let's do it.

387
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,950
Okay.

388
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,900
I'll listen to you.

389
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,160
I'm not your dad.

390
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,170
I can't control you.

391
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,230
Fine.

392
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,490
I need to find Yue Shan

393
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,230
and finish

394
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,430
the rest of the paperwork.

395
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,930
As for the money...

396
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,910
I, I...

397
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,970
I don't have any.

398
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,730
I've put them all into the stock market.

399
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm not asking you for money.

400
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,590
That's good.

401
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,380
I'm terrified when talking about money.

402
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,670
Uncle,

403
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,120
you’re Teng Yue's factory director.

404
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,790
You make me speechless.

405
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,600
Find some time in the coming days

406
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,060
to find a factory

407
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,440
with a suitable price and location.

408
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,710
I'll figure out the money matter.

409
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,310
Alright.

410
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,200
You don't need me anymore.

411
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,440
That's all.

412
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,580
I'm leaving.

413
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,360
We're at the bottom already.

414
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,780
Why are you still looking for a factory?

415
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,230
A factory for what?

416
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,350
After paying

417
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,740
for the bid for Teng Yue,

418
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,650
your account

419
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,430
only has 6,730 yuan left.

420
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,020
Don't you think

421
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,170
your action was too impulsive?

422
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,950
I already did it.

423
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,930
I got the text too,

424
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,870
so you don't have to remind me

425
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,400
what these four numbers are.

426
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,120
Your sports car has been towed away.

427
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,440
The house you live in now

428
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,430
has to be emptied

429
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,990
in three days too.

430
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,540
I know that too.

431
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,820
Move in with me.

432
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,890
We can take care of each other.

433
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,230
No need.

434
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,600
I have a place to stay.

435
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,950
Use this card

436
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,620
for now.

437
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,880
It can be emergency aid.

438
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,380
Take it.

439
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,290
If your dad knew about

440
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,330
your current situation,

441
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,090
he'd be sad.

442
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,590
Why are you so stubborn?

443
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,270
Ms. Yue,

444
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,880
my dad has already passed away.

445
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,800
You don't have to pretend

446
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,230
to be so kind to me anymore.

447
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,870
I know you don't like me.

448
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,190
How would you feel

449
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,270
if someone kept wanting

450
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,490
to be your stepmom?

451
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,110
I'm not the third party

452
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,610
and I didn't destroy your family.

453
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,950
That doesn't mean

454
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,950
that I have to accept

455
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,490
every woman who has feelings for my dad.

456
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,540
You have done your part

457
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,400
for Free Unicorn and my dad.

458
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,810
You've done your job.

459
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,670
I'll take care of Teng Yue

460
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,780
by myself.

461
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,710
Wait.

462
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,280
Take the card.

463
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,300
Mr. Xu.

464
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,650
Baoxing

465
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,920
has given us a lot of support.

466
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,390
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

467
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,790
We will try our best

468
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,100
to reach the goal for user growth.

469
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,450
Okay?

470
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,960
No problem.

471
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,030
I'll wait for your proposal.

472
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,650
See you next time.

473
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,510
Okay.

474
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,720
Liu, see everyone off.

475
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,470
Okay, Mr. Xu.

476
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,230
This way, please.
Thank you.

477
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,710
You joined Baoxing?

478
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,120
The land under Teng Yue

479
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,900
is yours now.

480
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,880
Since we've met,

481
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,660
then let's make things clear

482
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,390
between the two of us.

483
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,350
It will save our time effectively.

484
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,310
Speak.

485
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,730
How many days will you give me?

486
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,290
I'll move.

487
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,270
Internally, we planned for

488
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,870
before the end of the month.

489
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,650
Okay, I got it.

490
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,790
Get in.

491
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,610
Let me give you a ride.

492
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,510
No need.

493
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,110
It's hard for you to get a taxi at this hour.

494
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,230
It's okay.

495
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,360
I have time.

496
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,920
What you're wasting now

497
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,220
is not only your time,

498
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,510
but also mine.

499
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,470
Huazhou Junting neighborhood, thank you.

500
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,930
You're really treating me as your driver.

501
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,080
Please fasten your seat belt.

502
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,070
We'll depart right away.

503
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,920
You were fired by Aneda,

504
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,440
right?

505
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,550
Tang Ya is truly

506
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,490
a cold-blooded demoness.

507
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,150
I've seen your designs

508
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,150
and also

509
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,310
your videos on Weibo.

510
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,200
You really like designing

511
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,140
and your usage of traditional elements

512
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,390
is very creative.

513
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,980
However, your agreement with Aneda

514
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,760
is in the way.

515
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,530
Other companies in the industry can't hire you.

516
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,970
Then why did you ask me to come here?

517
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,040
We are all designers, right?

518
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,230
This is an independent studio.

519
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,790
For designs, we pay per piece.

520
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,780
So, what you mean is

521
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,650
you want me to do private work

522
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,840
with your studio.

523
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:24,990
Smart.

524
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,230
As long as your designs

525
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,370
are credited with my name,

526
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,950
Aneda won't be able to

527
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,690
point out anything wrong.

528
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,990
What do you think?

529
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,860
Hello?

530
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,540
I do.

531
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,390
Sorry.

532
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,040
You're really asking the wrong person.

533
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,010
I won't take private work for anyone,

534
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,160
or be anyone's ghost designer.

535
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,550
Xiang Zhaoyang,

536
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,990
you can do it.

537
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,770
We have arrived at your destination.

538
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,810
Please take your belongings

539
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,950
and get ready to get off.

Thank you, miss.

547
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,760
Remember to give me a five-star review.

548
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,790
You're back?

549
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,390
Why are you here?

550
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,400
I...

551
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,390
What's wrong?

552
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,320
I can't come today?

553
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:05,810
Mom.

554
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,110
You've been back for so many days.

555
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,570
[Factory director of an old cup brand, Fang Moping]

556
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,520
Why haven't you come home?

557
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,200
He definitely wanted to come home.

558
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,670
I told him

559
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,100
to arrange his work schedule

560
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,020
and clean up the house

561
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,960
before coming to visit you.

562
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,000
This way, you can rest assured.

563
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,350
Go wash your hands.

564
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,020
Get ready for dinner.

565
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,710
I'll go up to get changed.

566
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,900
You spoil him.

567
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,520
I'm his aunt

568
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,760
and I don't have a child.

569
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,790
Besides,

his dad and his uncle are both gone.

571
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,930
He's the only one in the Xu family.

572
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,140
Who else can I dote on?

573
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,400
Okay,

574
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,440
tell the young master to come eat.

575
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,580
Sure.

576
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,680

taking your parents' connections

for your own use.

583

Mom,

584
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,830
that's not the professional way to put it.

585

What I'm doing

586
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,950
is called the disposal of non-performing assets.

587
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,950
I don't care if they're performing assets

588
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,910

What is this?

594
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,940
That must be a genetic mutation then.

595
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,910
-Moping, have some vegetables.
-I’ve looked into Baoxing.

Tell me,

00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,340
how did we create

605

about being opportunistic.

607

has to feel guilty about it?

609
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,310
It's not wise

610
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,710
to pass up the era's advantages.

611
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:11,710
Sophistry.

00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,840
See Mr. Fang off.

771
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,310
Hurry up.

772
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,570
Ridiculous.

773
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Fang.

774
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,190
I'm really sorry.

775
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,760
Please don't take this to heart.

776
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:19,790
Take care.

777
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,200
What's wrong with you?

778
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,010
You...

779
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,370
I'm going to lose my job

780
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,740
if you treat my client like this.

781
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,590
His entire body

782
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,140
was almost pressed onto my back.

783
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,450
Do you know how many people

784
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,720
are fighting to work with Qiandai?

785
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,910
Do you understand?

786
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,370
Your value will only skyrocket

787
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,650
if you can get the biggest brands.

788
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,980
In this business,

789
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,240
you can only get traffic

790
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,390
by selling big brands.

791
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,260
Only with traffic can you have high status.

792
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,430
Get to work.

793
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,080
His logic was flawed.

794
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,620
What?

795
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,960
Needing big brands to have traffic

796
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,250
is the biggest logical flaw.

797
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,940
Of course, in real life,

798
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,400
there are many such cases.

799
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,190
Do you still want to continue this job?

800
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,570
For me, this job

801
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,330
can quickly solve

802
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,090
my financial problems.

803
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,720
Turning yourself

804
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,350
into someone

805
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,730
who doesn't need to be controlled by others

806
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,800
can solve

807
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,110
your financial problems in the long-term.

808
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,640
What do you mean?

809
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,070
You have to

810
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,140
have big support behind you.

811
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,510
This way,

812
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,820
you won't be bullied so easily.

813
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,770
Big support?

814
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,500
What do you mean?

815
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,500
If you want to

816
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,720
continue this job,

817
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,360
you can come find me

818
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,390
at the address on the business card.

819
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,330
What just happened

820
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,430
will never happen

821
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,350
in my place.

822
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,770
This is my first promise

823
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,570
to you.

824
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,850
Xu Si?
