00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,070
Hello, Jiu.

6
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,040
Work overtime tonight.

7
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,670
Okay.

8
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,100
Why didn't you ask what it's about?

9
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,270
If it weren't urgent,

10
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,110
you wouldn't have called me

11
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,830
in the middle of the night.

12
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,230
You sure are my buddy.

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,640
My car is with Qi.

14
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,510
Later, drive my car

15
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,230
and arrive at Zhaoyang's place

16
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,340
in 30 minutes.

17
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,270
I'll wait for you here.

18
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,290
By the way,

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,270
bring me some clothes.

20
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,550
Okay.

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,030
What's wrong with you?

22
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,540
Why

23
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,400
are you dressed like this?

24
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,900
What's up?

25
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,100
It smells good.

26
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,829
Stop it.

27
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,390
Are you really with Zhaoyang...

28
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,750
Get your mind out of the gutter!

29
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,980
Really?

30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,700
Start driving.

31
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,370
Cut the crap.

32
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,730
What are we doing?

33
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,190
Let's go

34
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:01,830
find someone.

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,110
Okay.

36
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,990
Coming.

37
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,620
Jiang Hu?

38
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,710
Let's have a chat.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,310
It won't take long.

40
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,070
That's decent.

41
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,390
Your...

42
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,100
Well...

43
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,120
how much is the rent per year?

44
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,230
200,000.

45
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,260
200,000, right?

46
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:41,680
That's decent.

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,790
It's a stable income.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,270
It's very stable.

49
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,710
It's great.

50
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,790
Just do your best.

51
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,230
Is it sweet?

52
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,230
Yes.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,590
Do think this is fengli or boluo pineapple?

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,180
This is fengli pineapple.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,370
It's a new species here.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,110
For this fengli pineapple,

57
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,070
is your profit greater

58
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,990
when you

59
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,270
sell them cut up or whole?

60
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,400
Cut up, of course.

61
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,490
Cut up?

62
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,300
Okay.

63
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,150
Jiu.

64
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,380
Long time no see.

65
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,440
You don't remember me?

66
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,200
Who are you?

67
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,230
Two days ago,

68
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,800
we were even drinking together.

69
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,790
Really?

70
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,320
You got drunk after two drinks.

71
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,680
Who sent you home?

72
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,350
I don't recall that.

73
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,210
Why are you still...

74
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,130
Do you remember him?

75
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh my goodness.

76
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,700
Wait.

77
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,590
Wait.

78
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,370
What do you two want?

79
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,000
What did you do last night?

80
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,430
Speak up.

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,830
The surveillance camera

82
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,050
has recorded everything.

83
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,260
Are you two thugs hired by that influencer?

84
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,130
Cut the crap.

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Why did you follow her?

86
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,830
Nothing.

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,490
I just wanted to scold the influencer.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
You wanted to scold her?

89
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,400
I want to hit someone today...

90
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,550
I...

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,350
Wait.

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,170
I lost 300,000 yuan.

93
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,790
Isn't this a trap set up by

94
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,030
that influencer and that finance company

95
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,670
to squeeze us dry?

96
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,710
Listen.

97
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,290
This is called fraud.

98
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,320
Fraud!

99
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,350
Jiu.

100
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

101
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,990
You should look for the boss

102
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,350
of the company you bought the stocks from.

103
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,500
How am I talking nonsense?

104
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,160
Here.

105
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,460
Take a look.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,120
The news is all over the internet.

107
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,490
Look for yourselves.

108
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,430
This darn influencer's

109
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:44,650
[Behind any glory lies the perils that lurk everywhere. 
The same applies to Shangchun Art Project.]

110
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:44,650
[The market is getting bigger, the management can’t keep up, 
and investors have ulterior motives, so there’s a crisis.]

111
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,230
boyfriend

112
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,040
is the president of Baoxing Investment.

113
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,470
Some time ago,

114
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,490
that was revealed on the Internet.

115
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,940
Isn't this evidence?

116
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,670
They worked together on these

117
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,230
influencer concept stocks.

118
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,590
She cheated me of over 300,000 yuan.

119
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,090
Can't I scold her?

120
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,610
If you want to scold someone, go to Shangchun Art Project

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,040
or Baoxing Investment.

122
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,350
She’s a jinx!

123
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,130
Don't let me see you following her again.

124
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,230
I remember your face.

125
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,470
I also know where you live.

126
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,960
This is the next marketing plan

127
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,750
of Teng Yue.

128
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,450
Take a look.

129
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,110
You've reached a consensus?

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,350
I remember that in our last conversation,

131
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,150
I didn't agree to terminate the contract with Zhaoyang

132
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,970
nor did I agree to cooperate with you.

133
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,710
Over the past two days, I've evaluated

134
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,230
TT Media's current situation.

135
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,270
This cooperation

136
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,000
can help you resolve

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
your current problem.

138
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,470
Jiang Hu.

139
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,360
Do you like to

140
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,710
make decisions all by yourself?

141
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,580
Before the economic scandal

142
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,030
of Shangchun Art Project and TT Media

143
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,770
reaches an irreversible stage,

144
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,710
we still have

145
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,390
48 hours

146
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,390
to prepare.

147
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,230
For a cooperation that hasn't been executed

148
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,350
and of which the results are unguaranteed,

149
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,220
you want me to

150
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,270
nullify the termination fee

151
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,500
and terminate my contract with Zhaoyang?

152
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,290
Jiang Hu.

153
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,390
You can't talk business like this.

154
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,850
Ms. Song.

155
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,030
Please take a closer look

156
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,120
at the terms of our agreement.

157
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,990
It's not that

158
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,590
the termination fee wouldn't be paid,

159
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,110
but that it'd be paid in a different way

160
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,350
in instalments.

161
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
50% commission

162
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,670
of Teng Yue's sales?

163
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,030
Zhaoyang's current business quotation

164
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,110
is 30% of the sales.

165
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,590
I can't see your sincerity

166
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,350
in this proposal of 50%.

167
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,270
Firstly,

168
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,270
you haven't given Zhaoyang

169
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,830
any livestream sales jobs.

170
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,520
So,

171
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,280
30% of the sales

172
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,310
is just a sample price.

173
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,350
Secondly,

174
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,590
after the matter with

175
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,590
Shangchun Art Project,

176
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,590
would there be any clients

177
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,790
who'd offer 30%

178
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,590
for Zhaoyang's livestream sales?

179
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,990
On this matter, I think

180
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,350
you have a better understanding than me.

181
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,830
It's pointless to say that.

182
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,150
We can implement

183
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,550
the PR crisis management ourselves.

184
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,470
You don't have to

185
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,230
worry about what will happen next.

186
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,180
I've already implemented

187
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,210
the PR crisis management for you.

188
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,030
Are you really going to do this?

189
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,350
In this way,

190
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,670
you have to bear a lot of responsibilities.

191
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,670
I believe

192
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,250
that after this plan is carried out,

193
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,730
it will be a win-win situation for us.

194
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,870
Actually, Xiang Zhaoyang

195
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,310
is not my only choice.

196
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,430
She's not the only

197
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,680
suitable designer.

198
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,900
But it's inefficient

199
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,510
to waste time on meaningless

200
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,830
back-and-forth discussions.

201
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,510
I don't want to do that.

202
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,850
I believe you don't want to either.

203
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,470
Besides,

204
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,110
if you didn't want

205
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,870
this discussion,

206
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,750
you wouldn't have

207
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,059
passed on message to me through Xu Si,

208
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,990
right?

209
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,430
I think I understand

210
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,190
why Xu Si

211
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,630
treats you differently.

212
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,890
To achieve

213
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,350
your business goal,

214
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,750
you made your boyfriend

215
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,310
negotiate with his ex-girlfriend.

216
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,190
Not everyone

217
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,230
can do such a thing.

218
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,170
Xu Si is not my boyfriend.

219
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,430
You even want to buy

220
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,440
the design copyright of Flowing Scenery

221
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,430
from Aneda?

222
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,830
No designer has managed

223
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,310
to extract the elements of traditional Chinese painting

224
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,310
in terms of color

225
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,990
and lines

226
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,440
and use them on domestically-produced canvas shoes.

227
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,630
From the first time

228
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,600
I saw this design,

229
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,070
I wanted to use it for Teng Yue.

230
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,120
But the problem now is

231
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,640
if Aneda will agree.

232
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,630
I’ve talked to them.

233
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,790
Ms. Jiang.

234
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,100
Your request is indeed out of line.

235
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,400
This is the first time someone

236
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,230
wants to buy

237
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,350
the artwork copyright

238
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,830
of our company's designer.

239
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,310
Former designer.

240
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,020
Yes.

241
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,990
Former designer.

242
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,410
Aneda's design team

243
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,560
is huge.

244
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,190
But every season's products

245
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,590
are based on their functionality

246
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,390
and design theme,

247
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,800
and have a clear and unified style.

248
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,660
Since Zhaoyang joined the company,

249
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,230
her Chinese-style design style

250
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,720
has not been

251
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,940
congruent with Aneda's product style.

252
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,070
So,

253
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,470
although Aneda sent her

254
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,480
to the competition,

255
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,070
no matter before

256
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,340
or after the competition,

257
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,990
she's never led a design that's been put into production

258
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,440
during her time here.

259
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,510
I didn't expect you

260
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,710
to know so much

261
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,590
about Aneda's

262
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,710
R&D situation.

263
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,990
So,

264
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,330
I'm here to make

265
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,230
this presumptuous request today.

266
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,710
This is a special request,

267
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,530
but it's not presumptuous.

268
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,360
What you said just now

269
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,450
somewhat convinced me.

270
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,600
I'll talk to Xiang Zhaoyang's

271
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,710
former design director

272
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,910
about this.

273
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,830
Then I'll give you

274
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,020
a satisfactory answer.

275
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,750
Right now, Aneda only releases

276
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,620
four basic designs for their canvas shoes every year.

277
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,110
Their main focus in terms of their direction

278
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,200
and the research

279
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,750
is still at

280
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,110
the mid-range running shoes

281
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,230
that cost between 300 to 500.

282
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,200
I don't think

283
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,250
their supply chain would put into production

284
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,770
a design by a resigned designer

285
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,870
and of which cannot be

286
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,750
serialized.

287
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,380
It's still risky.

288
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,580
Have you thought it through?

289
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,510
Yes.

290
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,430
Have a seat.

291
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,880
Which floor are you two going to?

292
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,510
Which floor are you two going to?

293
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,230
Come and register.

294
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,190
Go, go, go.

295
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,710
Don't jump the turnstile!

296
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,070
Come over here.

297
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,120
Come over here. Listen to me.

298
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,710
Listen to me.

299
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,710
He's a family member of the boss.

300
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,590
He needs to use the restroom and can't hold it in anymore...

301
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,190
Even if he's family,

302
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,000
he still has to tell me which floor he's going to.

303
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Wait a minute.

304
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,830
Haven't you seen him before?

305
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,960
Really?

306
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:10,930
He's really going to use the restroom.

307
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,940
It's fine.

308
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,350
Although you cancelled

309
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,090
Teng Yue's KPI review,

310
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,830
if

311
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,080
I didn't make this choice,

312
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,510
I'm afraid I can't even guarantee

313
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,600
the year-end total.

314
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,630
Teng Yue needs to take the risk this time.

315
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,830
You've talked a lot.

316
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,830
Have some water first.

317
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,200
Did Xiang Zhaoyang agree?

318
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,760
Yang?

319
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,910
Why are you here?

320
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,540
What are you doing?

321
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,110
Come here!

322
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,430
Come here!

323
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,350
What are you doing?

324
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,380
Jiang Hu, get out of the way.

325
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,150
Get out of the way!

326
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,170
What's wrong?

327
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160
Are you crazy?

328
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,830
Let go of me!

329
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,990
Come here.

330
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,820
Are you crazy?

331
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,350
Move.

332
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,870
Come here.

333
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,430
Move!

334
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,910
Call the police!

335
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,530
What are you looking at?

336
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,110
Get out of my way!

337
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,110
Don't call the police!

338
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,630
It's because of this bastard...

339
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,470
There must be a misunderstanding!

340
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,310
that someone followed and took revenge

341
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,830
on Zhaoyang!

342
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,830
Step aside, Jiang Hu.

343
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,470
I knew

344
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,230
you're not a good person.

345
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,630
Come here!

346
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,710
Come.

347
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,390
Come in.

348
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,710
Come in.

349
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,640
Well, I won't come in.

350
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,070
Have a good rest.

351
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,450
Why does it hurt again?

352
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,790
I'm thirsty.

353
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,190
I want some water.

354
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Get me some water.

355
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
This is just an external injury,

356
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,190
where you have swelling

357
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,120
due to changes in the facial muscle tissues.

358
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,650
Your limbs are fine.

359
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,470
I'm injured to this extent.

360
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,710
Why can't you get me a glass of water?

361
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,990
I don't know

362
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,380
where the water in your home is.

363
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,500
There are blisters in my mouth.

364
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,350
I can't drink it.

365
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,740
Have a seat.

366
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,550
How dare I?

367
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,380
Young Master, do you have any other orders?

368
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,640
Get it straight.

369
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,710
Your work partner

370
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,100
beat me up.

371
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,830
Why are you so reluctant

372
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,100
to even help me out a little?

373
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,830
I'm not reluctant.

374
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,590
Didn't I explain it just now?

375
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,360
It's a misunderstanding.

376
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,380
Yang thought you set this up

377
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,470
and involved Xiang Chaoyang

378
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,020
in Shangchun Art Project's stocks situation.

379
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,040
Yang is Xiang Zhaoyang's brother.

380
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,470
He did it in the heat of the moment.

381
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,570
It's understandable.

382
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,630
In the heat of the moment?

383
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,710
Is hitting someone allowed

384
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,970
just because it's in the heat of the moment?

385
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,870
I can guarantee

386
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,630
that in the future,

387
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,970
he won't do anything to you anymore.

388
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,530
What's your relationship with him?

389
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,790
How can you be so sure to vouch for him?

390
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,980
He's a work partner.

391
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,070
Didn't you

392
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,070
explain my relationship with him

393
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,040
yourself just now?

394
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,870
Are work partners

395
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,310
so close?

396
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,310
Don't think I don't know

397
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,240
that just now,

398
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,480
not only did you stop me from teaching him a lesson,

399
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,500
but you also stopped them from calling the police.

400
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,570
Xu Si.

401
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,110
I don't want to

402
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,360
argue pettily with you

403
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,820
in such a high-end house.

404
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm leaving.

405
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,990
Wait.

406
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,710
What now?

407
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,620
Promise me one thing before you leave.

408
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,670
Okay.

409
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,830
What is it?

410
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,110
Don't go.

411
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,560
The interior design of your house is quite special.

412
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,870
It suits

413
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,760
your cold temperament.

414
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,900
Very stylish,

415
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
simple and functional.

416
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,050
Not bad.

417
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,000
What did you say?

418
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,030
I said your house's interior design

419
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,200
is simple and functional.

420
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,150
Before that.

421
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,830
It's very stylish.

422
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,560
Before that.

423
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
It suits your temperament.

424
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,870
Say the whole thing again.

425
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,350
It suits your cold...

426
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,070
So,

427
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,230
my image in your mind

428
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,900
is like this.

429
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,220
Then tell me,

430
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
how should I change

431
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,470
your understanding of me?

432
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,750
I-I was wrong.

433
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,870
I didn't mean that.

434
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,470
It's too late to explain now.

435
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,670
It's not.

436
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,070
You're such a profoundly well-learned

437
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,840
and exceptionally talented person.

438
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,840
How could it be too late?

439
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,180
I'm hungry.

440
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,930
What are you doing?

441
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,280
Ordering takeout.

442
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,020
Why do you have to

443
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,260
go to the kitchen to order takeout?

444
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,260
Are you looking for inspiration?

445
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,670
If you're taking care of a patient,

446
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,550
shouldn't you cook yourself?

447
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,870
My young master,

448
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,230
you overestimated me.

449
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,470
I can't cook.

450
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,870
How about porridge?

451
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,990
No.

452
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,040
Slow-roasted Australian steak with grains and rice.

453
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,470
High in protein and fiber.

454
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,140
Okay?

455
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,290
Okay.

456
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,800
I've ordered it.

457
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,620
No objections.

458
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,090
Can I leave now?

459
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,580
Are you in such a hurry to leave?

460
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,470
Yang is still waiting downstairs.

461
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,790
Him again?

462
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,980
Are you trying to piss me off?

463
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,790
If...

464
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,850
I mean if.

465
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,630
If you are still angry,

466
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,150
how about this?

467
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,930
On behalf of Yang,

468
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,850
I solemnly apologize to you once again.

469
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,710
Will that do?

470
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,790
You are you, and he is him.

471
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,340
He already apologized to me

472
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,440
in the company just now.

473
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,760
You don't have to thank me for him.

474
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,430
What do you want then?

475
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,940
Before my face can be seen in public,

476
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,540
you'll be responsible for my dinner everyday.

477
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,590
Are you blackmailing me?

478
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,110
It's not too late to call the police now.

479
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,640
Don't.

480
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,230
Don't.

481
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,520
Dinner, right?

482
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,460
Okay.

483
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,440
Okay.

484
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,470
Okay.

485
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,440
You may leave.

486
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,520
Oh, right.

487
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,300
What now?

488
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,150
With my current injury,

489
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,150
I don't think I can attend

490
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,210
tomorrow's press conference.

491
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,920
You can take charge and handle the good and the bad.

492
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,930
But Xiang Zhaoyang

493
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,360
hasn't given you a clear answer yet.

494
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,140
I'm confident

495
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,510
she'll agree to it.

496
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,940
What a nuisance.

497
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,050
Zhaoyang.

498
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,160
How is our factory?

499
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,270
Wu.

500
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:07,880
You make it sound like

501
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,190
you're from the factory.

502
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,370
I'm the manager of the flagship store.

503
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:14,990
To be honest,

504
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,480
working under the boss all these years,

505
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,070
I've gotten acquainted

506
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,160
with a lot of people.

507
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,600
Some run factories

508
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,530
and some run stores.

509
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,380
Compared to them,

510
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,450
Jiang Hu is still a novice.

511
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,390
Many things she does and methods she uses

512
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,150
are quite amateurish.

513
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,150
But she has a great sense of responsibility

514
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,230
with what she does.

515
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,790
It's not easy

516
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,030
for one person to manage and maintain

517
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,210
the factory like this.

518
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,790
Master Zhang.

519
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,860
What are you busy with?

520
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,080
A few posters.

521
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,310
Ms. Jiang

522
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,490
designed these herself.

523
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,070
The printing factory just sent it here.

524
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,910
I have to adjust it.

525
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,070
By the way,

526
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,120
let me introduce her to you.

527
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,170
This is Zhaoyang.

528
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,800
She's a shoe designer.

529
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,990
She's very famous.

530
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,860
Hello.

531
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,390
Hello.

532
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,170
I heard about you from Ms. Jiang.

533
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,430
You even won an award, right?

534
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,470
Nice, very lucky.

535
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,400
You're young and promising.

536
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,150
Thank you.

537
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,370
Master Zhang Sheng

538
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,680
is the deputy director of our factory.

539
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,240
His skills are formidable.

540
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,830
He's

541
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,120
even the master of making shoe lasts.

542
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,830
All the products of Free Unicorn

543
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,480
are made with his shoe lasts.

544
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,020
It suits China best.

545
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,800
[Only by trusting each other can we help
complete the work and complete the dream!]

546
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,260
It's the shoe last

547
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
with the best fit for Asian feet.

548
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,280
Mr. Du, Hua Wenhai,

549
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,090
Cao Jing,

550
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,420
and Thomas are here.

551
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,530
It's not easy for you.

552
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,720
You're already injured

553
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,080
but you're still cleaning up others' mess.

554
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,150
Talking too much is a disease.

555
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,880
It has to be treated.

556
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,660
This is Song Zhi's termination contract.

557
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,470
It has been stamped with

558
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,480
the official seal of TT Media.

559
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,260
You just have to sign it.

560
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,600
How did you do that?

561
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,230
I just

562
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,000
talked business and negotiated with TT Media

563
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,910
and got the deal.

564
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,160
About your non-compete agreement with Aneda,

565
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,740
I've consulted a lawyer.

566
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,220
The termination fee is 200,000 yuan.

567
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,070
Teng Yue

568
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,250
will pay for this.

569
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,140
What do you think?

570
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,190
You didn't discuss

571
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,420
all this with me beforehand.

572
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,610
Why are you so sure

573
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,990
that I will choose Teng Yue?

574
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,100
I remember

575
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,710
that when you were little,

576
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,360
you liked to wear Teng Yue's shoes

577
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,910

581
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,470

We are not young anymore.

Isn't it too childish

585
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,760
to use this kind of emotional trick?

586
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,610
I even talked to Tang Ya

about the design copyright

the stock price became volatile

A few days ago,

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,440

648

00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,030

655
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,120
They

656
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,160
also agreed to cooperate with Teng Yue

657
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,150
because Mr. Xu went to

658
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,010
persuade them personally.

659
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,230

660
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,350
Why?

00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,240
Do you think Mr. Xu

662
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,150

663
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,940
has a sour face and a sharp tongue?

664

665
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,620

Hello, everyone.

674
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm Teng Yue's Jiang Hu.

675
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,240
I'll explain it simply.

676
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,230
Shangchun Art Project's stock price has been volatile lately

677
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,280
mainly because

678
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,320
of their strategic cooperation

679
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,280
with the influencer Zhaoyang

680
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:39,750
to join

681
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,330
the bandwagon of the currently popular

682
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,440
influencer concept stocks in the market.

683
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,530
It reached the limit up five times along the way

684
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,780
and created a market value of 1.5 billion.

685
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,480
There were crazy rumors

686
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,550
that the shareholders cashed out nearly 100 million.

687
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,010
Later, many people criticized influencers,

688
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,770
insinuating that several influencer concept stocks

689
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,120
are taking turns to heat up the market

690
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,470
and the finance companies are fraudulently profiting from it.

691
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,260
Actually,

692
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,660
Shangchun Art Project's situation

693
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,470
is not like that.

694
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,100
So,

695
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,630
this PR strategy is

696
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,030
to prove to the market that

697
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,510
Shangchun Art Project's

698
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,140
collaboration with the influencer Zhaoyang

699
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,910
was a form of

700
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,710
event marketing

701
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,350
to help the outdated national brand Teng Yue

702
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,120
re-enter the market.

703
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,250
Teng Yue is starting again

704
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,510
and is in a transformation period.

705
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,050
The quality control is unstable,

706
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,390
which affected

707
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,990
the rise and fall of their partner's stock price.

708
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,840
Then isn't she putting all the responsibilities

709
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,980
on herself to prove the innocence

710
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,360
of her partner?

711
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,860
This is such a stupid idea that pushes her

712
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,600
to the brink of death.

713
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,620
Who came up with it?

714
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,010
Jiang Hu.

715
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,230
She sure is the daughter of Jiang Qisheng.

716
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,470
Not only is she cruel to the market,

717
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,840
but also to herself.

718
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,970
She's crueler than you.

719
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,940
This time,

720
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,160
Teng Yue's market attention

721
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,630
and traffic

722
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,550
have skyrocketed.

723
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,290
That's because

724
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,750
you strategized behind the scenes

725
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,800
to deal with

726
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,150
Mr. Hua and his wife.

727
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,710
In the two years of the merger,

728
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,160
your time in the secondary market didn't go to waste.

729
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,650
You have a lot of connections.

730
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,790
Whether Teng Yue can be revived

731
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,380
still depends on

732
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,570
Xiang Zhaoyang's design skills.

733
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:16,990
Yes.

734
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,360
I didn't expect

735
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,870
Jiang Hu to think so highly of her

736
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,970
and spend so much effort

737
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,980
to come up with

738
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,470
such a grand plan for her alone.

739
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,810
This is the courage

740
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,030
a founder should have.

741
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,230
Is Xiang Zhaoyang at the scene?

742
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,210
She is the core of this plan.

743
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,330
If she's not there,

744
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,840
the press conference

745
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,050
will not be convincing.

746
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,990
Sorry,

747
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
the subscriber you dialed...

748
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,000
What's going on?

749
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,070
Did you find her?

750
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,230
At the end, we need her to go on stage and draw

751
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,750
the joint logo

752
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,070
of Shangchun Art Project and Teng Yue.

753
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,700
Where is she?

754
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,880
She's not answering my calls.

755
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,650
Could it be that Jiang Hu

756
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,960
failed to convince her?

757
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,490
Jiang Hu told me that if I can't find her,

758
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,280
I should call Yang Jian.

759
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,180
Hurry and call him now.

760
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,420
I've looked around

761
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,670
at her home and anywhere else

762
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,640
that she might have gone to.

763
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,990
She went out early in the morning.

764
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,310
I really don't know where she went.

765
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,350
Okay, I'll keep looking.

766
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,330
Today,

767
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,270
Ms. Zhaoyang also came to the scene.

768
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,580
But she isn't here

769
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,370
as a top influencer,

770
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,550
but

771
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,560
as the awardee of the Silver Award at St. Laurent Design Competition

772
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,020
and Teng Yue's designer.

773
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,550
She'll be drawing

774
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,850
Shangchun Art Project and Teng Yue's joint logo

775
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,130
at the scene.

776
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,230
Next, let's welcome Xiang Zhaoyang.

777
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,380
Great.

778
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,720
This is...

779
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,150
Where is she?

780
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,110
She's here.

781
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,430
What...

782
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,550
What's going on?

783
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,780
It's her.

784
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,580
It's really her.

785
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,470
Let's give a big round of applause

786
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,230
to welcome Xiang Zhaoyang!

787
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,380
[Teng Yue Shoes]

788
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,449
How is it?

789
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,510
Isn't the view nice?

790
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,300
Yes.

791
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,500
I never thought

792
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,020
we'd be working together.

793
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,780
Neither have I.

794
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,810
In the past,

795
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,190
you rarely

796
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,170
wore canvas shoes.

797
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,300
Yes.

798
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:57,310
In this period,

799
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,920
the duration I've been wearing canvas shoes is greater than

800
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,390
the total duration I've worn canvas shoes throughout my life.

801
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,500
So why is that?

802
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,170
The Jiang Hu wearing canvas shoes

803
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,960
is actually now

804
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,190
in the same boat as me.

805
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,240
Xiang Zhaoyang.

806
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,200
I remember that since you were little,

807
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,430
you liked drawing canvas shoes.

808
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,040
Over the years, you must have drawn

809
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,310
no less than 100 pairs of canvas shoes.

810
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,360
I really didn't understand

811
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,470
why you liked drawing canvas shoes

812
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,320
that much.

813
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,620
Jiang Hu, you should know

814
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,910
that people are not born equal.

815
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,120
There are people like you

816
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,760
who only wear

817
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,510
designer shoes all your life,

818
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,500
and then there are people like me

819
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,670
who only wear canvas shoes

820
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,940
my whole life.

821
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,890
But we are all the same.

822
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,310
Everyone

823
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,410
wants the shoes on their feet

824
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,910
to be more comfortable

825
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,860
and more beautiful.

826
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,810
If it can't be more comfortable,

827
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,890
it should at least be more beautiful.

828
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,640
I understand this logic.

829
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,290
No.

830
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,050
I should say that it's getting clearer and clearer to me.

831
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,670
Let me put it this way.

832
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,010
Ordinary people have to walk an average of

833
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,140
7,500 steps per day.

834
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,550
In a lifetime,

835
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,030
it'll be 274 million steps.

836
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,920
My parents' business

837
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,610
started from satisfying

838
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,010
the needs of ordinary people.

839
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,320
This is their path.

840
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,180
And I

841
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,150
will continue to follow in their path.

842
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,110
Hearing what you said,

843
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,010
I don't know

844
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,160
whether I should respect you

845
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,960
or pity you.

846
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,210
Look.

847
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,100
Teng Yue is the only one left here.

848
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,020
I don't need your admiration

849
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,420
nor your sympathy.

850
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,280
I just need you to use your talent

851
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,940
to create miracles with me.

852
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,210
Jiang Hu.

853
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,600
How do you

854
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,210
always stay

855
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,030
so confident?

856
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,900
Have you heard of this saying?

857
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,340
Cowards never set off.

858
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,940
The weak die on the way.

859
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,380
We're the only ones left advancing forward.

860
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,260
Tell me.

861
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,760
Next,

862
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,220
what do you want me to do?

863
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,300
Will you do whatever I say?

864
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,410
You're my boss now.

865
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,890
And I know

866
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,660
that Jiang Hu

867
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,410
never does business that incurs losses.

868
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,280
That's true.

869
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,710
Here's a gift to you for my employment.

870
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,300
It's getting late.

871
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,030
How about

872
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,980
we tidy up tomorrow?

873
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,740
It's quite late.

874
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:46,750
It's okay.

875
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,460
I'm not tired.

876
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,740
Take a rest.

877
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,630
They took my car.

878
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,750
I'll come and help you move tomorrow.

879
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,120
This time, although

880
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,450
I terminated the contract with TT Media

881
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,720
and I can't

882
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,550
continue

883
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,650
staying here anymore,

884
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,760
there's

885
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,850
no rush to move out.

886
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,460
The sooner you move out, the better.

887
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,690
It's more comfortable to stay at home.

888
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,680
Zhaoyang.

889
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,500
I forgot to ask you.

890
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,510
What do you think of

891
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,640
Teng Yue Factory?

892
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,350
An honest

893
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,550
and objective evaluation.

894
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,770
To be honest,

895
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,010
I can't believe

896
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,590
that the current Teng Yue Factory

897
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,380
is actually much better than those OEMs

898
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,400
of Aneda.

899
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,080
I didn't expect

900
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,760
Jiang Hu's management ability

901
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,730
to be decent.

902
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,100
I'm relieved to hear that.

903
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,470
Relieved about what?

904
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,860
You've acknowledged Jiang Hu's abilities.

905
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,470
Then you can definitely

906
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,630
cooperate well.

907
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,730
In order

908
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,540
to make it possible for me to join Teng Yue,

909
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,300
Jiang Hu not only

910
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,930
took the blame for Shangchun Art Project

911
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,430
but even signed the sales commission agreement

912
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,090
with TT Media

913
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,480
and went to Aneda

914
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,040
to buy my design.

915
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,220
What?

916
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,000
She exchanged such a big favor

917
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,090
for my freedom.

918
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,060
She's totally out of the ordinary.

919
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,200
Because of what she did,

920
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,490
I'm under a lot of pressure.

921
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,630
Jiang Hu.

922
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,690
Jiang Hu.

923
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,620
Yang?

924
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,830
Wait...

925
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,740
what is this about?

926
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,870
A feast to kill the guest?

927
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,560
Make it clear.

928
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,950
I won't eat it if you don't make it clear.

929
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,150
Fine.

930
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:52,960
I'll make it clear.

931
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,230
What is it?

932
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,310
Take this.

933
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,280
Why?

934
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,930
I'm not good at talking.

935
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,360
It's just to thank you.

936
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,930
You must have incurred a huge loss

937
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,120
in order to terminate the contract for Zhaoyang.

938
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,720
Take this

939
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,710
as a subsidy

940
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,850
for Teng Yue and you.

941
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,310
Those are separate matters.

942
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,160
Wait.

943
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,940
You don't have to be so polite with me.

944
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,650
I'm not.

945
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,270
The cooperation between Xiang Zhaoyang and I is one matter.

946
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,560
The cooperation between you and I is another matter.

947
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,360
Xiang Zhaoyang

948
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,720
is the designer hired by Teng Yue.

949
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,430
With personnel matters,

950
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,570
I have to be responsible for her.

951
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,510
You are our proxy operations agent.

952
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,790
You shouldn't bear other costs.

953
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,600
Take it back.

954
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,520
Besides, I have my ways

955
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,510
to get the money back.

956
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,410
What is it?

957
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,500
You'll know by then.

958
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,950
I know you have a lot of ideas.

959
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,610
But as you said,

960
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,430
those are separate matters.

961
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,030
Zhaoyang's matter is related to me too.

962
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,190
Take it.

963
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,170
No, Yang.

964
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,150
If Xiang Zhaoyang knows

965
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,350
that you gave me money for her,

966
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,480
it will affect what she thinks

967
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,750
of you and me.

968
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:58,690
Take it back.

969
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,730
Keep it.

970
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,190
Aren't we friends?

971
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,410
Shouldn't friends

972
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,230
tell each other

973
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,170
everything?

974
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,800
Let me ask you a question.

975
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,910
Answer me honestly.

976
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,980
Go on.

977
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,170
How do you feel

978
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,490
towards Xiang Zhaoyang?

979
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,160
What do you mean?

980
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,550
There's nothing.

981
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,040
There's obviously something.

982
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,400
I can tell.

983
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,020
You're mistaken.

984
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,550
You don't treat her as your sister.

985
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,930
Although

986
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,340
I don't get along well with her,

987
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,490
I know her

988
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,490
very well.

989
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,910
She's a typical person

990
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:11,840
who's consistently cold

991
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,950
inside and outside.

992
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,010
If you want to pursue her,

993
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,540
you have to be straightforward.

994
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,160
Roundabout tactics don't work.

995
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,380
Look at you two.

996
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,220
You've been spending so much time together for so many years

997
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,780
but your relationship's still awkward.

998
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,930
What does that mean?

999
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,690
It means that the long-term strategy is useless.

1000
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
I dare not

1001
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,860
think of Zhaoyang in that way.

1002
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,340
Usually,

1003
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,430
you're so manly.

1004
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,500
Why are you so timid

1005
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,850
in this matter?

1006
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,090
You need to drink something.

1007
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,080
I'll get the alcohol.

1008
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,130
Don't bother.

1009
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,520
Hurry.

1010
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,190
Come back.

1011
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,160
I don't drink.

1012
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,770
You don't drink?

1013
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,600
Right.

1014
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,870
I don't think I've seen you drinking before.

1015
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,630
Why?
