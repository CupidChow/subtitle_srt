You left it at my place last night.

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,430
Thank you for returning it to me.

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
It turns out that Free Unicorn

9
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,190
has been established for 30 years.

10
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,390
This year,

11
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,230
there is no

12
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,510
generous spending on theme marketing.

13
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,390
It looks a little deserted.

14
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,920
It's not grand.

15
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,050
We, in the industry,

16
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,890
don't need those hypocritical style.

17
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,990
Your generous livestream yesterday

18
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,990
was very stylish.

19
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,950
It was very impressive.

22
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,510
Is it your style

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,380
to meet different people

24
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,579

has been a merger for Hong Kong foreign investment bank, ICT,

for several years.

31
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,870
You must have made a lot of money.

32
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,420
What?

33
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,070
Are you back

34
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,280
to switch to real estate investment?

35
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,350
No.

36
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,990
To be precise,

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,510
you're unemployed now.

38
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,350
You know me so well.

39
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,270
Ms. Jiang is indeed

40
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,550
very interested in me.

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,590
I was scammed by you for

42
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
100 yuan.

43
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,110

Hello, Mr. Jiang.

49
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,700
I'm Xu Si.

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,110
I'm here to learn.

51
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:00,650
Have a seat.

52
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,830
Are the people from Baoxing Investment

53
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,010
in a hurry?

54
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,150
You haven’t officially joined Baoxing

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,070
and you've already helped them with

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,720
such a big land-buying project.

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,690
The position they gave you

58
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,710
is not bad, right?

59
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,330
I surely can't hide anything

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
from a senior of the industry.

61
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,740
Didn't they tell you that

62
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,590
Free Unicorn

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,390
will not sell Teng Yue?

64
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,290
Lord Zhaoyang.

65
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,710
What?

66
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,590
Later, in the company,

67
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,909
I'll have to call you lord.

68
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,950
Mr. Yan, I can explain.

69
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,350
200,000 followers.

70
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,670
Our company has an influencer,

71
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,780
and I didn't even know that.

72
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,230
I can explain.

73
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,030
Explain what?

74
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,909
Before you joined the company,

75
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,040
you are already an influencer.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,460
So it has nothing to do with the company.

77
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,350
No.

78
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,550
Since Weibo

79
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,030
is my personal social tool,

80
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,210
I didn't report to the company

81
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,710
when I joined.

82
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,710
So...

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,910
There is no problem that it's personal.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,390
But if you have hundreds of thousands of fans,

85
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,390
you'll have social influence.

86
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,990
Use your influence

87
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,710
to get advertisements

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,970
is not unacceptable.

89
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,550
But you went to

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,770
support our competitor.

91
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,060
What kind of nature is this?

92
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,140
Since Aneda established,

93
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,630
it's the first time that

94
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,520
we are trending with our competitor.

how will the company

99
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,590
plan to deal with this?

100
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,920
You may leave.

101
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,700
Let me think about it.

102
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,990
Okay.

103
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,170

104
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,520
the shoes you made in the video.

112

don't

What I said last night

136
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,470
was drunk talk.

137
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,470
Don't worry about it.

138
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,710
You...

139
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,030
you're acting shamelessly.

140

We were

141
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,060
on a united front just now.

Don't speak too soon.

I not only invest in real estate,

157
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,470
but also work part-time

158

to deal with bad assets.

159
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,500
Free Unicorn doesn't need it.

160

tens of millions of yuan.

168
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,800
It's almost payday.

169
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,800
Let's start with mortgaging

170
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,870
the peripheral assets that are

171
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,030
under Jiang Hu

172
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,930
to pay the wages.

173
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,430
Find Shen Gui as soon as possible.

174
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,990
We have to take out the money we invested

175
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,060
in Peace Loan.

176
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,230
Just say it.

177
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,230
Over the years,

178
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,120
we have been investing

179
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,250
a bit too much.

180
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,090
Of course, it can't be helped.

181
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,350
The industry's profit margin

182
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,750
is shrinking every year.

183
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,100
The revenue pressure on the company is huge.

184
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,480
The market is full of ups and downs.

185
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,840
This is the trend.

186
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,880
Don't worry.

187
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,700

When necessary,

190
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,060
they will have our back.

191
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,590
You must go to

192

A while ago,

I wanted to contact Shen Gui

202

203
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,870
I called Gao Yi today,

204
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,550
but he didn’t answer.

205
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,110
This kid is too introverted.

206
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,040
Besides, he has been

207
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,150
too busy recently.

208
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:46,990
So...

209
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,010
It seems that he is

210
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,810
closer to you.

211
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,990

What's wrong with 58 points?

I was sick so I didn't do well this time.

389

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,470
is Miss Jiang.

581
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,050
The first successor

582
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,920
will take responsibility

583
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,270
and inherit a huge debt.

584
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,950
This is no longer a difficult mode.

585
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,390
This is from

586
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,970
the original easy mode

587
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,930
and fall directly into the death mode.

588
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,830
The game is over immediately.

589
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,110
If it were you,

590
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,120
what would you do?

591
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,470
Such a huge debt,

592
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,660
giving up the inheritance

593
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,690
is the only clever way.

594
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,430
Thank you.

595
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,370
I was looking for you.

596
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,000
Your car.

597
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,670
I know, I know.

598
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,620
Here is the car key.

599
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,600
You borrow the car everyday since you came to Baoxing.

600
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,470
You must go out when you borrowed the car.

601
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,410
Stop talking.

602
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,950
Drive slowly.

603
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,820
I've drafted the terms of

604
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,070
Free Unicorn's stock pledge agreement.

605
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,550
I just want to keep Free Unicorn.

606
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,940
That's all.

607
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,530
Jiang Hu.

608
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,390
Don’t worry.

609
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,120
Let's talk about it.

610
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,030
About what?

611
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,160
Zhang.

612
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,960
I know.

613
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,430
Your family

614
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,590
has deeper connection with

615
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,440
Jiang family.

616
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,590
There are some facts that

617
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,040
you can't

618
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,030
tell the child.

619
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,150
But us, uncles,

620
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,120
can tell Jiang Hu

621
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,550
the truth.

622
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:24,990
Jiang Hu.

623
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,990
You have never experienced hardships.

624
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,590
You don't know anything.

625
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,400
The plan you just purposed...

626
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:31,620
What is this?

627
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,270
It's a fantasy.

628
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,640
From this,

629
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,700
It's clear that

630
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,660
you don't know

631
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,400
the market.

632
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,620
How can you do business?

633
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,070
Wang,

634
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,110
how can you

635
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,270
talk to a kid like that?

636
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,670
Jiang Hu,

637
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,210
if you want to start a business,

638
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,550
or go abroad,

639
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,660
or if you need money,

640
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,680
you can come to us.

641
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,670
We are

642
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,640
your father's good friends.

643
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,990
Everyone will help you.

644
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,950
But you have to accept the reality

645
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,270
on the matter of Free Unicorn.

646
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,740
I beg you.

647
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,500
Help me keep Free Unicorn.

648
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,040
Come up with a solution for Free Unicorn.

649
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,070
Why are you

650
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,270
so immature?

651
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,550
Why are you looking at me?

652
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,110
Let's go.

653
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,450
You're not worth teaching.

654
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,290
Jiang Hu,

655
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,430
all this time,

656
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,650
your dad had protected you well.

657
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,290
But

658
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,910
the market is cruel.

659
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,600
People are knives,

660
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,480
and you are fish.

661
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,990
This is reality.

662
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,670
Your father couldn't

663
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,990
save Free Unicorn,

664
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,470
nor can you.

665
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,510
Now,

666
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,950
you should go abroad and get married.

667
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,450
This is your best way out.

668
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,760
If you

669
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,890
come with this kind of intention

670
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:37,630
to discuss

671
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,070
a solution,

672
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,110
you will only get

673
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,270
one result.

674
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,750
That is,

675
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,000
there's no way.
