Mr. Zhou, I really can't do that.

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,230
that only an industrial park

59

Gao Yi had been with me

115
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,780
since I was very young.

116
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,240
At that time,

117
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,730
he helped me with my schoolwork every day.

118
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,460
He was very strict

119
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,290
and never cut me any slack.

120
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,430
I was so angry

121
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,230
that I put a cactus on my shoe closet

122
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,620
because he liked

123
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,850
to prop his hand on it when changing shoes.

124
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,470
No wonder

125
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,470
you like plants in the cactus family.

126
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,880
But he was also the one

127
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,920
who was always there for me.

128
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,070
Every day, we went to school

129
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,000
and came home together.

130
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,510
At that time, my dad was too busy at work

131
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,710
to take care of me.

132
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,590
Before my family took him in,

133
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,190
I'd always been alone.

134
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,210
I'd been quite lonely.

135
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,820
But after he came,

136
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,820
I got company.

137
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,180
From when I was 8 to 18,

138
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,830
whenever I was in trouble,

139
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,510
he was the first one

140
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,360
to show up.

141
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,930
He would come even before my dad.

142
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,130
He could solve all my problems.

143
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,590
I used to believe

144
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,240
I was the one he belonged with.

145
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,530
Let me tell you something interesting.

146
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,890
Xiang Zhaoyang

147
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,060
once had a thing for Gao Yi too.

148
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,230
So she was your romantic rival.

149
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,220
No wonder you two don't get along.

150
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,810
Now that I think about it, I feel stupid.

151
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,660
Do you like it better when you were a kid

152
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,950
or when you're an adult?

153
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,950
I like the present.

154
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,830
This very moment.

155
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,030
When I was young,

156
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,080
I hoped I could grow up quickly.

157
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
I thought it'd be great to be a grown-up.

158
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,220
I thought I'd be free

159
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,550
and could do whatever I wanted.

160
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,230
But these days,

161
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,360
I often wish

162
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,380
to be a kid again.

163
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,710
My dad was busy at that time,

164
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,840
but at least,

165
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,540
he was there.

166
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,190
Jiang Hu.

167
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,020
In the future,

168
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,610
I'll always be with you.

169
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,870
Are you hungry?

170
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,140
Why are you still here?

171
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,730
I worked overtime

172
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,900
to discuss the production plan.

173
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,150
So,

174
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,230
I asked the canteen

175
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,510
to make some dumplings for you.

176
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,570
Here.

177
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,110
Eat before they get cold.

178
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,960
You worked late

179
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,470
and should go home

180
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,580
and have a good rest.

181
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,290
Jiang Hu borrowed my car.

182
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,430
I'll wait for her to come back

183
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,580
and then go home with you.

184
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,080
Why did she borrow your car?

185
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,970
She said something about the sales.

186
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,710
Did she

187
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,380
say something else?

188
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,960
Zhaoyang.

189
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,430
I could tell

190
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,560
that Jiang Hu was in a bad mood too.

191
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,110
Have you two

192
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,740
quarreled again?

193
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,590
I'll tell you another time.

194
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
How do they taste?

195
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,430
How are you gonna go home?

196
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,420
How about

197
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,350
you drive this car back?

198
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,850
No.

199
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,170
Driving here was hard enough.

200
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,510
I'm not used to driving this car.

201
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,030
So picky.

202
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,030
What?

203
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,430
Are you worried that it's not safe for me to go home alone

204
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,330
at this late hour?

205
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,990
I don't have to go home.

206
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,430
I'll book a taxi for you.

207
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,820
It's quick.

208
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,710
It'll arrive in a few minutes.

209
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,470
A few minutes

210
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,710
is long enough for us

211
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,830
to do something exciting.

212
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,830
What are you thinking?

213
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,950
I mean a goodbye kiss.

214
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,089
Not here.

215
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,710
Then where?

216
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,589
Don't take advantage of me.

217
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,940
I'm not taking advantage of you.

218
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,210
We've already…

219
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,150
Hello?

220
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes.

221
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,980
Teng Yue Factory

222
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,040
on Route 3.

223
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,720
You've arrived?

224
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:23,950
Okay.

225
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,950
We'll come out now.

226
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:25,750
Okay.

227
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,390
See you later.

228
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,670
The taxi is here.

229
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,570
This is how I want

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,610
to end this day.

231
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,610
I'm going back.

232
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,900
You should go back and have a good rest too.

233
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,540
You scared the life out of me.

234
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,280
Why are you standing here?

235
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,190
Are you

236
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,200
in a serious relationship with him?

237
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,990
You're a grown woman and can call your own shots.

238
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,080
What's that tone?

239
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,690
I don't

240
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,720
like him anyway.

241
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,430
Zhaoyang is coming.

242
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,570
All right.

243
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,940
You two go home now.

244
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,550
Jiang Hu.

245
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,430
What's the matter?

246
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,040
Forget it.

247
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,270
We can talk tomorrow.

248
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:01,510
Okay.

249
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,910
See you tomorrow.

250
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,420
Hello.

251
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,950
Did you get home safe?

252
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,620
I just got home.

253
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,430
What took you so long?

254
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,350
I went to the riverside

255
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,410
and drove my car home.

256
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,320
What a picky man.

257
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,830
Go to bed early.

258
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,030
You know what?

259
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,640
I think I can

260
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,920
definitely have a good sleep tonight.

261
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,990
I'm hanging up.

262
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,390
I need

263
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,480
a sweet "good night."

264
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,050
Good night.

265
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,600
Good night.

266
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,450
Scum.

267
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,270
Look.

268
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,550
The side needs to be flawless.

269
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,280
You see it?

270
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,950
Master Zhang.

271
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,870
I'm very much lacking

272
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,080
in practical experience.

273
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,550
You need to learn this trade by practicing.

274
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm only so experienced

275
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,750
because I've worked for many years.

276
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,710
Teng Yue

277
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,390
is where it is today,

278
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,110
all thanks to

279
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,590
you and Ms. Jiang.

280
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,070
Where is Jiang Hu?

281
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,530
I didn't see her

282
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,880
in the factory this morning.

283
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,090
She went to meet Mr. Fang.

284
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,680
If we can

285
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,150
sell our shoes in his stores,

286
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,710
Teng Yue will land on its feet.

287
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:02,760
Right?

288
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,850
I'll check over there.

289
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,850
Okay.

290
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,970
I'll drink it then.

291
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,390
You're great at brewing tea.

292
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,750
I can't find any fault

293
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,470
with it.

294
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,630
As I recall,

295
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,220
your dad was not much of a tea drinker.

296
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,270
He preferred wine.

297
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,750
So in the past,

298
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,670
I often prepared hot wine for him.

299
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,010
He told me

300
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,430
the best way to show respect to my elders

301
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,560
was to find out what they liked.

302
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,950
Du told me

303
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,570
you were quite something.

304
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,540
From what I've seen recently,

305
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,710
you're indeed something.

306
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,750
Thank you for your appreciation.

307
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,150
By the way,

308
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,500
did you receive the contract

309
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,170
I sent you yesterday?

310
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,410
Yes.

311
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,370
Mr. Fang.

312
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
You're willing to give a hand

313
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,270
to Teng Yue at this time.

314
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,580
I'm really grateful.

315
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,140
Well,

316
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,310
in the next couple of days,

317
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,510
the legal and accounting departments

318
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,450
of our two companies

319
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,630
will go through the procedures.

320
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,910
In the future, Fang Yuan and Teng Yue

321
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,370
will continue

322
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,610
the 20-year-long friendship

323
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,790
between me and your dad.

324
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,590
[KPI for Q3: 8,820,000]

325
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,590
[KPI for Q4: 26,460,000]

326
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:18,720
Zhaoyang.

327
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,450
You wanted to see me?

328
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,670
Come.

329
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,020
I have something to tell you too.

330
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,420
I've put my resignation letter

331
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,580
on your desk.

332
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,690
What do you mean?

333
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,000
Teng Yue needs to grow its business now.

334
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,710
I respect your choice.

335
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,710
But I have my bottom line.

336
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,480
During the time I worked here,

337
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,950
I decided on the design style

338
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,700
of Teng Yue.

339
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,720
The new designer

340
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,430
won't have much trouble continuing my work.

341
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:53,950
Xiang Zhaoyang.

342
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,380
You always say I live in my own world.

343
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,250
I've found

344
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,640
that you live in your own world too.

345
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,580
It's not hard for Teng Yue

346
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,580
to hire new people now.

347
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:04,960
I won't leave

348
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,390
until you find a new designer

349
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,990
and I hand over my work.

350
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,700
If you leave now,

351
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,750
who's gonna help me get Lidu's project

352
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,230
for the Chinese Fashion Festival?

353
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,710
The Chinese Fashion Festival…

354
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,810
You keep saying that I'm like my dad,

355
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,390
but actually,

356
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,730
I'm different from him.

357
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,460
Xiang Zhaoyang

358
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,610
is the chief designer of Teng Yue.

359
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,310
So,

360
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,070
you're refusing to cooperate with me?

361
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,600
Among all my choices,

362
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,670
I've chosen the one

363
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,950
that's the least commercial.

364
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,390
But

365
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,340
we both know

366
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,210
working with me

367
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,540
is your best choice.

368
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,750
Mr. Fang.

369
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,940
Goodbye.

370
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,680
Teng Yue had a fall in production

371
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,880
in this quarter.

372
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,070
You know it.

373
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,820
We lost the outsourced orders

374
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,920
and haven't met

375
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,910
the KPI yet.

376
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,650
If we can't get the project of Lidu,

377
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,670
our online store

378
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,870
and those small distributors alone

379
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,120
can't save us from doom

380
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,630
in the next quarter.

381
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,230
You

382
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,710
rejected Mr. Fang?

383
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,190
That's why I'm under a lot of pressure now.

384
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,920
So be good

385
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,310
and don't put more pressure on me, okay?

386
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,430
Jiang Hu.

387
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,990
I don't know what to say.

388
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,280
You don't have to say anything.

389
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,860
What matters is what you do.

390
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,230
Thank you.

391
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,910
Show me that you mean it

392
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,790
by working hard on this project.

393
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,910
Okay.

394
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,240
You said something's on my desk.

395
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,400
What's it?

396
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,600
Did I say that?

397
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,570
I'll go take a look.

398
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,990
Jiang Hu said

399
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,350
there's no need to adjust the sales goal

400
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,180
for the next quarter.

401
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,410
She's taking a daring move again.

402
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,120
Actually,

403
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,120
if she can successfully build

404
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,730
offline distribution channels,

405
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,510
it won't be a hard task.

406
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,270
Besides,

407
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,510
as you requested,

408
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,550
I've reminded her

409
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,940
that she needs

410
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,270
more professional sales staff.

411
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,200
I'll go.

412
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,230
Okay.

413
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,150
Fei.

414
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,270
What's up? You miss me?

415
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,920
Uncle Xu Si.

416
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,110
Do you have plans tonight?

417
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,260
I want to treat you to dinner.

418
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,770
Your parents are away on business trips again?

419
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,870
Later,

420
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,910
I'll talk some sense

421
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,200
into your dad.

422
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,230
He can't put his work before you.

423
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,490
That's not the case.

424
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,770
It has nothing to do with my dad.

425
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,380
I'll treat you to dinner.

426
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,470
You…

427
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
You'll treat me to dinner?

428
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,090
Jiang Hu invited me

429
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,350
to dinner at her canteen.

430
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,110
How can I not take you with me?

431
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,800
I'd feel like a bad friend.

432
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,830
Jiang Hu invited you?

433
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,110
I rejected Fang.

434
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,400
So we must

435
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,780
cooperate with Lidu.

436
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,220
Why?

437
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,910
Fang

438
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,990
did things

439
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,470
that made me not want to work with him.

440
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,370
Did he do something to you?

441
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,620
No.

442
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,220
Does he have a bad reputation

443
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,600
in the industry?

444
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,480
His reputation…

445
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,990
It was why your dad

446
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,710
wouldn't have

447
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,740
close collaboration with him.

448
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,580
In the end,

449
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,660
he found Zhang Jianguo.

450
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
But he was no good either.

451
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,710
I have to choose someone I can accept

452
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,220
among the people who disgust me.

453
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,870
Guess I don't have much choice, do I?

454
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,980
You've done quite well.

455
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,740
Don't feel frustrated.

456
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,320
Starting a business

457
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,510
is like going against a headwind.

458
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,750
Things happen.

459
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,390
By the way,

460
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,380
I'm going to officially establish a sales department.

461
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,190
You sound confident.

462
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,950
You've decided

463
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,710
who will be the sales director?

464
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,710
Who's it?

465
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,810
[Shoe Last Room]

466
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,080
That's what Teng Yue was like

467
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,110
in the '80s and '90s.

468
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,470
Teng Yue can bring back

469
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,380
many people's childhood memories.

470
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,910
Before we launched new products,

471
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,950
old Teng Yue shoes

472
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,530
sold well too.

473
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,510
Most of the customers were regulars.

474
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,970
They grew up

475
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,600
wearing Teng Yue shoes.

476
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,990
There's a bond between them and Teng Yue.

477
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,480
Back then,

478
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,590
students, athletes,

479
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,900
workers, and farmers

480
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,210
all wore Teng Yue shoes.

481
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,300
Look at Teng Yue's logo.

482
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,720
Doesn't it look like a flying eagle?

483
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,840
It's beautiful.

484
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,740
People love it.

485
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,230
Boss, sit down.

486
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,700
Boss.

487
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,420
Sit down.

488
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,340
You're so smart, Boss.

489
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,090
Uncle Xu, come and play with us.

490
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,190
He's a good boy.

491
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,030
He doesn't bite.

492
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,570
Play with him yourself.

493
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,280
I'll pass.

494
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,150
Don't bring him over.

495
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,790
Just play there.

496
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,030
You're no fun.

497
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,920
Uncle Xu is such a coward.

498
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,990
Boss, he's afraid of you.

499
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,100
Boss.

500
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,150
Let's give Uncle Xu

501
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,010
a hug.

502
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,940
No, thanks.

503
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,640
Don't hug me.

504
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,190
Fei.

505
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,150
You're no fun.

506
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,190
What are you doing here?

507
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,220
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

508
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,670
Fei.

509
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,280
You said

510
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,380
your dad would send you here.

511
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,160
Yeah.

512
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,690
My godfather sent me here.

513
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,070
So you meant that father.

514
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,630
Kiddo.

515
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,030
Jiang Hu.

516
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,980
Boss is a great name.

517
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,580
You've found out his name?

518
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,200
I'll ask my dad

519
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,240
to buy me a puppy.

520
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,390
I'll call it Boss too.

521
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,050
Your puppy

522
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,230
should be called Kid,

523
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,150
not Boss.

524
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,430
Do you know why?

525
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,860
Because that's a really smart kid.

526
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,640
Doesn't it suit you?

527
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,960
Are you hungry?

528
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,830
Let's go eat.

529
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,380
Okay.

530
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,550
Boss, let's go.

531
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,070
Let's go.

532
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,990
You invited that kid to dinner but didn't invite me.

533
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,780
Why?

534
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,820
You didn't invite me either.

535
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
You're so bad.

536
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,000
Having dinner with you

537
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,210
is not part of my plan today.

538
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,660
Do I have to make an appointment

539
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,000
to see my girlfriend?

540
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,530
It's working hours.

541
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,600
It's working hours.

542
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,600
It's not.

543
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,470
Boss's saliva.

544
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,530
They don't

545
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,390
work nine to five in this factory.

546
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,150
It's awful.

547
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,670
Fei.

548
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,680
Has your mom been filming a show

549
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,220
in Studio City all this week?

550
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,620
Let me test you.

551
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,840
What kind of show

552
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,710
is your mom filming?

553
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,750
Who's filming it with her?

554
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,390
Jiang Hu.

555
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,670
You're not testing me.

556
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,310
You're extracting information from me.

557
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,950
Fei.

558
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,670
For the sake

559
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,300
of the delicious pork ribs,

560
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,270
please feed me some information, will you?

561
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,150
Okay.

562
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,910
My mom is filming

563
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,560
a variety show about agents like her.

564
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,820
She's filming it with Mr. Song Qian

565
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,930
and Xu Ling.

566
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,950
Well,

567
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,470
Mr. Hao Mai

568
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,020
who I don't like very much is there too.

569
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,420
Are Fan Mei and Lin Xiang

570
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,330
with her as well?

571
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,390
Jiang Hu.

572
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,670
Can I have another pork steak?

573
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,110
Of course.

574
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,130
You're eating a lot.

575
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,800
I'll ask your dad

576
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,949
to pay me for the food.

577
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,790
I'm eating at the canteen

578
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,780
of Jiang Hu's factory.

579
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,550
You're not the one who should be paid.

580
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,199
Besides, you're my godfather.

581
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,909
You should pay Jiang Hu

582
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,110
for everything I ate.

583
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,989
Alright.

584
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,830
Go ask the chef

585
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,080
to give you another pork steak.

586
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,550
Okay.

587
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,560
Thank you, Jiang Hu.

588
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,260
You're welcome.

589
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,650
Don't ask for more than you can eat.

590
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,690
You know so much about that variety show

591
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,310
and asked Fei out for dinner.

592
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:48,989
You must

593
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,600
be up to something.

594
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,750
Tell me.

595
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,150
What are you planning?

596
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,110
I'm not planning anything.

597
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,720
Teng Yue

598
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,010
is engraved in many people's

599
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,480
childhood memories.

600
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,030
I know what to do next.

601
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,510
Dinner was great.

602
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,910
Thank you, Jiang Hu.

603
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm glad you enjoyed it, Fei.

604
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,830
Come again soon.

605
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,810
Boss is waiting for you

606
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,720
to play with him.

♫When the flowers on the riverbank bloom♫

♫Don't be so honest if you want to leave♫

♫Find excuses to cover it up anymore♫

613

It's cute.

I don't understand you.

631
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,670
Why are you working

632
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,830
for Jiang Hu?

633
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,470
Look at yourself.

634
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,850
You're not earning half as much as you did

635
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,350
and have to get up so early every day

636
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,380
to catch the subway.

637
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,420
Don't talk about me.

638
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,810
Where did you go last night?

639
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,590
Did you play mahjong again?

640
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,990
No.

641
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,860
I don't play mahjong

642
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,000
or play the market now.

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,260
Rest assured.

644
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,630
Be careful.

645
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,970
Don't be fooled again.

646
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,830
That's hurtful.

647
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,380
Can't you say something nice?

648
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,690
It's my fault.

649
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,720
I failed to raise you

650
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,760
into a sweet girl.

651
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,160
My bad.

652
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,670
You're making me speechless.

653
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,390
Tomorrow is Jian's birthday.

654
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,660
Don't forget to bring a gift back.

655
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,470
You never forget

656
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,560
Yang Jian's birthday.

657
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,210
Of course.

658
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,210
If there's anything about my third husband

659
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,110
that's commendable,

660
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,630
it's that he has a son

661
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,960
who has a kind heart.

662
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,040
Jian

663
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,260
is willing to do anything for us

664
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,570
to atone for his father's sins.

665
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,610
What do you take Yang Jian for?

666
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
What a weird question.

667
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,140
I've told you

668
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,980
that I think of him as my son.

669
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,380
Ask yourself that question.

670
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,900
Since you were little,

671
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,450
you've been mean to him.

672
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,740
Are you stupid?

673
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,830
Before you find

674
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,690
a better man to marry,

675
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,500
you still need him.

676
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,990
Dealing with men

677
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,080
can be tricky.

678
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,150
You need to be gentle.

679
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,830
Understand?

680
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,570
Why do you look angry? Listen to me.

681
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,720
With some small tricks,

682
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
your life will be gentler,

683
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,420
better,

684
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,920
and have more sunshine.

685
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,980
Do you understand?

686
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,540
Silly girl.

687
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,260
Give me two hours

688
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,690
of your time this evening.

689
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,310
Let's have dinner together.

690
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,420
Not tonight.

691
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,830
I have to work overtime for a meeting.

692
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,790
How about tomorrow?

693
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,460
No.

694
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,750
We'll have a team-building activity tomorrow.

695
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,490
Team-building?

696
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,830
Hey, Jiang Hu.

697
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,540
Do a door-to-door survey with you tomorrow?

698
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,830
What survey?

699
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,730
You mean market research?

700
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,470
Okay.

701
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:13,990
No problem.

702
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,870
Okay.

703
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,210
Wu.

704
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,900
Jiang Hu has got Boss.

705
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,630
We'll proceed as planned tomorrow.

706
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,750
How's it?

707
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:38,670
Boss.

708
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,510
The evaluation report

709
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,470
for Dexing's factory

710
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,470
and equipment

711
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,430
has been sent to your email.

712
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,920
And this.

713
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,150
Joey asked me to give it to you.

714
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,280
It's information about Smart Production Line.

715
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,640
Where is he?

716
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,900
Has he got off work already?

717
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,200
He went on a blind date last week.

718
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,770
He has a girlfriend now.

719
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,050
He even

720
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,430
booked a restaurant today.

721
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,830
He shouldn't

722
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,780
have dinner with her every day.

723
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,780
He should

724
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,010
give her some space.

725
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,160
That's a cliche.

726
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,320
You know nothing about relationships.

727
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,510
What century is this?

728
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,350
The 21st century.

729
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,470
The 21st century

730
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,190
is a century that prioritizes efficiency.

731
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,650
When you just start seeing a girl,

732
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,210
you should

733
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,050
spend as much time with her as you can.

734
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,230
Being apart for a day

735
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,140
will be like being apart for three years.

736
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,970
Three days will be like ten years.

737
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,790
If you two are apart any longer,

738
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,470
love will be gone

739
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,950
and you'll be strangers.

740
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,270
You've never been in a relationship.

741
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,810
What do you know about relationships?

742
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,890
Since you're not seeing anyone,

743
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,310
you can work overtime tonight.

744
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,910
Aneda has given feedback

745
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,410
about the due diligence reports

746
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,250
of those shoe brands.

747
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,880
Ask Mei's secretary

748
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,900
to go over it with you.

749
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,590
Go.

750
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,930
Yes, sir.

751
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,080
Poor single man.

752
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,180
I can have 10 girlfriends if I want to.

753
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,640
Make it 100.

754
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,190
Hey, Zhou Qing.

755
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:08,790
I'm reading it.

756
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,380
You want to talk about the proposal tonight?

757
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,590
Okay.

758
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,880
I'll wait for you in the company.

759
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:21,830
Okay.

760
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,820
Having a girlfriend does spare me from working overtime.
