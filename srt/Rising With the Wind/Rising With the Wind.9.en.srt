00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,230
I believe in

195
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,720
your professionalism in this.

196
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,600
You're even so good at chess.

197
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,190
I have nothing to worry about.

198
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,630
Just have at it.

199
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,830
The advertisements in the atrium here

200
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,110
need to be adjusted.

201
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,590
The placement over there

202
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,710
also needs to be adjusted.

203
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,490
It's okay.

206
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,030
The top host of TT Media,

207
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,590
Nan,

208
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,690
stalked the new host signed by TT Media, took candid photos of her,

209
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,390
and paid online haters to smear her.

210
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,440
I didn't expect

211
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,930
it turns out to be

212
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
your company's internal friction.

213
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,420
I can't believe

214
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,160
you got the surveillance footage of our office.

215
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,040
[Jiang Hu]

216
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,640
Hanging up on me?

217
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,800
How ridiculous!

218
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,620
I just want to remind you that

219
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,080
the internal management of your company

220
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,690
is going out of control.

221
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,640
This shouldn't happen

222
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,440
in a top influencer marketing agency.

223
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I will fix

224
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,000
the relationship between Nan and Zhaoyang.

225
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,290
As for Nan,

226
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,710
what's your opinion on his punishment?

227
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,750
I'll leave it to your discretion.

228
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,030
After all,

229
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,590
there's currently no host in TT Media

230
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,020
who has a better performance than Nan.

231
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,220
I thought...

232
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,170
You thought what?

233
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,590
I thought the rumor Nan started was true.

234
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,880
We've known each other for so many years,

235
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,930
but you still don't know me well.

236
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,130
Now I do.

237
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,680
As long as it's about work,

238
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,930
no one is human to you.

239
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,130
They're all tools.

240
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,610
As expected from you, Xu Si.

241
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,220
I'm leaving.

242
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,190
You told me off

243
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,200
this early in the morning.

244
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,430
I need to cool off.

245
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:53,930
Hello?

246
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,670
What's up?

247
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,570
I dirtied your clothes

248
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,820
at C Club last time, right?

249
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,310
I bought a new one to make it up to you.

250
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,250
Today?

251
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,200
I'll text you where and when.

252
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,750
See you tonight.

253
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:10,870
Hello?

254
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,600
Hello?

255
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:15,860
See you tonight?

256
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,420
What the heck?

257
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,000
[Wish you good fortune] [May wealth come generously to you]

[Bo's Ginger Chicken]

259
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:40,970
Have a seat.

260
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,030
What do you want to eat?

261
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,300
Take a look at the menu yourself.

262
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,980
You read it right.

263
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,640
The average cost here is 50 to 60 yuan per capita.

264
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,270
This doesn't match

265
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,120
your usual lavish lifestyle.

266
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,440
You're saving money for me?

267
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,720
This place is my choice,

268
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,780
so this meal is on me.

269
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,890
You're not trying

270
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,740
to make an issue of it

271
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,230
and mock me again, are you?

272
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,170
If I don't take the opportunity of this meal

273
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,670
to play some tricks,

274
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,550
I'll fail to live up

275
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,780
to your imagination, right, Ms. Jiang?

276
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,870
Xu, you're here.

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,150

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,930
and Eggplant Stew?

283
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,700
Miss, would you like to order something else?

284
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,710
Chinese Kale with Black Bean Sauce,

285
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,320
and Dry-fried Green Beans.

286
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,840
Okay. Okay.

287
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,210
All vegetables.

288
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,750

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,140
some Honey Lemon Tea?

293
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,990

295
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,470
Don't worry.

296
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,390
After drinking the milk tea, your worries will be gone.

297
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,220
Hong Kong-style Milk Tea is our specialty.

298

299
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,960
No.

300
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,810
I'll have lemonade.

301
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,370
I don't rely on sugar to relieve my stress.

302
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,060

you're not in a good mood.

307
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,290
Is it because of that rumor online?

308
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,310
Don't ask about things that don't concern you.

309
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,420
I won't vent my anger on you,

310

Why are you smiling?

312
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,750
It seems that the rumor online

313
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,520
did cause big trouble

314
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,030
to your work.

315

Why are you so sure?

316
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,630
Couldn't it be for personal matters?

319
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,400
nor the type of person

320
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,150
who'd be troubled by

321
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,090
some private scandals.

322
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,790
You know me well, Ms. Jiang.

323
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,400
After all,

324
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,510
we've had so many weird interactions, right?

325
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,880
Didn't you say

326
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,390
you have clothes for me

327
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,410
when you asked me out today?

328
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,560
Is this it?

329
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,210
Yes.

330
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,930
Right.

331
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,030
Here you are.

332
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,780
Gifts should be able to blind the eyes,

333
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,720
but I'm an exception.

334
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,100
Even though you gave me a gift today,

335
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,670
the "military writ" of selling 20,000 pairs of shoes a month

336
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,630
is still valid.

337
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,130
I won't go easy on you.

338
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
What are you talking about?

339
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,990
This is just my compensation

340
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,150
for offending you last time, okay?

341
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,990
And to say thank you, Mr. Investor,

342
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,280
for taking some time off

343
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,700
your busy schedule to have dinner with me.

344
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,540
It must have cost you dearly.

345
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,990
How do you know my size?

346
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
I grew up in Free Unicorn.

347
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,710
Estimating the size of clothes

348
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,950
is my professionalism.

349
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,080
I thought...

350
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,870
What?

351
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,710
Don't make random assumptions.

352
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,510
Don't doubt

353
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,510
my professionalism in this business.

354
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,660
I will definitely make Teng Yue

355
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,170
rise again.

356
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,050
All you want to talk about is Teng Yue.

357
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,630

358
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,880
Try it.

359
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,730
I don't want to talk about work today.

[Bo's]

361

Thank you.

362
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,230
I'm off.

363
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,900
When did you get another moped?

364
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,860
I didn't charge mine.

365
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,200
This is Qin's moped.

366
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,200
54%.

367
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,740
Give me a ride to the parking lot.

368
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,560
Where's your car?

369
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,290
At that hour,

370
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,790
do you think four wheels could be faster than subway?

371
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,070
I came by subway.

372
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,930
I'll get a taxi for you.

373
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,470
It's hard to get a taxi at this hour.

374
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,700
I don't want to wait.

375
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,630
There're shared bikes over there.

376
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,690
A competitor invested in these.

377
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,850
I didn't install the App.

378
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,690
Why are you so troublesome?

379
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,470
It's just I've never given anyone a ride on my moped before.

380
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,650
Even if you dare to come,

381
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,950

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,270
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,150
Come on.

576
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,420
Take care.

577
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,480
Let's go over there.

578
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,890
What's this about?

579
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,220
Let's go.

580
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,990
It's okay. Let's go.

581
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,110
Let's come again tomorrow.

582
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,890
They're bullying us.

583
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,030
Exactly.

584
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,830
Du.

585
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,210
After all, their team

586
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,340
is going to attend the competition.

587
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,910
You can't compete with them.

588
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,510
Besides, they even have a truck.

589
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,860
Their speakers

590
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,380
are also much better than yours,

591
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,370
which is about to be broken.

592
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,810
You're not professional.

593
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,160
It's okay. I know what to do.

594
00:35:59,410 --> 00:35:59,890
Let's go.

595
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,660
That's all for today.

596
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,330
Let's come again tomorrow.

597
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,550
Music start.

598
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,720
That's all for today.

599
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,780
Let's go.

600
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,490
Start.

601
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,870
One, two, three, four.

602
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,120
Good.

603
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,880
Come on.

604
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,030
Left, right. Left, right.

605
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,030
Hands up.

606
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,060
Right.

607
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,360
Smile.

608
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,840
Show your energy.

609
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,660
Great.

610
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,220
Qin.

611
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,460
Something's not right with you today.

612
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,680
What's wrong?

613
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,660
Your couldn't get your tempo right.

614
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,370
Can you blame me for this?

615
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,700
It's all your fault.

616
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Why is it my fault?

617
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,900
You asked us all

618
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,510
to wear the shoes you bought.

619
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,830
A pair only costs 30 yuan.

620
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,270
How good can the quality possibly be?

621
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,560
Look at my feet.

622
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,900
They've been swollen for a week.

623
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,530
How can I possibly get the tempo right?

624
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,290
Look.

625
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,740
It still hurts.

626
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,200
Exchange my shoes for another pair.

627
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,350
As long as the shoes are not damaged,

628
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,510
you can exchange them within 7 days.

629
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,530
But it's been 14 days. You can't exchange them now.

630
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,190
Let me see what the problem is.

631
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,750
Qin.

632
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,020
Your feet are different-sized.

633
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,410
You can't blame it on the shoes.

634
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,600
This is an old brand.

635
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,560
The quality is very good.

636
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,320
For real.

637
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,200
Your feet are different-sized.

638
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,460
-How about this?
-What?

639
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,970
You just squatted and took a look,

640
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,550
and suddenly it's my problem?

641
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,500
Of course.

642
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,730
I've been selling shoes for half of my life.

643
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,870
I can tell

644
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,380
whose feet are different-sized at a glance.

645
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,350
How about this?

646
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,900
Give me 18 yuan.

647
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,170
Your left foot is size 37,

648
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,480
and your right foot may be size 37.5,

649
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,550
or even 38.

650
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,140
I'll give you a pair of different-sized shoes.

651
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,550
I'll only charge you for 18 yuan,

652
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,310
and your problem will be gone.

653
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,410
It won't hurt, wearing these.

654
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,790
Du.

655
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,530
My feet hurt too.

656
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,600
Could it also be my feet are different-sized?

657
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,440
It's possible.

658
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,260
Don't be nervous.

659
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,470
It's normal to have different-sized feet.

660
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,820
Basically, everyone has it.

661
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,020
You won't feel it when you walk normally every day,

662
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,850
only during strenuous exercise.

663
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,830
If you need it,

664
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,170
I'll give every one of you a new pair.

665
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,280
It's definitely comfortable to wear.

666
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,170
Then give us a discount.

667
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,870
Yes.

668
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,620
Make it cheaper.

669
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,240
We can only wear those

670
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,960
for square dances,

671
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,240
not in any other occasion.

672
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,740
These shoes are only 39 yuan per pair.

673
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,350
How much does a cup of Starbucks

674
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,980
cost our grandchildren?

675
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,600
How about this?

676
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,800
You each hand in 13 yuan,

677
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,170
and I'll give each of you a pair of different-sized shoes.

678
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,560
And 3 yuan more

679
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,480
for loafer shoelaces.

680
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,350
One pair for each.

681
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,790
You won't need to tie your shoelaces anymore.

682
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,030
How's that?

683
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,510
Great.

684
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,470
You can exchange it within a month

685
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,720
if there's any problem.

686
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,550
Okay, okay.

687
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,250
I'll take one.

688
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,430
Do you want to buy shoes, Miss?

689
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,740
So you're an insurance agent.

690
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,650
Listen.

691
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,710
I have social security.

692
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,420
I don't need it.

693
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,170
Besides, I don't take health supplements.

694
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,760
I'm even healthier

695
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,950
than you young people.

696
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,760
I don't need

697
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,630
credit cards or anything like that.

698
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:33,970
Stop following me.

699
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,760
Mr. Du.

700
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,890
Hello, Mr. Du.

701
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,390
I'm from Teng Yue.

702
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,040
I brought you some coffee

703
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,280
as a gift to our old distributor.

704
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,070
Santa Ines?

705
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,800
Fifty dollars per pound.

706
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,910
Teng Yue never spends this much

707
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,340
on customer rewards.

708
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,230
Mr. Du, you're our regular guest.

709
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,320
You know how good the imported goods are.

710
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,910
Don't let such good stuff go to waste.

711
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,080
As for you...

712
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,650
Go back.

713
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,670
After selling this batch of goods,

714
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,940
I will never

715
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,310
stock your products again.

716
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,210
Mr. Du.

717
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,750
Mr. Du.

718
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,970
I hope you can help us

719
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,360
to expand other distribution channels.

720
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,100
I saw you selling different-sized shoes just now.

721
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,860
I think it's a great idea.

722
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,520
No wonder my dad always said

723
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,470
you know how to sell shoes.

724
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,200
Who is your dad?

725
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,520
Jiang Qisheng.

726
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,950
Jiang Qisheng would talk about me?

727
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,260
Are you Jiang Hu?

728
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,880
You're just like your dad.

729
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,040
You can make up stories even without drafts.

730
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,640
It's true.

731
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,180
Mr. Du, don't you doubt it.

732
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,510
Let me help you with the speaker...

733
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,390
Jiang Qisheng.

734
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,630
We stopped talking to each other

735
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,670
over 10 years ago.

736
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,330
There's no reason for us to get back in touch now.

737
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,230
It's okay.

738
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,130
We can start over.

739
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,350
If you need anything

740
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,300
in the future,

741
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,780
you can call me anytime.

742
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,960
I will do my best to help you.

743
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,580
Do your best?

744
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:47,340
[Changle Restaurant]

745
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,140
I've asked.

746
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,630
This is the established

747
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,270
coaxial speaker called Tannoy Stirling

748
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,260
sold in Hong Kong in the 90s.

749
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,760
No one we know knows how to fix it.

750
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,030
The limos

751
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,850
of San's wedding company

752
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,040
are all occupied for Wedding Expo.

753
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,400
The exhibition will only be over in 5 days.

754
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,810
Ke's car service and retail store

755
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,190
is under close watch by the brand.

756
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,940
There are 24-hour surveillance cameras in the store.

757
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,760
There's no way.

758
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,240
Does the car have to be so expensive?

759
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,050
It's just for square dances.

760
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,560
As long as it can play music, right?

761
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,100
Why does he have to make it

762
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,990
like a concert?

763
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,860
I didn't expect

764
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,510
Mr. Du would propose

765
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,880
such a ridiculous request either.

766
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,710
He asked me to repair his speaker

767
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,480
and rent a limo for him.

768
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,000
It's making my head hurt.

769
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,650
Is Mr. Du really that good?

770
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,140
He really is good at

771
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,530
selling shoes.

772
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,780
He has a lot of channels.

773
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,980
If I can get him,

774
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,310
I can get the investors.
