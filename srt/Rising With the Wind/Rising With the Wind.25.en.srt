00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,390
Mr. Fang.

6
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,039
Jiang Hu,

7
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,570
what a coincidence.

8
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,470
I was specially waiting for you.

9
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,910
Every time you come to me,

10
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,509
you should go to the company.

11
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,820
Why waste time waiting for me here?

12
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,470
Because

13
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,550
I have a deal with you.

14
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,270
You are the senior.

15
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,830
I won't dare to discuss

16
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,150
cooperating with you

17
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,039
before I

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,940
reorganized Teng Yue.

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,190
Yes.

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,240
What kind of cooperation?

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,990
Let me hear it.

22
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,270
Teng Yue

23
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,550
is on track now.

24
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,360
Two new product lines

25
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,050
will be officially released the day after tomorrow.

26
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,660
In addition to online preorders,

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,390
we also accept offline orders.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,570
Mr. Fang,

29
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,840
I would like to invite you

30
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,020
to witness the moment

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,360
of Teng Yue's rebirth.

32
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,790
When is it?

33
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,550
Tomorrow,

34
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,560
aren't we going on a business trip?

35
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,300
It's at 10 a.m. the day after tomorrow.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,910
Mr. Fang, you must come.

37
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,770
It'll be more meaningful with you there.

38
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,640
Okay.

39
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,560
I'll try my best.

40
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,530
Okay,

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,220
I'll try.

42
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,900
I look forward to your coming.

43
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,880
Okay.

44
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,170
I'm not sure if Jiang Hu

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
is willing to participate in this event.

46
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,310
Mr. Pei knows about this too.

47
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,360
He's discussing it with me now.

48
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,980
Ms. Yue,

49
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,850
is there any misunderstanding

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,750
between Jiang Hu and Gao Yi?

51
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,990
Why do you ask?

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,910
They grew up together.

53
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,829
Logically speaking,

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,560
after Jiang Hu's dad passed away,

55
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,829
they shouldn't deliberately

56
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,590
avoid each other.

57
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,510
I can only tell you

58
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,270
that Gao Yi has nothing to do

59
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,320
with the Jiang family anymore.

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,300
Uncle.

61
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,140
You're back?

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,880
Let me tell you something.

63
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,900
We have good news from the distributors?

64
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,820
No, not this.

65
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,320
That...

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,680
That Lidu Department Store

67
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,500
is going to hold

68
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,640
a national

69
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,720
Chinese fashion brand sale.

70
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,580
So what?

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,480
Well,

72
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,230
our Teng Yue

73
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,610
is also a Chinese fashion brand,

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,090
right?

75
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,110
Let's see if we can

76
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,190
take this opportunity

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
to promote

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,390
our new products

79
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,350
and boost

80
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,100
the sales.

81
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,500
Last quarter,

82
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,600
Lidu was in the top three

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,460
for the performance ranking

84
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,710
of all department stores.

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,410
So many brands

86
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,230
are trying their best

87
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,270
to get into Lidu.

88
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,880
How could they

89
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,470
give this chance

90
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,350
to a small factory like us

91
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,390
whose annual sales don't even reach seven digits?

92
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,110
Don't underestimate yourself.

93
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,970
Your connections

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,570
are there.

95
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,270
That

96
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,490
Gao Yi,

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,280
right?

98
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,920
Gao Yi has a powerful voice

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,950
in Lidu.

100
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,300
You grew up

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,360
with him.

102
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,010
You and him

103
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,530
have such a close relationship.

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,810
Go and talk to him.

105
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,500
-No way.
-Then...

106
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,500
Why not?

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,120
You have a great relationship.

108
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,750
Why would you just leave it there

109
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,440
to collect dust?

110
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,380
There are many promotional methods.

111
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,170
It's not just Lidu that can do it.

112
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,980
The case is settled.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
There's no need to discuss further.

114
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,610
I—

115
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,600
You're dressed formally today.

116
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,180
It's enough to attend a wedding.

117
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,950
A baby's one month celebration is important.

118
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,470
If a product is a child,

119
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,720
then you're the dad

120
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,230
and Ms. Jiang

121
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,810
is the mom.

122
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,150
Watch your language.

123
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,180
It’s Baoxing and Teng Yue.

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,980
Look at me.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm like a product

126
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,810
waiting to be sold for the best price.

127
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,590
The nature of the workplace

128
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,540
is just value and transaction.

129
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,300
Boss, are you satisfied

130
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,130
with how I am now?

131
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,570
Are you nervous?

132
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,990
It's not my first livestream.

133
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,980
I'm nervous.

134
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,750
This is Teng Yue's

135
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,040
first official livestream.

136
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,170
I can see that.

137
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,350
Look,

138
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,470
it's written all over your face.

139
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,130
Why is your face swollen?

140
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
My face doesn't matter.

141
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,220
Teng Yue's first battle

142
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,350
depends on you.

143
00:07:59,250 --> 00:07:59,800
You can do it.

144
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,990
We're all behind you,

145
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,590
supporting you.

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
You have to trust us too.

147
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,670
Okay.

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,160
Have you finished the motivating speech?

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,310
One more thing.

150
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,770
Thank you.

151
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,900
You don't have to thank me.

152
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,960
I'll try my best,

153
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,890
not only for Teng Yue,

154
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,660
but also because I want to prove myself.

155
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,530
Well,

156
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,330
I'll go get ready.

157
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,990
Do you want to take a rest?

158
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,900
I'll go down soon.

159
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,710
For the past few days,

160
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,190
I've accompanied meals, drinking, and entertainment.

161
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,010
I've done every PR tactic I could,

162
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,990
but no one is here at this critical moment.

163
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,840
What is this?

164
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,400
We need to calm down now.

165
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,920
No one can guess

166
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,970
what Teng Yue will be like

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,010
after today.

168
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,020
There's only one word.

169
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,910
Tragic.

170
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,080
Come on in.

171
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,570
This way please.

172
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,130
Please come in.

173
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,130
Have a seat.

174
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,110
Come, come.

175
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,880
Please come in.

176
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,320
Master Zhang, help me greet them

177
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,370
The place is a bit shabby,

178
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,150
but

179
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,750
the main thing is

180
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,470
that today,

181
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,610
our design director

182
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,040
will share

183
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,940
her design concept

184
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,490
with everyone, okay?

185
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,630
Come, have a seat.

186
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,860
Take the gift.

187
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,530
Take the gift.

188
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,910
It's just a few nobodies.

189
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,780
Stop lying to yourself.

190
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,340
The show hasn't started yet.

191
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,150
This...

192
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,560
You can't succeed so easily,

193
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,110
right?

194
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,810
We need to keep calm

195
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,010
and have a healthier mindset.

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,250
Teng Yue's first livestream sales

390
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,060
are through the roof.

391
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,980
How is that possible?

392
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,140
Look.

393
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,290
In an hour, they reached

394
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,620
more than 10,000 pairs in presales.

395
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,070
I underestimated Jiang Hu.

396
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:31,650
Mr. Fang.

397
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,380
Tell them

398
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
the meeting will be held in three hours.

399
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,670
Okay.

400
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,630
I really like this kind of Chinese-style design.

401
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,230
Yeah.

402
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,530
I love it too.

403
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,890
I must collect

404
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,440
all three products in this line.

405
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,990
How many feet do you have?

406
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,260
You're going to buy three pairs at once?

407
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,560
Bro,

408
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,790
these are canvas shoes.

409
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,480
You can't expect to

410
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
wear one pair forever.

411
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,030
Done. Three orders have been placed.

412
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,730
No way.

413
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,480
You're going to fight with me for this too?

414
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,870
Not bad.

415
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,830
Mr. Gao.

416
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,690
It's okay. Keep watching.

417
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,070
Looks like your company

418
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,800
is really young and energetic.

419
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,690
We need new innovations.

420
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,310
It's really good.

421
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,420
Please wait.

422
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,430
My dear Mr. Fang,

423
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,990
you're here.

424
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,600
Hello.

425
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,610
What took you so long?

426
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,120
Sorry

427
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,890
for being late.

428
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,170
I just came back from Suzhou.

429
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,870
No, no, no.

430
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,070
It's our honor to have you here.

431
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,180
Isn't that Mr. Fang?

432
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,950
He's the biggest distributor

433
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,420
for Aneda.

434
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,190
See?

435
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,790
Even Fang is here.

436
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,220
Teng Yue is getting better and better.

437
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,090
Why don't we add more?

438
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,170
-Of course.
-Okay.

439
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,080
Good.

440
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,750
Thank you.

441
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,430
Jiang Hu isn't here?

442
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,050
She had an emergency.

443
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,920
How about I take you

444
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,070
on a tour?

445
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,600
Thank you.

446
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,350
Come on.

447
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,890
After you.

448
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,670
Let me introduce it to you.

449
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,370
Okay.

450
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,190
He only came after the livestream is over.

451
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,310
He must be anxious after seeing our sales

452
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,060
and rushed over to place an order.

453
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,850
Here.

454
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,360
This is new.

455
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,080
This is wool fabric

456
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,080
and cushions with castor oil.

457
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,420
Not bad.

458
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,730
It's completely Chinese fashion.

459
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,970
Are you feeling better?

460
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,500
Zhaoyang?

461
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,210
I was about to contact you.

462
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,540
You two can chat.

463
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,210
Make it short.

464
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,380
She needs more rest.

465
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,410
How are you?

466
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,070
I'm fine.

467
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,570
How was the livestream?

468
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,050
Blooming with Each Step

469
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,800
sold 62,328 pairs,

470
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,590
while Victory

471
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,440
1920 upgraded edition

472
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,030
only sold 1,009 pairs.

473
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,740
It proves that

474
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,890
your plan was right.

475
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,980
I was wrong.

476
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,030
You made both lines.

477
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,620
I remember back then,

478
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,840
when we had a running race,

479
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,420
you deliberately tied with me.

480
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,690
Did you expect

481
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:03,950
that this would happen?

482
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,620
You noticed?

483
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,790
I was just surprised back then

484
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,890
and I suspected it

485
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,360
because I never thought

486
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,630
that you would choose

487
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,810
this kind of compromise.

488
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,630
After all,

489
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,600
the Jiang Hu I knew

490
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,860
was

491
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,650
competitive

492
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,070
and never gave in.

493
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,470
I had no choice.

494
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,200
If we stayed

495
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,640
at a stalemate in that situation,

496
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,740
it wouldn't have done anyone any good.

497
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,480
Suggesting a race

498
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,340
was because I didn't want

499
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,580
you to hold a grudge,

500
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,110
because I value

501
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,220
our cooperation.

502
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,800
As for not winning the race,

503
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,030
it's because I wanted you to

504
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,630
see the final result with your own eyes.

505
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
I hope you can trust my judgment

506
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,880
in future decisions.

507
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,980
You have achieved your goal.

508
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,080
I will

509
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,470
continue to support

510
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,060
your marketing plan

511
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,560
and continue making

512
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,390
the next Chinese-style line.

513
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,510
Zhaoyang,

514
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,100
thank you.

515
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,170
Also, I promise

516
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,240
that after Teng Yue stabilizes its market,

517
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,480
you will have more freedom

518
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,310
in your designs.

519
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,150
Jiang Hu,

520
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,700
you

521
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,520
really changed a lot.

522
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,320
Here.

523
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,990
Everything you want is inside.

524
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,410
Also,

525
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,330
you owe me a meal.

526
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,750
It was so difficult

527
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,800
to take it

528
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,340
from Ms. Jiang's office.

529
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,070
Ms. Yue thought I was a creep.

530
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,500
Fine.

531
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,700
Thank you.

532
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,160
Don't thank me. Don't forget.

533
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,360
Also,

534
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,270
boss,

535
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,710
are you

536
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,070
taking advantage of her illness?

537
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,240
Head back.

538
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,070
Don't forget my meal.

539
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,380
When you

540
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,130
have to break through dead ends

541
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,650
and do everything possible,

542
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,810
you will change yourself

543
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,860
according to the situation.

544
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,320
By the way,

545
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,790
Fang from

546
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,640
Fang Trader's Circle today...

547
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,450
Are you done?

548
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,150
The nurse is here to pull out the needle.

549
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,030
What did you say about Fang?

550
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,440
Nothing.

551
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,530
Get some rest.

552
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,440
We'll talk about this

553
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,260
when you're working.

554
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,530
Take care of her.

555
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,110
This month's sales

556
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:01,670
from the flagship store

557
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,740
can't even be compared

558
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,340
to how much Teng Yue sold in one livestream.

559
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,030
Why don't we put this season's new products

560
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,220
into the market in advance?

561
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,620
We can steal

562
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,680
some attention from Teng Yue.

563
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,310
You can make a marketing plan

564
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,570
with the Sales Department.

565
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,600
The more I think about it, the more upset I am.

566
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,150
Xiang Zhaoyang should be

567
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,470
Free Unicorn's designer.

568
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,200
Jiang Hu

569
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,510
got many talents for Teng Yue.

570
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,610
Jiang Hu and I

571
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,190
have the same eye for talents.

572
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,090
You're more familiar with Teng Yue.

573
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,200
Go and get an idea

574
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,680
of who she has

575
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,860
that are more suitable to come to Free Unicorn.

576
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,360
Try to meet their requests.

577
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,240
Are you kidding?

578
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,920
Poach them first

579
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,100
and we'll naturally find a solution later.

580
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:14,440
[Outpatient]

581
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,510
Thank you.

582
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,720
I have to trouble you again

583
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,750
to send me back to Teng Yue.

584
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,070
Oh, please.

585
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,090
You've tormented me the entire day

586
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,150
and now, you want me to drive you across the river.

587
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,140
I'm exhausted.

588
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,900
Then, I'll take a taxi home.

589
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,160
What taxi?

590
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,630
If you

591
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,740
faint in the car again,

592
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,760
you'll be blackmailing me.

593
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,660
Fasten your seatbelt.

594
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,710
Did you forget?

595
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,050
My home is

596
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,640
on the next street.

597
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,270
It's really close.

598
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,389
Your house?

599
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:23,940
Come in.

600
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,820
I don't think it's a good idea.

601
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,889
I'd better go back.

602
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,110
We have a meeting tomorrow morning.

603
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,530
What are you going back for?

604
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,590
Your inflammation hasn't recovered yet.

605
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,800
Your cheeks are still swollen.

606
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,699
Why are you having a meeting?

607
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,530
Still, I can't stay at your house.

608
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,719
I didn't bring anything.

609
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,639
Why not?

610
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,370
Change your shoes first.

611
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,750
They're all here.

612
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,550
Wow.

613
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,390
When did you get these?

614
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,350
Your uncle thought you would be hospitalized,

615
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,700
so he asked Wu Guanglei to bring them over.

616
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,500
Well,

617
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,830
I don't have pajamas either.

618
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,770
Isn't this good

619
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,670
for pajamas?

620
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,470
It's quite suitable.

621
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,480
Then, I'll stay here

622
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,500
and trouble you for a night.

623
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,460
I'll send you back to Teng Yue

624
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,640
after you recover.

625
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,400
No way.

626
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,550
Why not?

627
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,410
It'll take at least three or four days.

628
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,290
Then you can go back in three or four days.

629
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,750
If you go back now,

630
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
there's no one to take care of you.

631
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,200
But I'm not familiar with you.

632
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,270
It's weird to live in your house.

633
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,200
Jiang Hu, as I said,

634
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,820
I have to show

635
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,610
sincerity

636
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,110
when wooing a girl.

637
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,900
What I'm doing now

638
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,230
is showing my sincerity,

639
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,870
so please respect it

640
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,530
and me,

641
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,230
okay?

642
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,430
Change your shoes

643
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,460
and take a rest in the living room.

644
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,340
I'll go upstairs to my bedroom

645
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,570
and clean it up for you.

646
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,120
Your bedroom?

647
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,210
Where will you sleep?

648
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,160
In the study.

649
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,560
♫You say the wind picks up♫

650
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,590
♫I close my eyes♫

651
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,650
♫In the air♫

652
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,800
♫I smell regret and nostalgia♫

653
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,540
♫Innocent promises♫

654
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,950
♫Ups and downs♫

655
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,830
♫I just wish to move on♫

656
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,510
♫I know it has all ended♫

657
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,940
♫Like a fulcrum♫

658
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,360
♫It's making time tilt♫

659
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,770
♫In flashbacks♫

660
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,920
♫I see us again♫

661
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,150
♫That adventurous summer with you♫

662
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,990
♫It was not just a season♫

663
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,690
♫The flowers in my heart bloomed♫

664
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,850
♫Firm, romantic and quiet♫

665
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,740
♫They withered♫

666
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,020
♫You said in this world♫

667
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,650
♫There are cloudy days and sunny days♫

668
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,150
♫Your bright face♫

669
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,100
♫Is like a sun but it's fading away♫

670
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,370
♫Waving goodbye♫

671
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,920
♫It's not just a period of time that I say goodbye to♫

672
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:01,980
♫But also my youth♫

673
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,980
My Little Butterfly,

674
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,110
the sun is up.

675
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,040
Why aren't you up yet?

676
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,370
♫The world and I♫

677
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,410
Hurry and get up.

678
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,080
♫Reconcile and fall in love at the moment♫

679
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,400
♫Because I'm using my fingers♫

680
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,300
♫To chase the wind and your smile♫

681
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,290
♫When the wind reveals what I miss♫

682
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,230
♫When I realize this is love♫

683
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,310
♫You're already gone♫

684
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,510
Dad,

685
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,300
I'm thirsty.

686
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,540
♫The boy who runs towards me with the wind♫

687
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,920
♫Just to catch up♫

688
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,210
♫With me♫

689
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,390
♫Why did I turn around and find♫

690
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,530
♫Only fallen leaves are left♫

691
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,980
♫Rolling in the air alone♫

692
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,970
♫Like an unsigned letter♫

693
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,640
♫Nowhere to be sent to♫

694
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,540
♫I have to keep writing♫

695
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,690
♫Slowly, affectionately, and quietly♫

696
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,460
♫Writing♫

697
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,130
♫The world and I♫

698
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,010
♫Reconcile and fall in love at the moment♫

699
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,120
♫Because I'm using my fingers♫

700
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:27,030
♫To chase the wind and your smile♫

701
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,780
♫When the wind reveals what I miss♫

702
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,820
♫When I realize this is love♫

703
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,250
♫You're already gone♫

704
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:45,780
You're up?

705
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:46,990
Morning.

706
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,630
Morning.

707
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,360
Come sit down and have breakfast.

708
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,040
Did you make all these?

709
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,830
Yes.

710
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,330
I got up early to make it.

711
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm at least a bit better

712
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,570
than you

713
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,980
in cooking.

714
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,540
Did you bring this shirt here

715
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,570
on purpose yesterday?

716
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,120
For what?

717
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,350
Purposely

718
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,370
bring your shirt over

719
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,010
so we can have couple pajamas?

720
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,760
Yes, I did it on purpose.

721
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,510
At least we have the same taste

722
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,680
for home clothes.

723
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,550
I've never seen someone so shameless before.

724
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,510
I can't become your boyfriend

725
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,500
if I'm not shameless enough.

726
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,920
What's wrong today?

727
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,000
Why are you so nice all of a sudden?

728
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,060
Did your brain get messed up

729
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,920
from the fever?

730
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,160
Thank you.

731
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,000
Thank you.

732
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,950
Honey, are you up?

733
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,310
I bought you

734
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,070
your favorite steamed buns.

735
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,040
Well...

736
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,030
You two...

737
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,400
You...

738
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,440
You two...

739
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,170
Go on.

740
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,390
Continue.

741
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,700
I'm leaving.

742
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,350
Well,

743
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,370
I'll put the breakfast here.

744
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,750
Go on.

745
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,100
Like what you saw?

746
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,010
You came with perfect timing.

747
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,110
I also think that I came

748
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,090
at the right time.
