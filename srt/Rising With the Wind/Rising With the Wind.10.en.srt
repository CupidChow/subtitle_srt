00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,690
You still have 24 days,

194
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,610
6 hours, and 1 minute

195
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,230
to fulfill your promise.

196
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,530
I hope you can cherish

197
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,210
every minute

198
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,490
you've earned.

199
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,740
I know. I understand.

200
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,370
Don't worry.

201
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,430
20,000 pairs.

202
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,250
Wait and see.

203
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,850
It's something made in Hong Kong.

204
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,870
Lend me your car, okay?

205
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,320
Go.

206
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,440
One, two, three. Go.

207
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,740
One, two, three. Go.

208
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,790
Okay.

209
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,210
Thank you.

210
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,710
Hello?

211
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,730
I've borrowed a car.

212
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,120
And I'll fix the loudspeaker

213
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,030
soon.

214
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,850
Don't worry.

215
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,360
Okay.

216
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,780
Thank you.

217
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,440
Remove this? Are you sure?

218
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,890
Yes.

219
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,320
That's where the problem is.

220
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,850
This is not right.

221
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,270
If I remove this,

222
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,660
where can I find

223
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,250
a new one for it?

224
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,590
I can

225
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,090
find one here

226
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,200
and deliver it to you.

227
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,510
It's gonna take about...

228
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,180
a week.

229
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
A week?

230
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,410
No.

231
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,620
Then you can only

232
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,310
find an old loudspeaker to dismantle it.

233
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,510
But no other loudspeakers

234
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,670
are as old as this one, right?

235
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,190
Your loudspeaker will do.

236
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,900
I can teach you how to dismantle it.

237
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,030
Xu Si.

238
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,360
Are you up?

239
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,950
Are you up?

240
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,910
Coming.

241
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,680
Didn't you just buy this loudspeaker?

242
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,820
Why did you dismantle it?

243
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,940
Are you so free on the weekend?

244
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,760
You still like to dismantle home appliances

245
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,870
like when you were a kid?

246
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,350
More or less.

247
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,250
If your mom knows,

248
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,290
you'll be doomed.

249
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,390
I can restore it.

250
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you want to try on the new clothes I bought for you?

251
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,550
Put them upstairs for me.

252
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,350
I'll try them on later.

253
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,280
Okay, I'm gonna hang them up for you.

254
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,890
Tell me the truth.

255
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,860
Xu.

256
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,710
Si.

257
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,940
X. S.

258
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,800
The initials of your name.

259
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,500
I don't think you did it yourself.

260
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,490
Do you have a new girlfriend?

261
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,620
You're so imaginative.

262
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,950
If she's not your new girlfriend,

263
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,050
why does she know your size?

264
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,110
She bought you clothes and embroidered your name's initials.

265
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,710
Can you

266
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,980
stop paying all your attention

267
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,510
to your work every day?

268
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,500
Do you plan to spend the rest of your life

269
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,330
with your work?

270
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,690
I think she is good.

271
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,470
She's very attentive.

272
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,650
Yes.

273
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,040
Because she wanted to bribe me.

274
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,990
What?

275
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,460
What bribe?

276
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,950
I think

277
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,350
my flowers are working.

278
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,900
I'm going to take a look.

279
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,020
Aunt.

280
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,190
Aunt.

281
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,770
My flowers were growing well.

282
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,270
Why have they withered at your place?

283
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,220
When can you

284
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,020
learn to keep plants alive?

285
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,490
Aunt,

286
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,230
do you have

287
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,320
easier-to-care-for flowers?

288
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,710
Tell me

289
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,890
what you mean by "easier-to-care-for flowers".

290
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,110
Flowers that require little sunshine,

291
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,630
little water,

292
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,110
and low maintenance.

293
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,690
They can grow well on their own.

294
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,250
Something like that.

295
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
You don't even want to make the slightest effort to grow flowers.

296
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,430
You wish.

297
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,290
You know this.

298
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,790
I...

299
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,580
can't keep these troublesome things.

300
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,340
Listen.

301
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,690
The flowers are really effective.

302
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,140
Did you drive today?

303
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,580
Yes.

304
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,200
Great.

305
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,960
Take me to a place later.

306
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,430
Where's your car?

307
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,980
I want you to take me to get my car.

308
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,090
Five, six, seven, eight.

309
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,250
Good.

310
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,710
The rhythm.

311
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,510
Your legs.

312
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,260
Good.

313
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,180
Five, six, seven, eight.

314
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,990
Nice.

315
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,530
You're dancing well.

316
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,710
Du,

317
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
I really don't know

318
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,870
how to praise you.

319
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,000
Modesty helps one make progress.

320
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,270
Conceit makes one lag behind.

321
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,990
Is the loudspeaker okay?

322
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,890
You're so shameless.

323
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,420
Good.

324
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,870
You're dancing well.

325
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,990
You're dancing well.

326
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,470
You're loyal.

327
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,990
About selling shoes,

328
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,250
we'll discuss it carefully after we go back to the factory.

329
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,630
Sure. Anytime.

330
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,220
You borrowed my car

331
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,870
and asked me to fix the loudspeaker

332
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,190
just

333
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,730
to let those ladies do square dancing.

334
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,720
Is this your job?

335
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,350
Yes.

336
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,860
It's very effective, right?

337
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,070
Effective?

338
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,930
You plan to sell those shoes

339
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,450
to these ladies.

340
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,119
At least 20 people there

341
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,000
will wear Teng Yue's shoes.

342
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,200
Good for you.

343
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,770
You don't have to be sarcastic.

344
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,339
The 2 blocks here

345
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,069
have 9 housing estates.

346
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,560
There are 18 dance teams in total.

347
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,030
Each dance team

348
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,359
has at least 20 members.

349
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,910
Everyone

350
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,440
has 2 or 3

351
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,849
WeChat groups with their friends and relatives.

352
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,430
Each group

353
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,760
has at least 20 members.

354
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,119
I will make each of them

355
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,290
wear Teng Yue's shoes.

356
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,150
Great.

357
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,310
You have found

358
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,090
the private traffic of 20,000 people.

359
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,860
Have you joined those groups?

360
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,950
I will join the groups soon.

361
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,770
I think I can get it done

362
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,880
after talking to Mr. Du tonight.

363
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,470
Thank you

364
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,380
for your help this time.

365
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,470
I'll treat you to a meal

366
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,140
after I earn money.

367
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,880
Then I guess I have to wait

368
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,160
a little longer for the meal.

369
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,620
What do you mean?

370
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,110
Sometimes, it looks like

371
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
you have solved the problem.

372
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,640
But in fact, you haven't.

373
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,670
Do you

374
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,950
want to go back on your word

375
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,550
because

376
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,390
the 20,000 pairs of shoes will be sold out soon?

377
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,160
You are throwing a wet blanket on my enthusiasm.

378
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,030
Do you really believe what he said?

379
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,730
I don't want to talk to you.

380
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,940
Where are you going?

381
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,910
You made me upset.

382
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,870
I'm going to find a place to calm down.

383
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,040
First,

384
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,210
you borrowed my car.

385
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,590
I don't allow you

386
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,310
to abandon my car.

387
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,570
Second,

388
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,790
do you really plan to let me

389
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,370
watch those ladies dancing alone?

390
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,790
What do you think?

391
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,720
We'll watch them dancing together.

392
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,750
Rascal.

393
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,520
Let's drink.

394
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:51,870
Come on.

395
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,470
Drink.

396
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,750
Drink.

397
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
I didn't expect

398
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,330
that there are investors like Mr. Xu

399
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,870
who doesn't like drinking.

400
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,690
So

401
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,170
having a meal with him is quite boring.

402
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,980
It doesn't matter if we drink or not.

403
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,990
What matters most is

404
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,360
if our collaboration

405
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,150
is successful or not.

406
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,370
Mr. Xu, well said.

407
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,890
I didn't expect Cloud Footwear

408
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,160
to refuse

409
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,140
our acquisition offer.

410
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,200
As for the alternative,

411
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,550
I hope your team

412
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,730
can start to work on it as soon as possible.

413
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,180
I'm already making arrangements.

414
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,530
Great.

415
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,520
Come on.

416
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,590
Let's have another drink.

417
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,340
Come on.

418
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,180
To Mr. Xu.

419
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,510
[Teng Yue Shoes]

420
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,260
Jun,

421
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,150
give me some sunflower seeds.

422
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,020
Here.

423
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,500
Master Zhang,

424
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,740
do you think

425
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,360
that big dealer can really bring us

426
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,710
a lot of orders?

427
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,650
I'm not sure.

428
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,170
We've been waiting

429
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,250
since before dusk.

430
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,640
We haven't seen anyone.

431
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,560
I think he's unreliable.

432
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,130
That's right.

433
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,680
What should we do?

434
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,190
Can you shut up?

435
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,540
Well...

436
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,730
Ms. Jiang,

437
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,970
I'm here.

438
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,390
-This man?
-This man?

439
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,870
Mr. Du promised to help me sell shoes.

440
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,190
It's a good thing.

441
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,710
But he asked for 200,000 yuan

442
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,990
for public relations expenses.

443
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,470
He said he needs to establish

444
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,470
connections in channels like supermarkets

445
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,710
and grocery stores.

446
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,000
200,000 yuan?

447
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,130
He's quite sophisticated.

448
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,520
You can't

449
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,510
make a hasty decision.

450
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,600
Why is it so hard

451
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,160
to do our own business?

452
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,270
I never thought

453
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,150
I wouldn't be able to sleep

454
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,790
just for 20,000 pairs of shoes.

455
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,690
The beginning is always the hardest in everything.

456
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,110
Were you like this

457
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,900
when you ran an online store?

458
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,450
Give me that pincer.

459
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,850
Our store

460
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,350
is named "Xixingji".

461
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:16,810
It's not just because

462
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,000
there are

463
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,790
four of us.

464
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,110
I thought in doing business,

465
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,130
it's inevitable to face many difficulties.

466
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,990
So we

467
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,760
started a business with the spirit of obtaining Buddhist sutras.

468
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,840
I don't know

469
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,150
if I can stick with it.

470
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,100
Let me sell them.

471
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,070
You?

472
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,610
Let Xixingji

473
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,620
help sell Teng Yue's shoes.

474
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,910
I'll put them on the homepage.

475
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,870
What if Jiu and the others

476
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,810
have a problem with that?

477
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,970
They won't.

478
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,020
But...

479
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,370
But now,

480
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,440
I don't have that much money

481
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,780
to pay you in advance.

482
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,230
Forget about the money.

483
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,670
It's my store. I have the final say.

484
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,330
We'll talk about it

485
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
when you have money.

486
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,400
Yang.

487
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,560
Alright, it's a deal.

488
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,550
It's almost done.

489
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,870
Try it.

490
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,270
Thank you.

491
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,190
Impressive.

492
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,200
Yeah, I can do a lot of things.

493
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,550
You didn't charge the operating fees.

494
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,050
And you put the shoes on the homepage.

495
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,420
You're falling step by step,

496
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,080
Boss.

497
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,170
Do you owe her money

498
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,910
or a favor?

499
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,610
Jiang Hu is really having a hard time.

500
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,480
Go work for her for free.

501
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,150
I can do that.

502
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,510
I'm a man

503
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,690
of loyalty.

504
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,350
Loyalty?

505
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,950
Give me back the money you owe me.

506
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,160
This is not necessary.

507
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,550
Jiang Hu

508
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,340
fishes for sympathy as long as she has a chance.

509
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,380
And she keeps doing it.

510
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,280
Really.

511
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,360
She just won't stop.

512
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,370
It's hard to guard against her.

513
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,470
Jiang Hu said

514
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,280
she won't occupy our place.

515
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,570
Teng Yue

516
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,460
will pack and ship the goods.

517
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,420
Wu will be responsible

518
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,190
for Teng Yue's things in the future.

519
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:17,970
Okay.

520
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,140
Since you have agreed,

521
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,360
I can only agree with you.

522
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,420
Well.

523
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,430
Several days ago, who said

524
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,790
Teng Yue's shoes are not saleable,

525
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,050
the styles are old-fashioned,

526
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,380
and rubber-soled shoes

527
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,500
don't have high quality?

528
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,450
What about your firm standpoint,

529
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,050
Jiu?

530
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,780
What era is it now?

531
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,450
Why do I need a standpoint?

532
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,240
Go. Go.

533
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,040
Go back to work.

534
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,440
Clean the table. Go.

535
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,410
No.

536
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,350
You should go.

537
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,930
You have to go.

538
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,240
Well...

539
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,790
Come on.

540
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,390
Go clean the table.

541
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:47,790
Don't touch me.

542
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,150
Hurry.

543
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,390
Let go. Let go.

544
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,270
Stop talking. Go.

545
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,390
I don't want to do it.

546
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,080
What do you plan to say

547
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,260
to Zhaoyang?

548
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,790
She and Jiang Hu

549
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,270
don't get along with each other.

550
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,410
That's what I'm worried about.

551
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,210
Back then,

552
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,400
I promised Jiang Hu rashly.

553
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,420
I can't go back on my word, right?

554
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,020
Let me tell you.

555
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,910
Through my observation,

556
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
I don't think

557
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,770
Jiang Hu is simple.

558
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,110
I owe her a favor.

559
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,130
I'm willing to help her this time.

560
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,170
But we can't

561
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,680
let Zhaoyang know.

562
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,070
Especially Qi,

563
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,970
who is not a tight-lipped person.

564
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,080
Tell them to be careful.

565
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,520
Don't worry.

566
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,600
I'll tell them.

567
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,220
Get ready.

568
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,680
Three, two, one.

569
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,500
Very good.

570
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,850
Lift your tiptoes.

571
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,130
Good.

572
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,470
Okay.

573
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,080
Come on. Turn towards this direction.

574
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,140
Bring the lights here.

575
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,360
Come on.

576
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,120
Ms. Jiang,

577
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,900
show both of your feet.

578
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,830
Very good.

579
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,670
Three, two, one.

580
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,630
One more.

581
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,790
Here, have a drink.

582
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,610
Thank you.

583
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,710
Hello?

584
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,590
I know. We'll be there this afternoon.

585
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,170
How many parcels?

586
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,100
One?

587
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,760
Just one?

588
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,320
Okay.

589
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,870
Zhang Sheng.

590
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,610
Take care of him.

591
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,140
Look at him.

592
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,900
Okay.

593
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,660
Focus.

594
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,290
[Countdown to 15 days]

595
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,500
[Countdown to 14 days]

596
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,880
[Countdown to 13 days]

597
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,860
[Countdown to 12 days]

598
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,360
[Countdown to 11 days]

599
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,440
[Countdown to 10 days]

600
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,910
[Countdown to 09 days]

601
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,610
What should we do?

602
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,840
We'll talk about it later.

603
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,890
Mr. Pei.

604
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,320
What?

605
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,900
Where is Ms. Jiang?

606
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,410
She went to sell shoes.

607
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,560
What's the matter?

608
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
She should give us

609
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,020
our wages for this month, right?

610
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,470
Yeah.

611
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:23,950
That's right.

612
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,120
Wages?

613
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,560
What wages?

614
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,610
Did you work this month?

615
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,160
No, right?

616
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:32,870
Right?

617
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,600
Do you think you worked

618
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,590
just by moving those boxes?

619
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,000
Yet you are here asking for wages.

620
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,480
And you are gathering here

621
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
to make a fuss.

622
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,950
Listen.

623
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,030
When the production lines are up and running,

624
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,950
you can get your wages.

625
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,730
Pei,

626
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,390
considering what you said,

627
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,990
you're being unreasonable.

628
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,920
Yes, you are being unreasonable.

629
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,970
You want me to reason with you.

630
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,080
Then who will reason with me?

631
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,720
Listen.

632
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,660
If we can't sell out of the inventory,

633
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,510
we can't make any money.

634
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,870
If we can't make any money,

635
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,370
the factory will

636
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,930
be shut down.

637
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,100
Pei,

638
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,300
we'll talk about future matters when the time comes.

639
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,040
Now,

640
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,950
we are still

641
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,590
Teng Yue's workers.

642
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,370
Yes.

643
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,530
You have to pay on time.

644
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,440
It's illegal if you don't pay.

645
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,860
Yes.

646
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,250
We can

647
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,580
resort to labor arbitration.

648
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,300
We can sue you. I'm telling you.

649
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,090
Sue me?

650
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,560
You scared me.

651
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,960
You scared me.

652
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,250
Where are you going?

653
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,930
Pei, where are you going?

654
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,910
Pay us.

655
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,850
Where are you going?

656
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,480
Xiang Zhaoyang is still on leave.

657
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,850
So you asked me here

658
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,280
to watch over the place today?

659
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,560
I hope

660
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,830
you can help me persuade her.

661
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,170
She is an influencer who has signed a contract with you.

662
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,610
But you discovered her.

663
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,130
I guess

664
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,830
only you can persuade her.

665
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,160
She's having a go-slow to express her discontent.

666
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,990
She's having a conflict with the company.

667
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,260
You're too modest.

668
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,820
She is not satisfied

669
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,720
with your way of solving the problem, right?

670
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,000
I did

671
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,830
what you told me to do.

672
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,820
I asked you to resolve the conflict,

673
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,680
not to make things worse.

674
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,390
Xiang Zhaoyang is unsociable.

675
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,250
She's too stubborn.

676
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,120
She's not like Nan.

677
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,500
Nan is sensible and thoughtful.

678
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,640
Nan compromised as soon as I said it.

679
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,290
Song Zhi,

680
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,180
it's been 3-4 years since you started a business.

681
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,400
Every time you encounter a problem,

682
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,810
you would choose to avoid it.

683
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,110
That's why you

684
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,910
can never make further progress

685
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,890
in your business.

686
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,280
Send me Xiang Zhaoyang's home address

687
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,540
that was registered

688
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,400
when she was admitted.

689
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,600
I'll buy

690
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,970
the rest of the shoes.

691
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,850
No.

692
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,870
We are friends.

693
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,870
But this is business.

694
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,140
I really can't ask for more.

695
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,770
And I heard from Jiu

696
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,460
that you have a batch of stink prevention eco socks

697
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,040
in your warehouse.

698
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,000
They have been there for over 6 months.

699
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,320
If Jiu knows

700
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,700
you cover expenses for Teng Yue,

701
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,860
he will kill me.

702
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,590
Let's be flexible.

703
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,170
I don't have that much money.

704
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,840
I'll ask some friends to help.

705
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,460
Let's fool Xu first.

706
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,200
After renting the factory,

707
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,160
we'll figure out a way

708
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,830
to sell those shoes.

709
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,620
I've tried this method.

710
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,000
If I use it again,

711
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,270
he'll definitely know.

712
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,030
Xu Si is smart.

713
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,440
Why is he doing this?

714
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,720
It's not like you don't want to pay the rent of the factory.

715
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,990
Him?

716
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,220
He is

717
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,210
a cunning investor.

718
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,950
He's testing me.

719
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,240
Do you think

720
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,630
this is just a matter of shoes and money?

721
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,490
He wants me to prove

722
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,280
that I have the ability to make Teng Yue better

723
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,990
and

724
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,630
pay the rent in 1 year.

725
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,110
Boss.

726
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:46,790
Look.

727
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,350
This is a new product.

728
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,980
If we buy a box of what we always bought,

729
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,650
we can get a bottle of this new product free of charge.

730
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,790
I really think this new product is good.

731
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,070
The point is it's really suitable.

732
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,470
Jiang Hu, why don't you...

733
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,420
try it?

734
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,640
She's thinking about something.

735
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,140
Why are you looking at me?

736
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,320
It's creepy.

737
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,420
I have an idea.

738
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,550
If no one wants to buy the shoes,

739
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,480
we can just give them to someone.

740
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,920
What do you mean?

741
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,110
Giving 20,000 pairs of shoes

742
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,900
is much easier

743
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,160
than selling 20,000 pairs of shoes, right?

744
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,550
You're crazy.

745
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
You don't want to make profits?

746
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,020
What if I can make profits by giving those shoes?

747
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,200
Jiu,

748
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,360
how much

749
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,510
does a pair of stink prevention eco socks

750
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,450
in your warehouse cost?

751
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,720
I remember each pair costs 58 yuan.

752
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,570
Yes.

753
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,800
How many pairs are there?

754
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,980
There are 12,000 pairs.

755
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,850
How much is the cost?

756
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,750
Ten yuan.

757
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,670
Wang said

758
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,630
it was not easy

759
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,690
to get the patent.

760
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,070
He's stubborn.

761
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,430
He insisted on

762
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,900
setting the price at 58 yuan.

763
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,510
Otherwise, it would affect the brand image.

764
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,230
They have been in my warehouse for quite some time.

765
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,430
It's a long-standing problem.

766
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,620
Don't think about it.

767
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,710
I have already given up.

768
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,100
What if

769
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,240
I can sell all your socks

770
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,540
at the set price?

771
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,290
Are you okay?

772
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,150
Buy a pair of

773
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,280
stink prevention eco socks priced at 58 yuan,

774
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,080
get a pair of Teng Yue shoes

775
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,150
worth 79 yuan free.

776
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,410
Do you think this promotion

777
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,960
is very attractive?

778
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,480
Very attractive.

779
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:58,980
If I were them,

780
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,970
I would be the first to buy them.

781
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,630
It's worthwhile.

782
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,030
Okay.

783
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,050
Help me display it on the homepage.

784
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,150
With each pair of socks sold,

785
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,670
I'll give a pair of shoes.

786
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,780
Let's split the profits 50-50.

787
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,179
You'll give us money?

788
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,070
What's in it for you?

789
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,480
For each pair of socks,

790
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,460
I charge 58 yuan.

791
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,000
Minus the 10 yuan cost of socks,

792
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,380
the 20 yuan cost of shoes,

793
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:21,909
and the 5 yuan commission

794
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,770
for the sales staff

795
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,389
for selling

796
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,429
a set of

797
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,340
socks and shoes,

798
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,360
eventually,

799
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,040
by giving a pair of shoes,

800
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,949
I can make profits

801
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,679
of 23 yuan.

802
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,659
Isn't this good?

803
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,540
It's great.

804
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,699
Your idea is wonderful.

805
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,480
It's also feasible

806
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,070
in community supermarkets and grocery stores.

807
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,719
You can talk to them.

808
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,679
Looks like I should spend some money

809
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,420
and talk to Mr. Du.

810
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,350
But

811
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,760
he asked for 200,000 yuan.

812
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,460
You should think twice.

813
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,690
Mr. Xu.

814
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,740
Why are you here?

815
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,810
At 10 a.m. tomorrow,

816
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,280
go to Studio 1 of TT Media

817
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,240
to shoot a video for the second stage.

818
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,010
I'm still on leave.

819
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,390
Even if you'll be on leave till you retire at 60,

820
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,870
TT Media

821
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,990
won't punish Nan publicly.

822
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,000
Your threat is worthless.

823
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,660
Because he's currently the most popular host

824
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,710
of TT Media.

825
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
As for you, if you miss this opportunity,

826
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,090
maybe you can

827
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,890
never solve your financial problems

828
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,790
for the rest of your life.

829
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,040
And you'll have to offer TT Media a lot of money

830
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,300
as compensation for the breach of contract.

831
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,470
This is the reality.

832
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,590
I told you this

833
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,820
when I first saw you.

834
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,310
Make numerous people

835
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,270
stand behind you.

836
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,670
And you won't be bullied

837
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,410
so easily.

838
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,990
You're expressing your discontent.

839
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,390
No one can help you.

840
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,280
Before you do this next time,

841
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,740
think about

842
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,800
the problem you need to solve first.

843
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,290
I'll go to the company tomorrow.

844
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,890
Time is precious.

845
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,040
Don't easily waste

846
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,950
each other's time.

847
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,970
[Changle Restaurant]

848
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,870
We meet again.

849
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,470
Yes.

850
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,170
I didn't expect to see you here.

851
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,460
This wonton restaurant is nice.

852
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,400
I come here often.

853
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,480
I heard

854
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,890
you bought Teng Yue.

855
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,380
It will reopen soon.

856
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,440
I saw

857
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,540
your videos on the Internet.

858
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,450
They are not bad.

859
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,560
Yes.

860
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,520
I didn't expect

861
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,710
that great changes

862
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,540
have happened to both of us.

863
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,060
Xiang Zhaoyang,

864
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,840
I don't think

865
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,380
you should quit being a designer.

866
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,920
It's not a wise decision.

867
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,370
Do you think it's wise of you

868
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,440
to buy Teng Yue?

869
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,810
You have 7 days,

870
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,680
8 hours, and 17 minutes

871
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,750
to fulfill your promise.

872
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,460
Mr. Xu,

873
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,200
I know you have innate advantages

874
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,630
in numbers.

875
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,900
But my math

876
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,310
was not taught by my Physical Education teacher.

877
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,810
I can count

878
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,960
the numbers you said

879
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,340
with my fingers.

880
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,350
If you can't achieve your goal

881
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,030
by that time,

882
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,080
don't

883
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,470
be unreasonable again.

884
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,810
Just prepare the contract.

885
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,040
I'm just kindly reminding you

886
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,320
don't waste your time

887
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,330
on useless things.

888
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,270
What do you mean?

889
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,020
The loudspeaker has been fixed.

890
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,030
But it obviously didn't help you

891
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,430
get what you want.

892
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,480
Have you ever thought about

893
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,110
why he had such a ridiculous condition?

894
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,260
Maybe it's because

895
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,930
he can't

896
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,280
achieve the goal you set at all.

897
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,080
Could it be that

898
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,070
you chose the wrong direction from the beginning?

899
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,910
We're helping Jiang Hu sell shoes,

900
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,340
and Zhaoyang is not angry.

901
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,670
Isn't this a good thing?

902
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,690
That's right.

903
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,010
Sometimes being angry

904
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,620
is not necessarily a bad thing.

905
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,420
What do you mean?

906
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,130
What do you mean?

907
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,460
You don't understand, do you?

908
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,950
You, go clean the table in the room.

909
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,780
You, go sweep the floor in the room.

910
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,440
Go.

911
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,780
I have to say this

912
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,440
today.

913
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,730
Well.

914
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,220
All these years,

915
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,210
Zhaoyang has paid

916
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:23,910
all her attention

917
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,040
to the paintings she designed

918
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,070
and the problems

919
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,460
Aunt caused.

920
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,470
Everything

921
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,420
you did for her

922
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,880
is in vain.

923
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,870
We are brother and sister.

924
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,290
Why should I care so much?

925
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,820
You know what I mean.

926
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,690
Why are you back?

927
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,130
Can you help me ask about someone?

928
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,250
Hello.

929
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,520
I got the information.

930
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,430
I'm gonna tell you

931
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,180
what happened.

932
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,400
When

933
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,560
Du was young,

934
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,690
he enjoyed eating, but was lazy.

935
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,860
He even had a mistress.

936
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,800
Everything in his family

937
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,070
was taken care of by Song Jiali,

938
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,390
his ex-wife.

939
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,050
Back then,

940
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,830
20 years ago,

941
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,790
Song Jiali was very famous

942
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,070
in the fashion industry.

943
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,870
She was

944
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,450
a big shot.

945
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,670
Later, she divorced Du.

946
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,910
She went to another city with her daughter.

947
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,260
She came back after she retired.

948
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,630
After Du found out,

949
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,380
he asked her for money

950
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,450
including alimony.

951
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,580
That's why

952
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,020
what happened in the square happened.

953
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,070
Let's go home.

954
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,860
Ms. Song,

955
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,720
you are back from the vegetable market.

956
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,330
Yes.

957
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,160
Call her Grandma.

958
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,990
Hello, Grandma.

959
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,510
Hello. Good girl.

960
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,140
You're so polite.

961
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,510
Don't scare her.

962
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,340
I didn't expect

963
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,240
that you still remember me.

964
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,800
Of course I remember you.

965
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,390
When you were a kid,

966
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,260
your dad always took you with him

967
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,810
when he attended dealers' meetings.

968
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,360
I heard

969
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,100
you took over Teng Yue.

970
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,900
In the beginning,

971
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,480
it's difficult, right?

972
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:19,960
If Teng Yue

973
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,870
didn't become

974
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,870
the OEM of Free Unicorn,

975
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,740
it wouldn't have become

976
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,880
like this.

977
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,700
Come. You go home first.

978
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,770
When I was with that man,

979
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,350
I didn't save much money.

980
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,280
But I made a lot of friends.

981
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,180
I have some connections.

982
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,330
As long as I call

983
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,010
some supermarkets in the community

984
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,000
and small dealers,

985
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,070
they will do what they can to help.

986
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,020
You mean...

987
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,730
In the past,

988
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,620
your parents took good care of me,

989
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,700
especially your mother.

990
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,820
I think

991
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,010
she would be very happy

992
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,400
to see you make Teng Yue thrive again.

993
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:15,920
