00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,110
As investors,

6
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,539
our job is to

7
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,390
select people

8
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,200
who are valuable.

9
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,960
Do you mean that

10
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,670
someone like Ms. Jiang who squanders money

11
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,330
can make money for us?

12
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,289
Are we just going to do nothing

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
and wait for her to make miracles for us?

14
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,640
Uncle.

15
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,990
For last month's salary,

16
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,950
did you not pay the workers

17
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,710
according to their

18
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,669
usual wage standard?

19
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,690
There hasn't been any work for a month.

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
I was kind enough

21
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,860
to pay them half their wage.

22
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,350
Why didn't you

23
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,350
discuss it with me?

24
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,550
It'll be bad if I discussed it with you.

25
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,620
Once you give the command,

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,550
a lot of money

27
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,270
will be spent

28
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,620
like flowing water.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm saving money for you.

30
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,570
But you still can't do this.

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
We're almost out of work.

32
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,670
If you can't broaden the sources of income,

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,600
you have to cut costs.

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,240
You...

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,180
Why?

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,440
You're blaming me now, aren't you?

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm not blaming you.

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,630
I was negligent.

39
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,790
Jiang Hu.

40
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,270
I'm telling you, running a factory

41
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,390
is not as easy

42
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,460
as you think.

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,079
There are dozens of people and everyone has their own thoughts.

44
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,210
To manage all of them,

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,040
it's very frustrating.

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,829
Uncle.

47
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,460
I think everyone

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,080
listens to Liu Jun.

49
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,110
But isn't he Zhang Sheng's disciple?

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,440
Is Zhang Sheng the manager?

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,200
In the factory,

52
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,690
Zhang Sheng

53
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,940
has been devoted to

54
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,510
the craft of shoe lasts.

55
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,570
He doesn't care about anything else.

56
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,220
Since ten years ago,

57
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,500
he has already given up his managerial position

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,870
to Liu Jun.

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,720
He's not in charge.

60
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,560
Daily management.

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
Pei Zhiyuan.

62
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,540
Okay, I'll handle it for you.

63
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,140
Uncle.

64
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,370
What's Liu Jun like?

65
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,760
He’s good at work,

66
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,610
but he's not a good person.

67
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,030
Your dad and I got used to

68
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,740
working with him, I guess.

69
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,010
How does he fare when compared to Zhang Sheng?

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,230
The two of them, master and disciple,

71
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,070
are number one and two in terms of skills in the factory.

72
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,870
One

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,030
is honest and stubborn.

74
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,300
And the other

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,930
is glib.

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,160
Just look at

77
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,030
Liu Jun

78
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,230
and you can see that.

[Factory Floor Production: Zhang Sheng, Liu Jun]

80
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,410
What do you think

81
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,030
about letting them manage production

82
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,620
together?

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,040
That's fine.

84

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,940
Jiang Hu.

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,150
You're also

87
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,750
the sales director?

88
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,620
Can you handle it?

89
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,500
I have to.

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,990
I promised Xu Si

91
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,590
that the KPI

92
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,030
of the first quarter

93
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,050
will be 980,000.

94
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,470
If I can't achieve it,

95
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,350
he has the right to change

96
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,220
the professional manager.

97
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,030
Jiang Hu.

98
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,720
Have you finally come to your senses

99
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
and want to

100
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,390
toss this hot potato,

101
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,680
Teng Yue, to someone else?

102
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,150
Which word of mine

103
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,830
made you come to this conclusion?

104
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,610
You...

105
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,420
You've set

106
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,660
an unattainable goal.

107
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,710
And then

108
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,590
you'll give yourself a way out

109
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,260
and keep your dignity,

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,770
and shift the blame

111
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,820
to Xu Si.

112
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,710
Am I this useless

113
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,830
in your eyes?

114
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,990
I'm the one who sold 20,000 shoes

115
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,030
in a month,

116
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,610
okay?

117
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,800
Yes.

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,990
But...

119
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:53,790
You...

120
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,830
You have the face

121
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,510
of a spendthrift.

122
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,150
I...

123
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,510
This...

124
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,150
You're not like

125
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,260
someone who can endure hardships.

126
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,280
That's also hereditary.

127
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,220
You're also responsible for that.

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
In just a month's time,

129
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,830
she sold out

130
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,330
one year's worth of Teng Yue's backlogged inventory.

131
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,740
Over the past ten years, Teng Yue has never had

132
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,330
such a suitable sales talent.

133
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,720
A good founder

134
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,580
should first and foremost be a good salesman.

135
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,050
Just based on this?

136
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,660
Is she the one who you said you wanted to

137
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,590
invest in?

138
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,870
In the shoe-making industry,

139
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,010
a contract for a shoe factory of at least 1,000 square meters

140
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,380
has to be signed for a minimum of five years.

141
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,550
For the K32 land

142
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,700
that Teng Yue is on,

143
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,330
the vacancy period we're planning for

144
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,960
is two years.

145
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,070
The current rental situations of the other vacant factories

146
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,200
on the plot of land are not ideal.

147
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,530
As an investor, apart from investing in people,

148
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,090
you also have to be aware of

149
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,810
all the chips on the table.

150
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,110
Designer.

151
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,080
Teng Yue's previous design drawings

152
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,110
all belonged to Free Unicorn.

153
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,110
The designer

154
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,470
designs a few new designs every year

155
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,410
and sends them to me.

156
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,030
But now,

157
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,960
that's gone too.

158
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,940
All gone.

159
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,740
I think

160
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,150
Teng Yue has to have

161
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,500
our own product style.

162
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,710
We can't rely on Free Unicorn

163
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,850
like before.

164
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,870
I'll recruit

165
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,650
the designer myself.

166
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,850
E-commerce?

167
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
This used to be

168
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,350
handled by

169
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,700
Free Unicorn's E-commerce Department.

170
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,600
But now,

171
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,960
that's gone too.

172
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,350
Then we have to

173
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,830
find a proxy operations agency ourselves.

174
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,140
But it costs money to find

175
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,420
a proxy operations agency ourselves.

176
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,380
Let me ask you.

177
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
How much money do you have left

178
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,000
to be tossed around?

179
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,050
Well,

180
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,580
I should have a suitable candidate.

181
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,620
Oh, right.

182
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,170
Well,

183
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,270
for the account

184
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,790
of 20,000 pairs of shoes,

185
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,820
I've been checking it for two days

186
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,350
but I still can't figure it out.

187
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,030
Find an accountant quickly.

188
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,350
This is our top priority.

189
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,020
CFO.

190
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,470
In a few days,

191
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,610
it'll be 100 days since Dad passed.

192
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,270
Yes.

193
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,010
These three months

194
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,890
felt like three years.

195
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,620
Yue Shan

196
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,160
will likely visit Dad's grave.

197
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,480
Jiang Hu.

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,730
Jiang Hu?

199
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,080
Don't tell me you're trying to hire her?

200
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,940
I think she's suitable.

201
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,710
I don't think it's possible.

202
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,870
Why?

203
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,260
Think about it.

204
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,300
When she used to work for your dad,

205
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,900
how much was her annual salary?

206
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,200
Not to mention 20% off,

207
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,370
you can't afford it

208
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,400
even at the lowest possible price.

209
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,320
You'd better look around conscientiously

210
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,940
in the labor market

211
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,210
and find

212
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,640
an accountant who just graduated.

213
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,510
The monthly salary will be around 5,000 yuan.

214
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,100
What if she volunteered

215
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,990
to help?

216
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,080
Say it again.

217
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,850
I said,

218
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,440
what if she volunteered to help?

219
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,410
In broad daylight,

220
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,870
stop daydreaming.

221
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,990
You'd better think about

222
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,370
the order

223
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,670
of the 20,000 shoes.

224
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,270
Fine.

225
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,830
Later, I'll go look around

226
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,350
the distribution channels Ms. Song introduced.

227
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,060
You know what?

228
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,400
Our shoes are selling well

229
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,670
in these supermarkets,

230
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,980
grocery stores and whatnot.

231
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,770
Then hurry up and go.

232
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,060
I'm not coming back for lunch.

233
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,130
You can reimburse it yourself.

234
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,010
Mr. Pei, you sure are generous.

235
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,970
Mom.

236
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,000
Come here.

237
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,550
Jian.

238
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,630
I won't come back

239
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,810
for lunch today.

240
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,850
I'm going on a date.

241
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,210
Don't make my lunch.

242
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
Zhaoyang

243
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,260
doesn't even greet me

244
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
when she leaves and comes home.

245
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,310
She's so cold to me.

246
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,430
So,

247
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,590
I have to go on a date.

248
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,360
Mom.

249
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,920
Don't leave in a hurry.

250
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,760
Take a look at this.

251
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm going on a date.

252
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,500
What do you want?

253
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Don't waste my time.

254
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,230
What is it?

255
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
This is in English.

256
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,440
How can I understand it?

257
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,830
Come on.

258
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:49,940
Mom.

259
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,990
This

260
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,450
is Zhaoyang's immigration application.

261
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,090
Immigration?

262
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,100
Where did she get the money to immigrate?

263
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,720
When did she apply to immigrate?

264
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,630
She applied for

265
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,030
a skilled immigration in Canada.

266
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,710
She applied for a school there.

267
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,010
Also, her current boss

268
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,890
vouched for her.

269
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,060
I disagree.

270
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,310
What would become of me if she leaves?

271
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,240
Zhaoyang is an adult now.

272
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,760
From the legal point of view,

273
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,520
you have no right to disagree.

274
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,130
What do you mean?

275
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,660
She wants to abandon her mom?

276
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,000
How can she do that? I...

277
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,340
I need to talk to her.

278
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,420
For what?

279
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,590
Are you going to

280
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,440
add fuel to the fire now?

281
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,690
Don't you know her personality?

282
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
What if she flies away tomorrow

283
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,250
after you fight with her?

284
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,500
Who is it?

285
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,870
So annoying.

286
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,630
Hello.

287
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,220
Is Ms. Zhou Suqing here?

288
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,130
Yes. It's me.

289
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,630
I'm

290
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,990
a lawyer from Xiangbei Law Firm,

291
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,570
Chen Chang.

292
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,540
A lawyer?

293
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,400
[Vice President's Office]

294
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,990
This is the Silver Award trophy of St. Laurent Competition.

295
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,010
Although it's a gift for the company,

296
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,610
it's all thanks to your efforts.

297
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,940
You can bring home

298
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,290
this trophy.

299
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,450
Congratulations.

300
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,450
Thank you.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,790
I've watched your videos online.

302
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,750
Zhaoyang.

303
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,170
You're talented.

304
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,920
Be it as a painter

305
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,260
or a designer,

306
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,790
I hope

307
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,000
we can have a chance

308
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,110
to cooperate again

309
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,260
in other ways.

310
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,730
Maybe the other ways of cooperation you're talking about

311
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,500
are different from what I'm looking for.

312
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,460
Ms. Wang Hua

313
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,070
entrusted us

314
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,160
to deliver this lawyer's letter.

315
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,110
She hopes Ms. Zhou

316
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,950
can pay off the debt

317
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,510
in a week.

318
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
Who's Wang Hua?

319
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,030
Lili's mom.

320
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,900
Lawyer Chen.

321
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,830
Ms. Wang Hua and I

322
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,860
are neighbors.

323
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,430
Neighbors are like family.

324
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,990
It's a family conflict.

325
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,500
Besides, it's not like I won't pay back the money.

326
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
Why did she hire a lawyer?

327
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,740
It's become so official.

328
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,480
If you can't

329
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,360
pay off the debt in a week,

330
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,890
we will represent Ms. Wang Hua

331
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,630
and file a civil lawsuit

332
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,860
with the small claims court.

333
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,350
A lawsuit?

334
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,420
Lawyer Chen.

335
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,770
What will happen

336
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,000
if there's a lawsuit?

337
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,760
I've handled many

338
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,680
civil loan dispute cases.

339
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,690
There are not many cases like yours where the evidence

340
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,400
is conclusive.

341
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,840
Delaying payment until after the lawsuit

342
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,760
is no different

343
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,960
from paying it now.

344
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,820
It's just that the plaintiff

345
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,080
will have to wait for a while.

346
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,490
And you, the defendant,

347
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,430
will have to bear an addition litigation cost.

348
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,910
So I hope

349
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,190
both parties can settle out of court.

350
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,410
Mom.

351
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,340
You can't go to court.

352
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,850
Think about it.

353
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,980
If Zhaoyang knows

354
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,010
about your lawsuit,

355
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,430
she'll hasten

356
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,560
her immigration process.

357
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,310
By then,

358
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,870
you'll really be alone.

359
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,690
Then what should we do?

360
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,470
Yang Jian.

361
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,280
Ms. Wang.

362
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Did you bring the money?

363
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,480
I have your card number.

364
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,910
I'll transfer it to you later.

365
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,480
You brought your IOU, right?

366
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,830
Later,

367
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,760
if you tear it up on the spot,

368
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,950
who can I ask for the money from?

369
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,120
You should let me

370
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,470
check the handwriting.

371
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,310
Fine.

372
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,630
This

373
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,500
is Lawyer Chen.

374
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,630
He will be our witness today.

375
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,050
I won't give you a penny less.

376
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,050
Hello, this is my name card.

377
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,560
So you're a real lawyer.

378
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,670
Ms. Wang, how about this?

379
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,800
I'll transfer the money to you first.

380
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,650
Okay.

381
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,750
Let me take a video

382
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,720
as evidence for you.

383
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,640
In the future,

384
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,910
take care of your mother.

385
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,830
Get her to stop borrowing money from her neighbors.

386
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,890
It's inappropriate.

387
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,510
As for you,

388
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,320
I advise you

389
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,240
to also hold back on

390
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,880
your restless desire to become rich.

391
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,040
Don't be swayed by rumors

392
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,510
and stay away from investment routes with good interest rates

393
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,430
in the future.

394
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,760
Someone didn't pay me back the debt they owed me.

395
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,320
Why should I blame myself?

396
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,420
It's just a friendly reminder.

397
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,750
Okay, I've transferred it. Look.

398
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,380
Okay, got it.

399
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,960
By the way,

400
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,230
when you see my mom next time,

401
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,710
just like I told you before,

402
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,840
Lawyer Chen

403
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,030
is your agent.

404
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,200
Okay.

405
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,580
Got it.

406
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,460
I'm leaving.

407
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,350
Ms. Wang.

408
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,110
This way.

409
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,470
Bye.

410
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,260
Bye.

411
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,670
Lawyer Chen.

412
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,280
Thank you.

413
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,290
Thank you for your hard work today.

414
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,410
These two old ladies

415
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,980
have really been giving me a hard time.

416
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,589
You're Lawyer Mo's friend.

417
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,859
This is nothing.

418
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,710
I think these two old ladies

419
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,550
have

420
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,990
resolved their issue successfully.

421
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,440
I hope so.

422
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,990
I'll get going then.

423
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,980
Keep in touch.

424
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,450
Okay.

425
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,470
Thank you very much.

426
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,220
Let's have dinner at the restaurant later.

427
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,310
No problem.

428
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,710
I'll get going.

429
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,370
What about the 100,000 yuan?

430
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,220
Mom.

431
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,980
Have a seat.

432
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,590
I've paid off

433
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,710
that debt for you.

434
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,310
But you can't tell Zhaoyang

435
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,080
about this.

436
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,110
I don't need the money urgently.

437
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,970
Because

438
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,310
everyone in the neighborhood knows

439
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,710
about Lili's mom getting a lawyer.

440
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,960
If Zhaoyang really immigrated to Europe...

441
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,230
No, Canada,

442
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
there'll be no one to take care of you.

443
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,570
Jian.

444
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040
Now that Zhaoyang doesn't care about me,

445
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,180
you don't care about me too?

446
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,300
Tell me.

447
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,620
Will Zhaoyang

448
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,190
really leave?

449
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,710
If she really leaves,

450
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,510
I'll actually be very sad.

451
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,780
Mom.

452
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,150
Others don't know how Zhaoyang has spent

453
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,250
the past few years,

454
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,390
but you should know.

455
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,660
Everyone has a bottom line.

456
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,170
If the bottom line is crossed,

457
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,510
you'll really have no one to rely on.

458
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,720
I'll be frank and say one more unpleasant thing.

459
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,700
As for me,

460
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,240
I'm doing you a favor by helping you.

461
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,900
It's not my duty

462
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,120
to help you.

463
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,850

464
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,810
Why...

465
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,680
Why are you

466
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,110
talking to me like this?

467
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,400
How could you be like this?

468
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,090
Are you two really abandoning me?

469
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,740
I'm actually just a weak woman.

470

What is it?

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
What are you doing?

480
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,980
This is the proxy operations fees

481
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,890
for helping Teng Yue sell shoes

482
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,710

485
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,530
It's more ceremonious to pay like this.

486
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,620
Within three days,

487
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,200
please issue a VAT invoice to Teng Yue.

488
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,630

489
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,700
What? Is it too little?

490
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,940
I made comprehensive calculations

491
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,560
of the cost

You provide us

494
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,330
with a third of the store managers

495
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,340
and one customer service representative,

496
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,620
according to ten work hours a day.

497
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,210

500
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,140

529
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,360
I didn't expect everything to be removed from the shelves

530
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,150
in one night.

531
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,620
Now, no one's willing

532
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,710

didn't let us open an online store.

537
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,960
In the end,

538
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,360
our style is too old-fashioned.

539
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,680
And it looks like

540
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,690
it doesn't contain any skills.

544
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,940
and printed it on the shoe.

545
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,120
It stood out instantly.

546
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,310
That's right.

547
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,660
Back then, this logo was considered

548
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,060
really beautiful.

549
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,860
Beautiful.

550
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,670

I dare say

560
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,460
Teng Yue's shoes

561
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,600
are the most suitable

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,430
I visited Dr. Qi.

566
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,190
He said

567
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:20,910
that he'll continue

568
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,900

571

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,470
is quite good at cutting costs.

579
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,070
There isn't even a door guard.

580
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,670
I can understand if it's really

581
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,750
for cutting costs.

582
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,480
I'm afraid it's because she isn't managing the business well.

583
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,500
Wait for me here.

584
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,210
Okay.

585
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,410
Three tens.

586
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,430
Hurry up.

587
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,000
Three tens.

588
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,680
Three Js.

589
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,310
Four eights.

590
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,430
Is this a bomb?

591
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,870
Where did it explode?

592
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,470
Cheating?

593
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,170
Explode.

594
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,150
Three As.

595
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:53,960
Do you want it?

596
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,630
Three As are quite big.

597
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,750
Do you want it?

598
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,430
Pass.

599
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,260
[Friendly reminder: This is necessary for the shoot. Please don't imitate.]

600
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
A good dog doesn't block the way.

601
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,320
Move!

602
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,660
You won't move?

603
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,140
Fine.

604
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,840
I... I won't stoop to your level.

605
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,640
Jiang Hu.

606
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,220
This...

607
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,910
Come here, Boss.

608
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,340
I... I c-can't go over.

609
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,110
Boss.

610
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,500
Boss.

611
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,730
Mr. Xu.

612
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,710
You're here.

613
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,590
Uncle.

614
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,590
Take Boss aside.

615
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,070
This...

616
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,930
Come on. Let's go.

617
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,770
The big boss is here.

618
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,010
Little boss, it's time for your exit.

619
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,500
Come on, let's go.

620
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,490
Boss.

621
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,500
Can you come in now?

622
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,470
Come in.

623
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,150
Boss seems to like you.

624
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,590
It's an honor.

625
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,730
At least you don't have to be afraid.

626
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,360
You are so strong.

627
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,580
Why are you afraid of a little puppy?

628
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,750
A little puppy?

629
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,410
It's so big.

630
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,820
Why don't you put it on a leash?

631
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,670
Do you think that's appropriate?

632
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,460
Who wouldn't be afraid seeing it?

633
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,630
Ridiculous.

634
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,750
So you're here

635
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,900
to find fault with me.

636
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,390
It turns out that

637
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,830
more than half of Teng Yue's important positions

638
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,760
are still undecided.

639
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,470
I thought

640
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,070
that after selling 20,000 pairs of shoes,

641
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,220
Teng Yue would surprise me more.

642
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,320
I didn't expect

643
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,850
the surprise to end there.

644
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,030
A surprise

645
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,510
takes time to prepare,

646
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,150
okay?

647
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,090
It's only been a week.

648
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,010
A week

649
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,230
is already a very long time.

650
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,670
You don't have a R&D team.

651
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,780
The production line is empty.

652
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,010
This is a production problem.

653
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,330
It's working hours,

654
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,170
but the workers are still playing cards.

655
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,580
No one is guarding at the door.

656
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,990
-It’s a management...
-Who said no one's guarding?

657
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,370
Didn't you almost fail to come in?

658
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,820
Anyway, you're a lazy bunch.

659
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,230
This is a management problem.

660
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,420
As for sales,

661
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:04,910
the problem

662
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,100
is even more blatant.

663
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,840
I'm solving them one by one.

664
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,710
Solving them one by one?

665
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,320
Then your pace

666
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,530
is too slow.

667
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,600
The execution efficiency is so low.

668
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,140
How can I be confident in you?

669
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,580
Doing business is different from investment.

670
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,450
It's a process that takes time.

671
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,290
You have to give

672
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,200
us working folk

673
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,760
a little chance to breathe.

674
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,870
If I didn't give you a chance,

675
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,370
you wouldn't be sitting here today.

676
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,010
I didn't invite you here anyway.

677
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,110
What do you think?

678
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,600
Let's go.

679
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,730
What's wrong?

680
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,590
Are you in a bad mood?

681
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,120
What's wrong?

682
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,250
Make an appointment

683
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,190
with several reliable operations teams

684
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,070
to have extensive chats with.

685
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,900
What operations team?

686
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,360
Shoe brand operations teams.

687
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,600
What do you mean?

688
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,410
Are you going to fire Ms. Jiang?

689
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,930
My goal has always been

690
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,810
to revive Teng Yue,

691
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
instead of destroying it.

692
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,610
Boss, wait.

693
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,980
Just wait a little longer.

694
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,000
At least wait for Jiang Hu's

695
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,910
sales results

696
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,680
of this quarter before deciding.

697
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,720
I want the fastest

698
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,790
and the best result.

699
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,760
I understand.

700
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,170
Boss.

701
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,390
I thought

702
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,180
you were emotionally invested

703
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,130
in this matter with Teng Yue.

704
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
Now it seems like

705
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,970
it's a regular rational investment.

706
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,520
If an investor

707
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,410
becomes emotionally invested

708
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,130
in a project,

709
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:10,950
then he is

710
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,070
an unqualified investor.

711
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,150
You're right.

712
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,790
I'll handle it now.

713
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,270
Mr. Xu.

714
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,740
Zhaoyang.

715
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,560
Congratulations.

716
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
I heard that the engagement data

717
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,810
of your recent videos are good.

718
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
You've garnered support

719
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,230
from much of Lidu's brands' resources.

720
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,410
Mr. Xu.

721
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,570
Do you judge a person's value

722
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,430
based solely on profit?

723
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,360
We need a standard to judge the value.

724
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,450
Nothing is fairer than data.

725
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
This standard

726
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,310
is so cruel.

727
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,780
-Mom.
-My dear, you're back.

728
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,930
You've worked hard. Take a rest.

729
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,590
I have no money.

730
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,320
What?

731
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,950
I specially came out

732
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,340
to take you home.

733
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,210
And

734
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,080
I bought you

735
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,490
your favorite strawberries.

736
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,260
Yang Jian bought these strawberries, right?

737
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,150
No, I bought them.

738
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,030
I went to the market

739
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,380
and picked them one by one.

740
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,720
Big and sweet ones.

741
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,800
I won't repay your debt for you anymore.

742
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,460
All right.

743
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,030
I've settled the debt.

744
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,030
I swear

745
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,340
I will never invest in stocks again.

746
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,630
I'm serious.

747
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,360
If you don't believe me,

748
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,910
I can write you a guarantee letter.

749
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,940
What do you want?

750
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,860
I just hope

751
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,480
you won't immigrate, okay?

752
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,160
Are you done with your meal?

753
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,430
What did you tell Mom?

754
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,410
What did she tell you?

755
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,330
She was...

756
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,280
acting very strangely.

757
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,470
She begged me not to leave.

758
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,400
She said she paid the debt herself.

759
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,490
She even told me seriously

760
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,350
that she won't invest in stocks anymore.

761
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,320
She even wrote me a guarantee letter.

762
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,920
A guarantee letter?

763
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,250
Looks like it worked this time.

764
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,030
Wait.

765
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,230
What nonsense

766
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,390
did you tell her?

767
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:51,990
Also,

768
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,270
why did she mention immigration?

769
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,250
You're busy at work.

770
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,250
Time is precious.

771
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,690
Don't worry about this.

772
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,120
Okay, I'm leaving.

773
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,540
By the way,

774
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,370
in the future, if Mom

775
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,870
mentions something absurd again,

776
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,820
just look for me.

777
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,610
I'll deal with her.

778
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,280
Take care on the way home.

779
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,100
He used my paper again.

780
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,580
Hello, Mo Bei.

781
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,060
Yes.

782
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,700
I still want to ask you

783
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,930
about the problem with the non-compete agreement.

784
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,600
It can be solved, right?

785
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,640
We need to write

786
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,550
the termination agreement, right?

787
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:55,610
What?

788
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,630
We also need to make compensation?

789
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,150
Why?

790
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,739
Fine.

791
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,750
Got it.

792
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,500
Okay, I'll contact you again if I have any questions.

793
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,790
Thanks.

794
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,010
Okay.

795
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,659
Yang Jian.

796
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,030
Why did you come down?

797
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,370
I just

798
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,040
have something I forgot to ask you.

799
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,719
You could have just called me

800
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,510
and I'd go upstairs.

801
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,630
Why did you come down by yourself?

802
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,620
Tell me. What is it?

803
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,550
I heard from Qi that Jiang Hu looked for you.

804
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,670
She wants you

805
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,830
to run Tengyuan's online store.

806
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,290
Qi's asking for a beating again.

807
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,580
It's true?

808
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,489
I didn't agree.

809
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,810
Is it because of my grudge with her?

810
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,570
We are family.

811
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,400
I can't possibly

812
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,510
side with an outsider.

813
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,510
That's our grudge.

814
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,600
That's my business.

815
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,680
It has nothing to do with your cooperation with her.

816
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,610
Besides, this is your career.

817
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,190
You don't need to consider my opinion.

818
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,030
Of course

819
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,980
I've to consider your opinion.

820
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,130
I care about you.

821
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,310
Don't you always say that

822
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,240
Mom doesn't care about your feelings?

823
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,350
So, I especially care about your feelings.

824
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,800
I mean,

825
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,970
I happen to hear Xu Si mention

826
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,240
that he wants to take away

827
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,930
Jiang Hu's right to manage Teng Yue.

828
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,310
I think

829
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,980
she's in a difficult situation now.

830
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,200
If

831
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,610
you can help her,

832
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,030
maybe

833
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,160
it can be

834
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,460
quite good.

835
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,920
Wait a minute.

836
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,990
Did I hear it right?

837
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,400
You want to help Jiang Hu?

838
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,110
Jiang Hu

839
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,060
is quite arrogant and domineering indeed.

840
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,760
Sometimes, she's really annoying.

841
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,190
But

842
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,110
right now,

843
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,590
she fell from

844
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,320
such a high position

845
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,800
and has no one to rely on.

846
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,480
Besides,

847
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,630
she's such a proud person.

848
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,750
Now she even has to learn to beg

849
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,820
and please others.

850
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,450
It mustn't feel too good.

851
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,440
Are you able to forget

852
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,860
how she made you lose your job?

853
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,370
I'm not forgetting,

854
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,090
but letting go of the past misery.

855
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,490
I'm healing from it.

856
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,550
All right.

857
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,110
It's freezing.

858
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,070
Let's buy some drinks.

859
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:29,710
Let's go.

860
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,990
Aunt, what's wrong?

861
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,680
Your mother fell down at the factory.

862
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,920
Come here quickly.

863
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,970
She's not acting this time.

864
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,920
Tell her not to move.

865
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,830
Be careful of secondary injury.

866
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,630
Call an ambulance.

867
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,590
I'll be right there.

868
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,350
Come on.

869
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:11,920
Be careful.

870
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,470
Be careful.

871
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,110
Slowly.

872
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,770
I can do it.

873
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,720
I'm fine.

874
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,610
Your back is injured to this extent,

875
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,920
yet you still refuse to be hospitalized.

876
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,660
Sit down first.

877
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,330
Come on.

878
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,670
Slowly.

879
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,230
Slowly.

880
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,530
It's okay, I'm fine.

881
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,680
Look at your bad temper.

882
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
Your son is

883
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,370
just like you.

884
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,870
No.

885
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,970
You're more annoying than him.

886
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,220
It's just

887
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,560
a lumbar disc herniation.

888
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,080
It's an old ailment.

889
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,170
The doctor said

890
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,700
that you have to receive surgery to treat it.

891
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,890
And as soon as possible.

892
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
Don't listen to the doctor's threat.

893
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,150
Have you heard of anyone dying because of a backache?

894
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,150
Hey!

895
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,350
Don't talk about stuff like that.

896
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:51,900
Hurry.

897
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,530
Touch the wood.

898
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,110
Bah!

899
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,640
I've confirmed with the doctor.

900
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,000
This week,

901
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,690
I've arranged for an examination

902
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,550
and a surgery.

903
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,410
Yes, this time,

904
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,000
you have to listen to the kid.

905
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,050
I'll do the calculations for you two.

906
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:05,830
Look.

907
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,860
From the examination to the surgery

908
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,980
and until recovery,

909
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,080
it'll take at least half a month.

910
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,940
What about the goods in my warehouse?

911
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,550
If I don't sell the goods,

912
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,000
how can I get the salary of the workers?

913
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,370
Right?

914
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,150
Don't listen to this brat.

915
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,390
He's unscrupulous

916
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,030
and trying to shut down the factory.

917
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,280
It's that factory again.

918
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,020
All right.

919
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,030
Let's not talk about this.

920
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,510
No old lady

921
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,690
acts like you.

922
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,400
You never rest at all

923
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,810
and work at the factory every day.

924
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,590
You're not young anymore.

925
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,370
It's precisely because I'm not young anymore.

926
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,050
I don't have much time left.

927
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,700
That's why I should

928
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,070
make good use of my time.

929
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,740
Right?

930
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,720
Aunt.

931
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,270
I'll leave the factory to you for this week.

932
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,210
Sure, don't worry.

933
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll go back first.

934
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,390
Be careful, it's hot.

935
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,340
Don't move around.

936
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,660
I'm going to the office.

937
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,810
Have a good rest.

938
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,850
Why didn't you come to see me?

939
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,150
You must be mad at me.

940
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,970
I've been too busy lately.

941
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,790
The weather is getting better.

942
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,410
Don't always stay in your room.

943
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,160
If I'm busy

944
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,210
and can't come,

945
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,640
you can ask other nurses

946
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,740
to take you out for a walk.

947
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,130
I'll listen to you.

948
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,900
No matter what they say,

949
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,610
I'll follow you.

950
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,180
Let's jump the queue together.

951
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,350
We have a true bond.

952
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,300
Now,

953
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,720
I think the warehouse's situation

954
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,860
is getting better.

955
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,680
But you

956
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,660
are having a hard time.

957
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,180
I will help you.

958
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,890
I will help you.

959
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,200
[Tomb of Kind Father Jiang Qisheng and Kind Mother Pei Zhijian]

960
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,820
Dad.

961
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,320
It's only after all these things,

962
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,930
that I truly realized

963
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,020
that this industry

964
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,270
is a fable

965
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,720
and not a fairy tale.

966
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,460
I really don't know

967
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,980
how much longer I can hold on

968
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,580
and how far I can go.

969
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,100
A start-up is a risky process.

970
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,930
How can you succeed

971
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,920
without taking risks?

972
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,290
Ms. Yue.

973
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,140
Why are you here?

974
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,090
Today marks the 100th day since your dad's passing.

975
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,720
Dad has left me

976
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,640
for 100 days.

977
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,180
I feel like

978
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,720
it's been as long as a century.

979
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,930
Do you want to hear about your father?

980
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,940
In

981
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
Jiang's warehouse,

982
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,730
there is some accumulated stock.

983
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,990
But

984
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,350
we can't sell them in private.

985
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,870
Even if that individual business owner

986
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,530
is your best friend,

987
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,840
you still mustn't engage in

988
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,020
illicit trading.

989
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,020
After that individual business owner was arrested,

990
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,160
the police followed the clues

991
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,380
and found Gao Zheng.

992
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,900
Your dad never expected

993
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,670
that his most trusted friend

994
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,860
would be involved in embezzlement.
