172
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,460
I don't know how long he'll be fooled for.

I plan to

174
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,860
fool him for half a year.

you can't even fool him for ten minutes.

and said it's

194
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,160
a MRI scan.

195
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,060
I was looking at it for a long time.

196
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,810
Do you think I'm stupid

197
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,360
or are you stupid?

198
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,320
Then why did you go along with the act?

199
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,190
Why didn't you discuss it

200
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,950
with your mom?

201
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,180
I screwed it up.

202
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,010
She's not open to discussion.

203
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,910
I'll only get scolded.

204
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,670
I'll go home for dinner this weekend.

205
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,190
Sure.

206
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,860
When the time comes,

207
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,670
discuss it with your mom.

208
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,670
Look.

209
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,570
You should've been more careful.

210
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,400
He saw through it.

211
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,060
The prop wasn't prepared properly, right?

212
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,710
Moping, it really wasn't your acting.

213
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,740
I think you did a great job with the acting.

214
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,490
But this prop exposed you.

215
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,220
All right.

216
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,240
Put it away.

217
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,200
The plane.

218
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,590
It exploded.

219
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,570
Do you have a bigger card?

220
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,380
No.

221
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,350
No?

222
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,670
Then I'll run with it.

223
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,900
Shuffle the cards.

224
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,660
We're still affiliated to the factory.

225
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,060
They have to pay us our wages.

226
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
Can we stop playing cards

227
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,060
and talk about business?

228
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,320
The nearby factories

229
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,870
have either been shut down or relocated.

230
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,320
How about we

231
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,210
think of a solution?

232
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,430
Don't just wait here.

233
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,190
If there's no work to do,

234
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,310
we won't get paid.

235
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,230
Yes, you're right.

236
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,230
I need to take this call.

237
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,990
Come on.

238
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,590
Come on, Xiaolin.

239
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,430
Come on, play my cards for me.

240
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,440
Why should I play?

241
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,350
You play. I'm not playing.

242
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,430
How can I still be in the mood to play cards?

243
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,770
Hurry and come up with some solutions.

244
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,130
The price is too high?

245
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,830
Think carefully.

246
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,850
The workers I have are all

247
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,920
veteran craftsmen who've been making shoes

248
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,780
for many years.

249
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,230
One of them

250
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,990
is equivalent to a truckload of novices.

251
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,310
Where can you find such workers now?

252
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,500
Also, let me tell you.

253
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,600
Seize the chance while it's still available.

254
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,990
If you won't take it,

255
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,620
I'll ask other employment agencies

256
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,920
to take this order immediately.

257
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,290
500 yuan per person.

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,160
You're so despicable.

259
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,390
400.

260
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,580
It's a deal.

261
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,120
Why are you here?

262
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,380
I'm hanging up.

263
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,710
Master.

264
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,750
Since you saw me,

265
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,960
I'll be honest with you.

266
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,670
In this factory,

267
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,300
we haven't had any work to do for days.

268
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,510
Isn't it a problem?

269
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,650
I have to find a way out

270
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,510
for my comrades.

271
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,240
Ms. Jiang

272
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,520
will figure this out.

273
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,030
Don’t try to

274
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,670
come up with weird ideas in the future.

275
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,580
Okay?

276
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,360
Do you even believe

277
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,630
what you said?

278
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:51,990
Master.

279
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,550
Are we getting paid next month?

280
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,100
Have you asked Pei?

281
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,710
We can't just sit and do nothing.

282
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,780
You have to give her some time,

283
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,730
right?

284
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:00,970
Yes.

285
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,790
Give her time.

286
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,160
But who will give us time?

287
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,360
-No...
-Master.

288
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,230
Right now, you're being a little

289
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,590
stubborn.

290
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,280
I know you don't like

291
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,020
to hear this.

292
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,030
You're understanding because Ms. Jiang's grandfather

293
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,580
Mr. Pei is your master,

294
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,720
so you're willing to wait.

295
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,730
But the rest of us

296
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,430
have families to support.

297
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,660
We can't afford to wait.

298
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,210
Master.

299
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,520
I'll stop here.

300
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,840
I have to continue badgering

301
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,570
Pei Zhiyuan.

302
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,120
If he won't pay me my wages,

303
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,040
I'll cut ties with them and leave.

304
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,960
You have no conscience.

305
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,210
How can you do that?

306
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,540
Let me tell you.

307
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,420
I know.

308
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,840
I will give you what I should.

309
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,520
Why are you guys

310
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,430
so anxious?

311
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,590
Jiang Hu.

312
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,570
I've found some factories for you.

313
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,940
Take a look.

314
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,770
These prices

315
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,550
are already hurting my eyes.

316
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,430
You can't afford them.

317
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,300
There are a few more places

318
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,540
but they aren't willing to rent them.

319
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,490
This circle is too small.

320
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,119
Everyone knows you have no money

321
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,270
and you're in debt.

322
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,990
That's why

323
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,310
they aren't willing to get involved in this.

324
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,010
Just now...

325
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,150
Just now, Liu Jun

326
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,470
also called.

327
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,170
He asked me how I'm calculating

328
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,430
this month's wages.

329
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,060
If we stay open,

330
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,180
we have to spend money

331
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,410
in many aspects.

332
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,860
Look.

333
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,000
Back to zero.

334
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,360
Look.

335
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,810
This is what's left now.

336
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,130
Look.

337
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,710
Don't think too much.

338
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,220
Just find a way

339
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,000
to sell Teng Yue for profit

340
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,330
and get some money back.

341
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,280
Then you can go abroad

342
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,740
and live your life.

343
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,190
First, use the money you got back

344
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,710
and pay the workers.

345
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,100
How can I pay the workers?

346
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,670
Don't be ridiculous.

347
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,300
We don't even have enough money

348
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,520
for the factory's rent.

349
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,250
Uncle.

350
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,490
Dozens of workers in the factory

351
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,560
have been working here for a long time,

352
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,660
like Master Zhang.

353
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,210
He was already here when Grandpa

354
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
was the factory director.

355
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,870
Even those who haven't been working for long

356
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,300
have already been here for two to three years.

357
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,800
This time, Teng Yue is in trouble

358
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,260
and they're staying

359
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,040
only because they respect my dad.

360
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,510
My dad once told me

361
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,270
that you can delay everything

362
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,880
but you mustn't delay paying the workers their wages.

363
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,540
You're too naive.

364
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,580
Among those...

365
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,030
Among those who've stayed,

366
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,440
most

367
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,820
of them

368
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,350
can't find another job.

369
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,550
If they'd found another job,

370
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,220
they would have left long ago.

371
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,420
Besides,

372
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,390
since they haven't done any work for a month,

373
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,410
it's reasonable to not

374
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,090
pay them their wages.

375
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,630
But we

376
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,530
want to continue running our business.

377
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,420
We must follow the labor laws.

378
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,950
And we need to be honest.

379
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,780
We're running a factory,

380
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,130
not an almshouse.

381
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:20,710
So

382
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,020
don't be so particular about it.

383
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,570
-You hear me?
-Where are the accounts I asked you to check?

384
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,850
What do you want them for?

385
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,590
Give them to me.

386
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,190
Give them to me.

387
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,880
Take a look yourself.

388
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,760
This will hurt your eyes.

389
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,710
S-Stop calculating.

390
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,210
Zero.

391
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,000
Back to zero.

392
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,680
All go back to zero.

393
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,590
[Hamburger set, without ice]

394
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,050
She doesn't have the aura of an influencer.

395
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,190
Are you really going to recommend her

396
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,980
to TT Media?

397
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,170
Ms. Xiang, this is a fan edit

398
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,620
of you painting on the wall

399
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,760
of Changle Restaurant.

400
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,270
In the video,

401
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:55,990
you always

402
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,470
only show your graceful figure from the back

403
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,700
and never show your full face.

404
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
You have also only just crossed the mark of

405
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,310
200,000 followers on Weibo.

406
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,950
The new host signed by TT Media,

407
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,920
Nan, already has

408
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,950
5 million Weibo followers.

409
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,600
If an independent influencer

410
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,470
with a certain number of followers

411
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,830
is commercially-packaged properly,

412
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,850
the engagement data will grow exponentially.

413
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,290
You're right.

414
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,900
Xiang Zhaoyang.

415
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,190
You've never posted videos

416
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,270
showing your full face on social media,

417
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:30,670
right?

418
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,760
I think your image

419
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,700
can be marketed.

420
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,970
I use my painting skills to attract followers.

421
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,070
The videos I post

422
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,150
are focused on the places

423
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,430
where I can paint.

424
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,100
For example,

425
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,370
furniture, clothes, shoes, and hats

426
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,880
are the focus.

427
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,960
That's far from enough.

428
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
Thomas is right.

429
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,030
You need to post some photos and videos.

430
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,300
Most importantly,

431
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,630
you need to show your face.

432
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,560
Mr. Xu.

433
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,820
I'm here today

434
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,560
only to talk about the possibility

435
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,580
of our cooperation.

436
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,610
How impressive.

437
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,730
You are now the boss of Teng Yue.

438
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,240
There's someone cooking for you.

439
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:16,690
Boss.

440
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,620
Is it delicious?

441
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,560
You're even ignoring me.

442
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,240
It's lunchtime.

443
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,060
I don't even have any concept of time anymore.

444
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,930
That's not a Free Unicorn shoe last.

445
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,310
You have a keen eye.

446
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,760
This used to be

447
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,610
Teng Yue's bestseller.

448
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,260
It was also the first pair of shoes

449
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,350
that your grandpa taught me to make.

450
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,090
I wasn't even born then.

451
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,820
Yes.

452
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,930
People can't live over a hundred years.

453
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,310
Only this factory and these shoes

454
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,830
can last for

455
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,930
hundreds of years.

456
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,310
This is also

457
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,470
what your grandpa said to me then.

458
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,380
Times have changed.

459
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,670
Let's go eat.

460
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,790
Jiang Hu.

461
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,350
In the end,

462
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,150
you create your own path.

463
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,510
For Teng Yue's sake,

464
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,700
you don't have to consider our plights.

465
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,160
Just follow your path.

466
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,420
Master Zhang.

467
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,160
Having everyone move forward

468
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,230
together with Teng Yue

469
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,600
is my path.

470
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,220
Have some water.

471
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,600
Thank you.

472
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,430
You're welcome.

473
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,500
Xiang Zhaoyang, save your gratitude first.

474
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,890
After listening to

475
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,660
your long speech,

476
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,630
the more I listened to it, the more awkward it got.

477
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,090
Let me summarize your opinions.

478
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,310
Firstly,

479
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,740
you don't want to get plastic surgery.

480
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,310
No problem.

481
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,020
Okay.

482
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,070
You won't give up your artwork copyright

483
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,710
to TT Media.

484
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,460
TT Media manages people,

485
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,390
not products.

486
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
That's not a problem either.

487
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,800
Fine.

488
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,140
But Xiang Zhaoyang,

489
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,070
you're only willing to sign a two-year contract

490
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,190
and not a five-year contract.

491
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,030
Do you know how demanding

492
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,000
this request is?

493
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,430
The cost invested in an individual influencer

494
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,910
by an influencer marketing agency

495
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,400
can't be amortized

496
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,720
within five years.

497
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,460
Yes.

498
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,500
Two years is too short.

499
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,780
Two years later,

500
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,710
I want to return to being a designer.

501
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,840
I thought you came to me today

502
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,960
because you're quitting as a designer.

503
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,560
I signed a two-year

504
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,380
non-compete agreement with Aneda.

505
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,630
I always thought

506
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,940
a low-level designer in the conventional industry

507
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,710
like you

508
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,870
wouldn't care about

509
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,030
such non-compete agreements.

510
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,190
Xiang Zhaoyang, listen.

511
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,270
Go and find

512
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,480
a shoe company to work at immediately.

513
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,620
They wouldn't waste the effort

514
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,220
to sue you.

515
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,950
Really.

516
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,230
It turns out that Ms. Xiang

517
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,750
is a woman of her word

518
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,270
and adheres to her principles.

519
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,410
How about this?

520
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,150
Sign on for five years.

521
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,710
The jobs TT Media

522
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,580
arranges for you

523
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,630
won't affect you being a designer.

524
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,640
We can include that in the contract.

525
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,450
But

526
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,110
you have to complete

527
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,790
all training,

528
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,670
filming, and copywriting assignments

529
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,970
TT Media arranges for you.

530
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,420
Is that okay?

531
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,230
Yes.

532
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,010
Okay.

533
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,880
Then I'll send TT Media's address

534
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,400
to you.

535
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,130
We'll meet there

536
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,290
at 3 p.m.

537
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,950
I look forward to working with you.

538
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,870
Hello, everyone.

539
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,080
I’m Tao Xiaoying.

540
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,950
Today,

541
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,310
I'll recommend this

542
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,920
Ousley's moisturizing lotion.

543
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,960
Who is that?

544
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,470
She looks sort of familiar.

545
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,940
She's the newcomer signed by the company.

546
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,370
She looks rather ordinary.

547
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,610
She wants to be an influencer.

548
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,620
You hired an amateur

549
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,560
for a special plan.

550
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,250
I can understand that.

551
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,350
After all, finance

552
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,920
is our new content category.

553
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,090
But this Zhaoyang

554
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,440
is an online painter.

555
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,480
Wouldn't the investment cost

556
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,840
be too high for a special plan?

557
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,220
Last night's livestream

558
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,150
had 380,000 views,

559
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,790
but only resulted in 50,000 purchases.

560
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,620
The transaction amount is over 1 million.

561
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,850
You want him to replace Tao Xiaoying?

562
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,350
Do you think

563
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,090
this data is qualified?

564
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,150
The consumers of the face masks

565
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:17,810
we sold yesterday

566
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,970
were not Nan's followers.

567
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,070
Nan kept saying

568
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,660
that he uses the face mask often,

569
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,000
but he doesn't know

570
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,990
that it's washable.

571
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,720
And

572
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,230
he even said nonsense like how

573
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,070
a 299 yuan face mask

574
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,630
contains

575
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,520
a gram of gold.

576
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,400
Could he have said that

577
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,500
without preparation?

578
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,270
You watched last night's livestream?

579
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,420
The host's attitude was lax

580
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,970
and the product selection was a failure.

581
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,480
The company's influencers are positioned unclearly.

582
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,670
These are the problems

583
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,820
TT Media face now.

584
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,610
If we don't solve them as soon as possible

585
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,820
and develop new categories,

586
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,380
your Series B investor

587
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,470
Baoxing will

588
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,620
really reconsider.

589
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,310
Sit down.

590
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,110
Sit down.

591
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,870
I'm Nan.

592
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,210
This is Pang.

593
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,740
Hello.

594
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:18,780
Hello.

595
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,970
People from TT Media

596
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,020
are all very pure.

597
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,690
What I mean by pure

598
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,840
does not only

599
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,630
apply to interpersonal relationships,

600
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,430
but that we also work very hard.

601
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,480
Look at everyone.

602
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:28,870
Look.

603
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,630
Those impure people

604
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,770
are gone.

605
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,440
Pang is talking about Tao Xiaoying.

606
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,470
That person…

607
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,600
Forget it.

608
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,170
She has left the company.

609
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,010
Why talk about her?

610
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,650
But don't worry.

611
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,710
We

612
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,370
never step on newbies.

613
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,860
If you need any help,

614
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,990
just come to me.

615
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,270
I can do a collaborative livestream with you.

616
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,110
I guarantee you'll gain many followers.

617
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,870
Hello, Mr. Xu.

618
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,530
Ms. Song.

619
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,860
It seems that everyone has gotten acquainted.

620
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,670
We've even agreed on a collaborative livestream.

621
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,300
You don't have to do a collaborative livestream.

622
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,590
It's fine.

623
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,620
Newcomers

624
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,760
need some help after all.

625
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,870
Besides, none of us

626
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,860
think it's any trouble at all.

627
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,040
Dismissed.

628
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,160
Okay.

629
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,120
Let's go.

630
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,760
You are Zhaoyang?

631
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,430
Welcome to TT Media.

632
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,040
Check

633
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,170
these accounts.

634
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,100
Are...

635
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,490
you serious?

636
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,870
When I asked you

637
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,180
to help me demand payment for debts,

638
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,070
this is what I promised you.

639
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,650
After you pay this debt,

640
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,850
you'll have nothing left.

641
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,470
Qian and the others supplied the goods before signing the contract

642
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,040
because they trust Teng Yue.

643
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,340
If I betray this trust,

644
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,290
how am I different from those jerks

645
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,510
who owe my dad money

646
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,270
and refuse to pay?

647
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,880
Then what about this factory?

648
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,640
I have no choice.

649
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,960
The land belongs to someone else.

650
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,639
Teng Yue and I have nowhere to go.

651
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,929
It's the rule to pay your debt.

652
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,600
That's why I asked you to come.

653
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,750
I know it's tough for you right now.

654
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,409
How about this?

655
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,770
I'll tell Qian

656
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,940
that you'll pay back a portion first.

657
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,880
Leave some for yourself

658
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,010
to run the factory.

659
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,159
The remaining amount...

660
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:31,900
Don't worry.

661
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,670
I will pay it back.

662
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,679
I trust you.

663
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,020
Boss.

664
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,480
I've already sent a notice to everyone

665
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,719
about the good news

666
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,330
of Teng Yue coming to pay off its debts.

667
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,239
Yang Jian.

668
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:47,750
It is all here?

669
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,070
I knew you could be counted on

670
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,030
to settle this matter.

671
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,600
If I still can't

672
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,630
pay for my goods,

673
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,489
my factory

674
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,560
will go bankrupt at the end of the month.

675
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,110
Yes.

676
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:55,989
My workers

677
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,120
have also been waiting for this money

678
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,760
to get their wages.

679
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,720
Come on.

680
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,480
They are all here.

681
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,270
Wait, Qi.

682
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,830
You are so diligent.

683
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,230
Don't mention it.

684
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,870
It saves you the trouble.

685
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,460
Xie, how much is your portion?

686
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:15,950
80,000.

687
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,140
80,000.

688
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,720
Here.

689
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,780
Huang, what about you?

690
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,590
Mine is...

691
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,310
100,000.

692
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,340
Yes.

693
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,500
100,000? So much?

694
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,270
This is 60,000.

695
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,390
120,000.

696
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,010
100,000.

697
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,420
100,000.

698
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,790
Yours.

699
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,980
Thank you.

700
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,060
You're welcome.

701
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,800
Don't stand on ceremony.

702
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,770
Thank you, Yang Jian.

703
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,990
The road to happiness is full of hardships.

704
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,510
I'm sorry.

705
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,350
I was planning to

706
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,470
pay everyone back with this money anyway.

707
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,800
Now, this matter

708
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,830
can be concluded.

709
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,450
That's nice.

710
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,060
What are you going to do?

711
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,920
Even if I didn't pay you back,

712
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,310
this money

713
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,470
is just a drop in the bucket.

714
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,010
It can't solve the problem of the factory.

715
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,810
It's hard to run factories now.

716
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,750
I have a friend

717
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,950
who also ran a small factory.

718
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,970
It wasn't far from Teng Yue.

719
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,630
After the foreigners moved the OEM

720
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,590
to Southeast Asia,

721
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,830
his distribution channel was cut off.

722
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,200
So he sold the land

723
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,310
to Heyue Capital.

724
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,550
Heyue Capital?

725
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,400
The legal representative of Heyue Capital

726
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,920
is Du Botao?

727
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,670
You know him?

728
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,430
He's Xu Si's partner

729
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,540
and Du Weiye's son.

730
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,690
In other words, K32's 20,000 square meters

731
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,440
were all taken by Xu Si.

732
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,430
Using a company of a different title to handle the affairs

733
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,860
is a cover-up for the investors.

734
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,740
He's trying to

735
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,960
resell them at a profit.

736
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,190
My friend mentioned

737
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,340
that only after he signed the contract

738
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,040
did he find out

739
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,800
that Yuanfeng Logistics

740
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,110
took a liking to that land.

741
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,910
He regretted it so much.

742
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,380
He said he missed the chance to negotiate the price.

743
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,670
That's right.

744
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,900
Baoxing is doing land acquisition

745
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,880
for Yuanfeng Logistics.

746
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,230
It depends on whether he's

747
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,790
in a price tug-of-war with Yuanfeng Logistics

748
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,390
or waiting

749
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,630
for Yuanfeng's funds to be in place.

750
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,980
Such a big land

751
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,660
will have to be left unused for at least one or two years.

752
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,510
Because factories normally

753
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,310
won't accept such a short lease.

754
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,300
Unless it's a short-term rental warehouse.

755
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,090
But it's hard to fill the rental pool this way too.

756
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,380
Are you planning to be a holdout?

757
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,080
Do you think I can?

758
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,430
You've even asked around for debt payments with me.

759
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,480
What else can't you do?

760
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,690
Hello, Uncle.

761
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,890
I sent you a list.

762
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,780
Buy some furniture

763
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,590
and daily necessities for me.

764
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
I'll be living in the factory from now on.

765
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,150
What did you say?

766
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,820
You want to live in the factory?

767
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,970
You heard it right.

768
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,910
I've decided.

769
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,940
Teng Yue will stay put.

770
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,870
We're not moving.

771
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:40,380
[Teng Yue]

772
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,150
Okay.

773
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,000
Living in the factory?

774
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,370
Hello.

775
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,470
Mom.

776
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,470
You've recovered so soon?

777
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,870
Judging from what you said,

778
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,310
you don't want me to get well soon,

779
00:38:59,330 --> 00:38:59,850
right?

780
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,150
How dare I?

781
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:02,990
I'm relieved

782
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,750
to hear your

783
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,310
resounding voice.

784
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,680
Don't be so glib.

785
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,620
Tell me, what can I do for you?

786
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,990
Your aunt asked when you can

787
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,290
come home for a meal this weekend.

788
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,510
Hello?

789
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,910
Are you deep in thought again?

790
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,880
Why aren't you responding?

791
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,730
Tonight at 7 p.m.

792
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,920
I'm driving.

793
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,820
I have to hang up.

794
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,720
Hey, where are you going?

795
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,270
I almost forgot

796
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,030
that you're also a member here.

797
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,320
Everything here

798
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,120
doesn't suit you.

799
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,870
Go back

800
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,990
to a place that suits you.

801
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,380
Many things

802
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,280
don't depend on

803
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,150
their compatibility with me,

804
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,160
but my desire.

805
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,190
So?

806
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,990
I want to rent Teng Yue's land.
