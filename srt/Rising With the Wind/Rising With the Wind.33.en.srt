Mr. Xu, I heard

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,280
Teng Yue has found

7
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,270
a new buyer.

8
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,810
Right?

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,000
That's great.

10
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,000
Aneda is nice.

11
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,600
Really.

12
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,340

Teng Yue

15
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,789
can achieve better development.

16
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,990

You...

22
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,490
are not against it?

23
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:39,829
Do you want me to object to it

24
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,710
or not?

25
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,960

27
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,610
From the financial perspective,

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,150
I think it's a chance

29
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,110
for Teng Yue.

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,790

If we refuse the acquisition

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,510
and let Jiang Hu run the company independently,

35
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,240
it may take 5 years

36
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,860
or even longer

37
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,430
to reach such a scale.

38
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,390
It can also make Jiang Hu

39
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,500

40
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,520

surging.

115
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,720
If her value keeps surging,

116
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,350
we can

117
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,070
gain more benefits.

118
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,500

136
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:44,960
do you plan

137
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,630

138
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,130
I'll give this to him on his birthday.

140
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,430
Didn't you go to Teng Yue directly?

141
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,110
Why are you back?

142
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,990
Sit down. I want to ask you something.

143
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,590
Has Xu Si decided

144
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,630

145
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,470
How do you know about this?

146
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,240
That means it's true.

147
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,500
You even supported Xu Si.

148
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,110
Xu Si

149
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,180
just made

150
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,990
a better decision

151
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,190
for Teng Yue.

152
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,790
A better decision?

153
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,310
If it's a better decision,

154
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,580
why is he hiding it from Jiang Hu?

155
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,710
Why haven't you

156
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,980
told Jiang Hu?

157
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,510
Xu Si just wants

158
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,720
to find a better opportunity

159
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,310
to tell Jiang Hu personally.

160
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,590
What opportunity?

161
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,010
Selling Teng Yue

162
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,200
and making it something that cannot be undone?

163
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,830
Aneda's acquisition of Teng Yue

164
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,590
can help Teng Yue

165
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,620
expand its presence in the domestic market

166
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,540
and enter the overseas market.

167
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,390
And they...

168
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,800
they want to invite me

169
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,470
to be Aneda's designer again.

170
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,760
Now I understand.

171
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,530
Your plan

172
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,320
involves you,

173
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,110
Xu Si,

174
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,670
and everyone else,

175
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,900
except Jiang Hu, right?

176
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,980
Yang Jian,

177
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,640
you're being one-sided.

178
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,120
You are too selfish.

179
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,630
I understand why Xu Si wants to do this.

180
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,790
I'm not surprised at all.

181
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,500
But I don't understand you, Zhaoyang.

182
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,120
Even if you don't treat Jiang Hu as a friend,

183
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,590
at least she still treats you

184
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,060
as her closest partner.

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,590
Do you think

186
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,380
it's appropriate to do this?

187
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,170
This is not up to me

188
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,840
anyway.

189
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,260
Teng Yue

190
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,880
belongs to Xu Si and Jiang Hu.

191
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,220
No matter what they want to do,

192
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,460
it's their business.

193
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,360
I didn't expect you

194

203

Back then,

204

and Free Unicorn went bankrupt,

206
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,230

207
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,050
I fell into an abyss.

208
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,750
There was too much pressure.

209

But at the last moment,

212
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,810
I bought Teng Yue.

213
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,550
Instead of saying I saved Teng Yue,

214
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,010
I should say Teng Yue saved me.

215
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,290

221
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,150
was just to save the last bit of dignity

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,010
Come back. What are you going to do?

384
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,240
Come here.

385
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,150
What? I'm going to find Jiang Hu.

386
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,130
Can you be mature?

387
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,710
I don't want my friend

388
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,980
to be deceived like a fool.

389
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,580
Come back!

390
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,510
You know nothing about the situation.

391
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,230
You don't understand.

392
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,760
You are right. I don't understand.

393
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,000
Now,

394
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,060
I don't understand you anymore.

395
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,970
You have never understood me.

396
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,240
Let go.

397
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,310
But Dad once told me

398
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,850
that I can ask you for help

399
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,230
if there is a problem.

400
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,710
Just like asking for help from my family members.

401
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,750
Okay.

402
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,760
I'll help you.

403
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,330
The industry

404
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,590
is also optimistic

405
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,590
about Teng Yue's future development.

406
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,990
So...

407
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,070
Let's give a round of the warmest applause

408
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,910
and welcome Xiang Zhaoyang.

409
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,030
I'm Lord Zhaoyang.

410
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,230
I'm also Xiang Zhaoyang

411
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:41,990
who loves to design shoes.

412
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,590
From today onwards,

413
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,500
I will start my journey in Teng Yue.

414
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,960
In the near future,

415
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,120
I will share a brand-new Teng Yue with you.

416
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,550
Ms. Jiang.

417
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,380
Ms. Jiang.

418
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,740
Jiang Hu.

419
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,020
Jiang Hu.

420
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,740
Are you Jiang Hu?

421
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,990
Jiang Hu.

422
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,340
Ms. Jiang.

423
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,090
Ms. Jiang.

424
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,290
Jiang Hu.

425
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,510
What is meaningful to me

426
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,800
is only you.

427
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,570
Let's get married.

428
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,990
Today...

429
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,390
is Teng Yue's

430
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,360
100th anniversary.

431
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,230
Who would have thought

432
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,830
1 year ago,

433
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,660
Teng Yue almost went bankrupt?

434
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,330
If it weren't for the efforts

435
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,630
of Teng Yue's workers,

436
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,990
the situation

437
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,740
would probably be different today.

438
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,510
Now,

439
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,430
let's welcome Teng Yue's investor,

440
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,120
Mr. Xu Si,

441
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,040
to come to the stage.

442
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,710
Bravo.

443
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,990
For

444
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,600
Teng Yue's 100th anniversary celebration today,

445
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,630
I spent a month

446
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,240
preparing a thank-you speech in advance.

447
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,310
But I found

448
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,230
I can't describe

449
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,120
how I feel for Teng Yue's development

450
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,160
along the way.

451
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,950
I've imagined it countless times.

452
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,950
When I stand here today,

453
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,940
I might be sad,

454
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,680
excited,

455
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,790
anxious,

456
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,600
and satisfied.

457
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,120
But I have never thought

458
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,470
I would be confused,

459
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,230
shocked,

460
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,200
disgusted,

461
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,160
and resentful.

462
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,930
I really want to thank those

463
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,670
who made me

464
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,890
have these feelings.

465
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,530
Aunt Yue Shan,

466
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,560
who I trust the most.

467
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,530
Uncle Zhiyuan,

468
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,740
one of my few family members.

469
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,140
Xiang Zhaoyang,

470
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,040
my classmate

471
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,300
and like-minded partner.

472
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,510
The person I want to thank the most

473
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,180
is Mr. Xu.

474
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,390
He is not only

475
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,950
an excellent investor

476
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,470
and a responsible partner,

477
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,150
but also

478
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,110
an amazing actor.

479
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,250
How should I thank him?

480
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,260
Why did you hide it from me?

481
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,140
You've planned

482
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,740
to sell Teng Yue since the beginning, right?

483
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,390
Jiang Hu, you are drunk.

484
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,560
Let's walk off the stage and then talk.

485
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,920
About what?

486
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,890
About how tricky you are?

487
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,690
About how you lied to me?

488
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,820
You are a liar.

489
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,880
You lied to me from beginning to end.

490
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,110
You made me a fool.

491
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,770
You have set a trap

492
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,570
since the beginning.

493
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,150
You made me

494
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,020
gradually fall into the trap willingly.

495
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,140
I'm so silly.

496
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,720
You are an investor.

497
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,610
What you do is buying companies when they are cheap

498
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
and selling them when they are of value, right?

499
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,570
Jiang Hu,

500
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,610
considering your current state,

501
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,200
we can't talk properly.

502
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,120
Walk off the stage and then talk?

503
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,310
About what?

504
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,130
You want to talk in private?

505
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,910
After you have reached an agreement

506
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,610
with them?

507
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,950
I've always wanted to tell you.

508
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,280
Have you?

509
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,810
No.

510
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,600
Because I thought you would definitely object to it.

511
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,070
Will my objection make a difference?

512
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,830
You

513
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,120
did everything in an orderly manner

514
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,450
on your own.

515
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,110
You didn't ask for my opinion before you did it.

516
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,890
After you did it,

517
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,410
you didn't inform me immediately.

518
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,120
Because you've firmly believed

519
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,310
this is a good deal.

520
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,010
No one

521
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,740
can object to your decision.

522
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,400
Your only concern is

523
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,680
how to handle my reaction.

524
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,640
Before you

525
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,350
think of a perfect solution,

526
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,150
you can only hide it from me for as long as you can.

527
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,270
Am I right?

528
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,220
This is you.

529
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,420
You've been used

530
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,900
to controlling others' willpower.

531
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,010
You hope

532
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,720
everyone can do things

533
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,630
according to your plans.

534
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,120
No one can stop you.

535
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,670
If anyone gets in your way,

536
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,570
you will get rid of him

537
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,340
no matter what it takes.

538
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,880
So I'm this kind of person

539
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,610
in your heart.

540
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,960
Then what kind of person are you?

541
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,530
Do you think I want this?

542
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,110
Do you think

543
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,230
I should thank you

544
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,200
for being thoughtful?

545
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,930
Should I thank you for selling Teng Yue

546
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,560
so that we can get a lot of money

547
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,140
and everyone can gain benefits?

548
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,530
This is you,

549
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,250
Xu Si.

550
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,350
You ruined all my trust,

551
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,000
efforts,

552
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,110
and hope

553
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,050
without saying a word.

554
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,500
Teng Yue is my home.

555
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,690
This is my home.

556
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,040
Stop him!

557
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,490
Stop recording!

558
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,520
Move aside.

559
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,639
[Jiang Hu]

560
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,320
I think everyone here

561
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,330
should focus

562
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,690
on this structure.

563
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,830
What's wrong?

564
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:22,900
Hello?

565
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,030
What?

566
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,710
Okay. I know.

567
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,030
Jiang Hu.

568
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,750
Have you seen Jiang Hu?

569
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,920
Over there.

570
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,750
Hello?

571
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,480
Well.

572
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,210
Have you searched upstairs and downstairs?

573
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,210
Yes.

574
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,480
What is Mr. Pei doing?

575
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,200
He's entertaining guests upstairs.

576
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,410
Can he handle it on his own?

577
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,360
He can handle it.

578
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,140
No, no.

579
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,360
Master Zhang, listen to me.

580
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,320
Take the two old masters

581
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,170
to help Mr. Pei.

582
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,010
Well, you...

583
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,120
I can do it.

584
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,000
Be careful.

585
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,990
It's best that you ask

586
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,670
those reporters

587
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,470
to delete everything bad.

588
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,090
Stop them.

589
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,610
Okay, be careful.

590
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,360
Okay.

591
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,490
You guys, call her.

592
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,810
Will she pick up?

593
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,280
No.

594
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,300
Have you searched over there?

595
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,350
How did it go?

596
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,050
Have you found her?

597
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,270
I've searched the whole factory,

598
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:54,760
but couldn't find her.

599
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,790
I'm gonna drive to look for her outside.

600
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,660
Okay, I'm going with you.

601
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,270
Drive Mr. Pei's car and follow me.

602
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,200
Go, go, go.

603
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,790
Come with me.

604
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,750
Get in!

605
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,900
Go in that direction.

606
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,420
It's too old.

607
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,750
Is there really no other way?

608
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,000
If we force it,

609
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,690
it can live a few more days.

610
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,470
But it will be in great pain.

611
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,440
Now,

612
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,470
the best choice for it

613
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,050
is its owner

614
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,130
stays by its side.

615
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,710
I'm outside.

616
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,600
Call me

617
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,390
if anything happens.

618
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,780
Boss,

619
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,340
I have nothing left.

620
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,440
Are you gonna leave me too?
