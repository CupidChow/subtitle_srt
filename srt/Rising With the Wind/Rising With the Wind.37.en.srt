86
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,470
I barely wear them.

87
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,170
Try it on.

88
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,710

89
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,510

[The Age of Entrepreneurship]

197
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,500
It's one. You can go over.

198
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,900
Okay.

199
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,140
The representative of Cloud Footwear,

200
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,350
please come here and draw a number.

201
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,150
This way.

202
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,240
You got Tutor 3.

203
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,390
Please go to Room 3 later.

204
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,990
Go back to your seat

205
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,830
and get ready.

206
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,430
Thank you.

The representative of New Stock Group.

208
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,230
Tutor 2

209
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,660
is Sha Mo from Xinzhenghe.

210
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,750
She's

211
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,930
very strict

212
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,620
and asks tricky questions.

213
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,590
It's true.

214
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,150
How about Tutor 3?

215
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,550
Tutor 3

216
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,980
is Xu Si from Baoxing Investment.

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,160
Baoxing Investment?

218
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,590
He's the youngest

219
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,470
among all the tutors.

220
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,010
He likes investing

221
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,200
in new forms of consumption,

222
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,190
entertainment, social networking,

223
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,110
financial services, and technology.

224
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,630
You know,

225
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,320
industries like those.

226
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,150
So,

227
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,650
entrepreneurs

228
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,180
in manufacturing industries

229
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,900
will have no chance with him?

230
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,890
No.

231
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,200
Wrong industries.

232
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,750
Yeah.

233
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,370
What a pity.

234
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,160
Mr. Xu, you're Tutor 3.

235
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,190
You'll use Room 3.

236
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,590
Mr. Mei from Jingyang Capital

237
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,580
is Tutor 4.

238
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,620
He'll use Room 4.

239
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,610
By the way,

240
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,080
the tutors will interview the entrepreneurs today

241
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,990
to learn about their projects

242
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,930
and give them preliminary scores.

243
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,410
It's not anything official.

244
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,740
They're drawing straws to decide which tutor they'll meet.

245
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,600
Two tutors arrived early

246
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,300
and have started the interviews.

247
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,710
The odds are one to four.

248
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
What did you say?

249
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,470
Nothing.

250
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,590
Please.

251
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,520
Thank you.

252

[Tutor Room]

253
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,230
The representative of Chengyang Technology.

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,670
The representative of Cloud Footwear.

255
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,510
I'm here.

256
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,990
Okay. Follow me.

257
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,480
Mr. Xu.

258
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,830
You may start the interviews.

259
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:25,870
Okay.

260
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,530
Shall we start now?

261
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,660
Bring them over.

262
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,070
Okay.

263
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,230
Have a seat.

264
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,350
Please briefly introduce

265
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,230
your project.

266
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,510
Cloud Footwear is a cloth shoe company

267
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,310
with 100 years of history.

268
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,750
It has the best team

269
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,080
in the country for cloth shoe production.

270
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,930
Its hand-made, 1000-layer sole

271
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,510
is made through over 90 steps

272
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,470
and is famous all over the country.

273
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,470
Mr. Ye Guoming, the factory director,

274
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,870
and a team of textile experts

275
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,830
worked hard

276
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,990
for many years

277
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,950
and successfully

278
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,830
obtained seven patents.

279
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,730
Those two advantages are far from enough.

280
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,190
I have the experience

281
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,540
of successfully running

282
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,760
the time-honored canvas shoe company Teng Yue.

283
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,590
In just one year,

284
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,990
I increased Teng Yue's sales

285
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,240
to over 10 million yuan.

286
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,470
Sorry.

287
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,470
You didn't pass the interview.

288
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,590
It's okay.

289
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,090
Thank you

290
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,400
for interviewing me.

291
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,560
Miss Shoe Dog,

292
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,230
I'm looking forward

293
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,550
to your performance on this show.

294
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,850
Which tutor is she supposed to meet?

295
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,640
Tutor 3.

296
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,220
Tutor 3.

297
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,070
Sorry.

298
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,450
Tutor 3 is interviewing someone else.

299
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,050
Do you mind meeting Tutor 4?

300
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,700
No.

301
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,830
Come with me.

302
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,150
Ms. Jiang.

303
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,150
Prepare yourself.

304
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,010
See you later.

305
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,350
Sorry.

306
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,590
It's okay. Thank you.

307
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
You just missed her.

308
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,560
What?

309
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,630
Guess who I interviewed just now.

310
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,790
Who?

311
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,440
Miss Shoe Dog.

312
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,150
She loves making and selling shoes.

313
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,270
So she's a shoe dog.

314
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,740
Miss Shoe Dog is the best nickname

315
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,960
for Ms. Jiang, isn't it?

316
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,190
Stop looking.

317
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,910
She's gone.

318
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,230
Why are you so annoying?

319
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,520
Annoying?

320
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,430
I'm

321
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,069
very considerate, okay?

322
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,770
Don't worry.

323
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,609
I cut her some slack

324
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,630
and let her pass.

325
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,230
Just wait

326
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,069
to be reunited with her under the spotlight.

327
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,000
This time,

328
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,150
whether I can have braised pork knuckles

329
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,310
as the matchmaker

330
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,030
completely depends on you.

331
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,150
You're already a middle-aged man.

332
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,990
Eating too much meat is bad for your health.

333
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,750
Eat more vegetables.

334
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:42,940
Thank you.

335
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,600
You're welcome.

336
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,270
Uncle Xu.

337
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,910
My dad told me you went through a breakup.

338
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,680
Miss Jiang Hu dumped you.

339
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,160
I didn't know

340
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,430
your dad was so nosy.

341
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,450
You were dumped.

342
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,470
Would you like a beer?

343
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,910
That's what they would do on TV shows.

344
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,300
My mom just bought some beers

345
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,680
and cooled them in the fridge.

346
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,390
They can calm you down.

347
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,470
I'm very calm now.

348
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,720
I don't need a beer.

349
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,880
I think you're anything but calm.

350
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,700
I understand.

351
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,190
You adults

352
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,470
are under great pressure.

353
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,390
Thank you.

354
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,230
You're so sweet.

355
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,660
Since you're so sad,

356
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,530
I'll let Kid stay at your place

357
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,790
to keep you company.

358
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm very generous.

359
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,710
You're so nice.

360
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,870
As your friend,

361
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,150
can I do something for you?

362
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,710
Just stop talking

363
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,910
and quietly

364
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,790
stay here with me

365
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,430
for a little while.

366
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,240
Alex.

367
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,270
Well,

368
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,230
when can you give me

369
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,430
the new designs of men's clothes?

370
00:19:47,900 --> 00:20:01,380
[Soon. The day after tomorrow.]

371
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,780
Jiang Hu took a job at Cloud Footwear.

372
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,310
I'm not surprised at all.

373
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,560
Of course she did.

374
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,510
She won't stay where she falls

375
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,510
and wallow in misery and self-pity.

376
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
However,

377
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,190
in the future, our Teng Yue

378
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,100
and her Cloud Footwear

379
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,390
will be competitors

380
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,550
in the market.

381
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,030
Zhaoyang.

382
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
Actually, the relationship

383
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,600
between you and Jiang Hu

384
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,710
is not as terrible as you two think.

385
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,310
She knows you well.

386
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,790
You know her well too.

387
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,150
You two made a great team.

388
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,710
Yes.

389
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,960
But when I realized that,

390
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,990
I had already hurt her.

391
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,630
I'll never leave Teng Yue.

392
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,510
Teng Yue means as much to her

393
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,000
as it does to me.

394
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,430
Maybe

395
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,960
you can make peace with her.

396
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
Timing is very important

397
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,260
in relationships.

398
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,510
I missed the moment.

399
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,270
So I guess

400
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,550
I have to wait for the next right moment.

401
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,710
You've always

402
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,950
been very sensitive.

403
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,430
Gao Yi.

404
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,720
Do you remember

405
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,990
the first time we met?

406
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,790
The first time we met?

407
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,510
Looks like

408
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,550
you don't remember it.

409
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,230
I was in middle school that year.

410
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,210
Zhaoyang.

411
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,160
Xiang Zhaoyang.

412
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,430
Xiang Zhaoyang!

413
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,190
Zhaoyang.

414
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,430
Zhaoyang.

415
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,080
Zhaoyang, wake up.

416
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,990
You're fine.

417
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,420
You're fine.

418
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,750
That was the first time

419
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,700
someone was willing to help me.

420
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,080
That someone was you.

421
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,140
I remember

422
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,180
that day.

423
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,950
But the person who saved you

424
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,210
was not me.

425
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,960
When I saw you,

426
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,710
Yang Jian

427
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,750
had already brought you

428
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,710
out of the river.

429
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,510
Excuse me.

430
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,310
Zhaoyang.

431
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,400
Zhaoyang.

432
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,490
Xiang Zhaoyang.

433
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,400
Then he left

434
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,740
to settle the score with those boys.

435
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,540
Actually, at that time,

436
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,990
I didn't know that boy

437
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,750
was Yang Jian.

438
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,790
But I recognized him

439
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,380
when we met the other day.

440
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,990
I was surprised

441
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,170
that he was your brother.

442
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,660
-Watch where you're going.
-Mom.

443
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,070
Mom.

444
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,250
What's this?

445
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,990
It's…

446
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,330
It's…

447
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,990
Don't worry.

448
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,320
I won't buy stocks

449
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,420
or mutual funds.

450
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,630
Then what's this?

451
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,140
It's…

452
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,670
Do you remember the thing

453
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,270
with Lili's mom?

454
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,190
Jian took care of it

455
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,190
and

456
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,460
paid the money for me.

457
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,950
I have some savings

458
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,300
but didn't want to pay him back.

459
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,150
So…

460
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,230
I've come around now.

461
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,760
We won't rely on Jian anymore.

462
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,560
I'm going to pay him back.

[Cloud Footwear]

[100-year-old legacy. Excellent quality]

518
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,790
The new collection For Young

519
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,670
represents the courage to try new things.

520
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,150
It's the first time in over 90 years

521
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,310
that Cloud Footwear

522
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,230
has tried to communicate with customers

523
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,430
in the young people's language.

524
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,990
This is

525
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,980
an unprecedented breakthrough.

526
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,880
I think

527
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,240
they look great.

528
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,710
What does this "for" mean?

529
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,950
What is this?

530
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,770
For Young.

531
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,770
For Young?

532
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,550
These are our new products for the next season.

533
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,220
There are hoodies, coats and shoes.

534
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,230
The designer

535
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,030
was born in the 1990s

536
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,750
and won a design prize in Milan.

537
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,680
When did I

538
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,710
allow you to find a designer?

539
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,040
Where did you get the money

540
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,080
to pay for the designs?

541
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
I used what was left of the marketing budget.

542
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,190
I followed the procedure

543
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,990
and made an application

544
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,060
in accordance with the regulations.

545
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,510
All these designs

546
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,510
cost 180,000 yuan in total.

547
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,190
180,000 yuan?

548
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,800
That 180,000 yuan

549
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,910
was all the money

550
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,960
we had left this year.

551
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,110
Zhang, what's going on?

552
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,540
Mr. Ye.

553
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,150
The budget proposal from the Marketing Department

554
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,920
was up to code.

555
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,200
It was detailed and met all the requirements.

556
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,450
So I approved it.

557
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,710
And the designs are paid in installments.

558
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,550
We've only paid less than 50,000 yuan by now.

559
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:42,990
You…

560
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,500
Why didn't you ask for my permission?

561
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,750
You used the marketing budget

562
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,310
to pay for these designs?

563
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,220
You should've talked with me about it!

564
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,990
You spent 180,000 yuan

565
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,870
in one go!

566
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,410
Mr. Ye.

567
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,710
The 180,000 yuan

568
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,990
covers product designs

569
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,630
and the designs

570
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,750
of all promotional materials.

571
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,070
And this award-winning designer

572
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,250
can endorse

573
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,440
Cloud Footwear.

574
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,820
It's good for us.

575
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,550
Endorse?

576
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,410
We don't need endorsement.

577
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,710
You spent

578
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,990
the whole year's marketing budget

579
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,270
in one go!

580
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,470
I think these designs

581
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,230
look great.

582
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,650
Yes.

583
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,670
They're much better

584
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,390
than the old-fashioned ones we have.

585
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,270
I think so too.

586
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,790
They're great.

587
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,390
I disagree!

588
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,270
It's too late.

589
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,470
I've used

590
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,750
Cloud Footwear's business license

591
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,790
to register these designs.

592
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,710
In other words,

593
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,470
whether you want these designs or not,

594
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,990
Cloud Footwear owns them now.

595
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,390
So beautiful.

596
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,000
Look.

597
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,330
They're amazing,

598
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,120
aren't they?

599
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,730
Look at the details.

600
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,550
Look. Young people will love them.

601
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,230
They're really nice.

602
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:53,800
Very chic.

603
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,890
Look at the embroidery.

[Divorce Agreement]

605
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,710
You've signed it?

606
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,430
Okay.

607
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,970
How about

608
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,350
we go to the Civil Affairs Bureau today

609
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,140
and get it done?

610
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,930
Don't rush.

611
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,990
We haven't talked about

612
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,960
the division of assets.

613
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,390
Sit.

614
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,690
Go ahead.

615
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,500
I want Changle Restaurant

616
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,500
and Xixingji.

617
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,130
I don't agree.

618
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,950
It's none of your business.

619
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,680
I'll think about it.

620
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,950
Give me a week.

621
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,580
Okay.

622
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,550
I'll wait for your answer.

623
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,060
Are you serious?

624
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
You'll just let her have what she wants?

625
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,390
Why?

626
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,470
She's gone too far.

627
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,150
I don't agree.

628
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,210
Boss.

629
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,270
What's so good about her

630
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,990
that has made you love her for so many years?

631
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,430
She's never seen you as her husband

632
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,720
yet when she's about to divorce you,

633
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,040
she wants to take away everything you have.

634
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,900
How can she do that?

635
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,890
Enough.

636
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,920
I've seen pushovers

637
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,430
but never one

638
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,260
as hopeless as you.

639
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,190
Stop it.

640
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,570
Have you finished your work?

641
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,790
Go clean the table.

642
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,490
I'm always cleaning the table.

643
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:52,940
What time is it now?

644
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,470
Don't you need

645

to attend a meeting at Cloud Footwear?

646
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,070
What time is it?

647
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,630
I don't agree.

648
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,530
I don't know why Zhaoyang

649
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,670
has made such a ridiculous request

650
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,469
and don't want to know why.

651
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,510
I just want to say,

652
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,900
you don't understand girls.

653
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,830
Neither do I.

654
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,570
So make your decision.

655
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,440
Don't care about the three of us.

656
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,590
At worst, we'll just be beggars.

657
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:39,960
Mr. Ye.

658
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
You're here.

I've been looking for you.

660
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,750

00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,550
these designs too?

667
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:55,590
Yeah.

668
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,720
Okay, I see.

Let's go for a walk.

679
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,750
is going around in a car.

680
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,590
The dog's life is better than mine.

681
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,480
You heard them?

682
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm so good to you.

683
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,110
I always take you for a drive before walking you.

684
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,070
Your mom doesn't want you,

685
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,660
so I have to love you more.

686
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,190
Let's go.

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,920
I want a cup of milk tea. Let's go buy it.

692
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,580
Thanks a lot.

693
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,890
I got to carry so many bags.

694
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,390
I would've been exhausted if I had taken the subway.

695
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,170
I'll go.

696
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,840
Get home safe.

697
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,910
Wait a moment.

I need to tell you something.

700
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,910
I know you think I'm too young for you.

701
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,800
I also know

702
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,040
you may haven't got over Xu Si.

703
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,570
I like you, Jiang Hu.

00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,010
I've liked you for a long time.

705
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,110
So can you give me a chance

706
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,730
to be with you?

707
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,960
You don't have to answer me now.

708
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,870
Go back and think about it.

We're a young entrepreneur team

00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,990
that just came back from abroad.

732
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,990

Simon is so strict.

00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,470
He hasn't passed any project yet.

He's always like that.

00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,110
Hello, everyone.

769
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,790
My name is Jiang Hu.

770
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,870
Jiang Qisheng.

771
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,990
I believe

772
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,630
you all know that name.

773
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,150
Yes.

774
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,410
He was my father.

775
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,710
Unfortunately,

776
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,470
a year ago,

777
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,220
in an accident,

778
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,310
he left

779
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,470
this world forever.

780
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,510
The tree that used to shield me

781
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,390
from this treacherous world was gone.

782
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,120
My life was no longer sunshine and rainbows.

783
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,430
It became a mess.

784
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,550
At the last moment,

785
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,080
I tried my best

786
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,630
and kept

787
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,870
the only thing I could keep

788
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,470
that belonged to the Jiang family:

789
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,370
Teng Yue.

790
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,110
It was once a household name

791
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,110
but when I took it over,

792
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,590
it had fallen off the pedestal

793
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,770
and was hanging by a thread.

794
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,860
At that time,

795
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,130
it felt like I was trying to make something

796
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,720
out of nothing.

797
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,500
I had nothing left

798
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,110
but was in a game

799
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,350
full of traps and dangers.

800
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,020
But one year later,

801
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,330
Teng Yue came back to life

802
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,790
and found its way back

803
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,660
to the center of the stage.

804
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,670
I experienced things

805
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,470
I never did before

806
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,590
and never felt so fulfilled.

807
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:08,900
Of course,

808
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,070
during this process,

809
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,290
I met many great people.

810
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,750
They gave me

811
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,900
a lot of support and help.

812
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,950
I'm very grateful to them.

813
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,870
However,

814
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,210
nothing lasts forever.

815
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,350
Although

816
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,500
I've left Teng Yue

817
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,470
and come to

818
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,090
another 100-year-old company,

819
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,070
Cloud Footwear,

820
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,890
I still believe

821
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,170
that a good brand

822
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,830
deserves to be known and loved

823
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,190
by more people.

824
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,240
The third entrepreneur

825
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:44,990
just came on stage

826
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:45,670
and introduced herself.

827
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,630
I believe she's moved

828
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,630
everyone present

829
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,760
including me.

830
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,590
Before

831
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,100
the third entrepreneur

832
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:51,950
starts sharing

833
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,870
her startup story,

834
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,430
I want to ask

835
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,530
if the tutors

836
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,220
have any questions

837
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,050
for her.

838
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,640
Mr. Xu, do you have anything to say?

839
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,440
Mr. Xu?

840
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,200
Please.

841
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,230
Ms. Jiang.

842
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,900
I'm looking forward to your presentation.
