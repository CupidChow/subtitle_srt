Why are you here?

7
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,140
Do you have your phone?

I went to his room just now.

31

He wasn't in his room either.

What did she say?

She said

40
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,200
that he's sleeping in her room.

41
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,160

43
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,950

Where are we going?

You'll know soon.

49
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,210
Let's go.

50
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,840
You used to wait for me here

51
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,560
whenever school ended

52
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,950
and followed me home secretly.

53
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,950
I was afraid your classmates would bully you.

54
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,380
I know.

55
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,230
But because of this,

56
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,290
I'd been in conflict for many years.

57
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,600
Actually, I didn't want to call you brother since a long time ago.

58
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,670
But it's just that

59
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,910
I really hate your dad.

60
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,790
So,

61
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,970
I wanted to make myself hate you.

62
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,340
I didn't want to admit

63
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,500
that I relied on you a lot.

64
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,270
Even more so, I didn't want to admit

65
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,800
that I liked you.

66
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,730
Since a long time ago?

67
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,470
I remember that year,

68
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,270
when I fell into the river,

69
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,040
I always thought

70
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,750
Gao Yi saved me.

71
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,800
So from that day on,

72
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,530
I treated Gao Yi

73
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,900
as the light of my life.

74
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,150
If I like him,

75
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,910
I could also avoid

76
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,080
the problems that I didn't want to face.

77
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,350
Gradually,

78
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,220
I started to believe

79
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,850
the lies I told to myself.

80
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,940
Maybe in this way,

81
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,950
I didn't have to face

82
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,830
the biggest conflict in my heart.

83
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,750
I didn't know

84
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,179
anything about this.

85
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,760
It's natural that you don't.

86
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,510
Because even I

87
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,600
only figured it out now.

88
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,220
That year,

89
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,230
you were the one who saved me

90
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,990
from the river.

91
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,950
When I found out,

92
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,660
I lost

93
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,470
my last excuse.

94
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,470
Yang Jian.

95
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,270
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

96
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,870
No matter what your dad did before,

97
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,990
it doesn't matter.

98
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,020
What matters is

99
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,000
that you...

100
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,710

to recover your rational judgment

155
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,510
as an investor and resume your cooperation

I've made you worry a lot

161
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,350

162
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,470
I'm really grateful

165
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,320
that you spent a lot of effort

166
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,710
to invite me to join Baoxing back then.

167
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,500
Also, thank you for helping me

168
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,680
see clearly

169
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,950
what the real value

170
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,630
of our profession is

171
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,590
to these industries.

172
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,870
At the same time,

173
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,470
I also realized

174
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,310
what a qualified investor

175
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,220
should

176
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,880
and shouldn't do.

177
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,140
I was right about you.

178
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,190
Your working style

179
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,220
in Hong Kong's investment banking

180
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,360
was similar to mine.

181
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,790
You are ambitious,

182
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,030
know how to find the right targets,

183
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,240
and pursue the greatest return of investment.

184
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,580
After coming to Baoxing,

185
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,630
you've helped me develop

186
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,730
many new businesses.

187
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,590
I have high hopes

188
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,510
for your future.

189
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,230
Leave the past

190
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,230

191
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,190

192
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,540
Thank you for your encouragement.

193
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,320
But I think

194
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,630
I’m no longer suitable

195
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,350
to be the executive director of Baoxing.

196
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,430
At the same time,

197
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,500
I will use my own money

198
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,880
to buy back all of Teng Yue's shares

199
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,790
that Baoxing owns.

200
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,420
I hope you can fulfill my wish again.

201
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,190
Do you understand

202
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,750
what you just said?

203
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,550
According to the exit profit

204
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,380
that you just approved,

205
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,640
I will give you

206
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,800
what Baoxing deserves,

207
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,620
not a penny less.

208
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,290
I thought

209
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,830
that after my last warning,

210
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,950
as a

211
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,190
calm and smart investor,

212
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,510
you won't do

213
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,770
anything ridiculous again.

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,600
But I think

215
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,430
that for an investor,

216
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,710
it's more important

217
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,080
to have a professional bottom line.

218
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,660
Mr. Xu.

219
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,300
Mr. Gao.

220
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,480
Let's talk.

221
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,110
A year ago,

222
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,870
the news of Peace Loan's Shen Gui going missing

223
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,000
was spread to the market

224
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
by Baoxing.

225
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,010
I think you know this.

226
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,210
What do you mean by that?

227
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,730
I mean it literally.

228
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,630
You don't have to

229
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,760
act in front of me.

230
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I just hope

231
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,430
that Jiang Hu will no longer

232
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,230
get hurt because of

233
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,590
something like that.

234
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,010
I don't think you have the right

235
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,400
to say that in front of me.

236
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,840
That's right.

237
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,810
I spread the news.

238
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,500
This is a very normal thing

239
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,490
in the investment market.

240
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,510
Until recently, I realized that

241
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,760
you and I have different standards

242
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,830
for what's considered

243
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,070
as normal.

244
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,880
Because until now,

245
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,310
you're still

246
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,630
not a mature investor.

247
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,230
Besides,

248
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,110
you didn't keep my warning

249
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,510
in your mind.

250
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,500
Warning?

251
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,470
Am I supposed to take full responsibility

252
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,680
of Aneda's scheme?

253
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,960
Do you know

254
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,590
what kind of implications

255
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,840
your decision today will have?

256
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,040
Are you afraid that me losing everything

257
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,790
will affect the grand scheme of things?

258
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,480
I'm sure you've seen my skills.

259
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,350
I believe I'll do well

260
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,290
this time too.

261
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,990
By the way,

262
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,310
I've talked to

263
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,470
the CEO of Hero Fly

264
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,560
for three rounds.

265
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,290
They are very interested in

266
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,960
mergers and acquisitions of Chinese enterprises

267
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,030
to join the Chinese market.

268
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,140
But as for the price,

269
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,900
we'll negotiate it with them

270
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,880
after your field inspection

271
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,390
at Aalborg.

272
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:19,910
By the way,

273
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,310
I've actually been meaning to ask you this.

274
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,950
Boss,

275
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,390
we've done our due diligence

276
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,710
in assessing many Nordic brands.

277
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,750
Why are you so interested

278
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,550
in Hero Fly?

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,040
Because Hero Fly

280
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,230
is the only one

281
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,630
that is a hiking shoes brand

282
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,870
with a century-old history.

283
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,300
Aneda needs it very much.

284
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,190
The high-spirited

285
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,470
Chinese brand Aneda

286
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,230
acquiring a century-old foreign brand

287
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,340
will be a good story in the market.

288
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,990
The heir of the Hansen family,

289
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,470
Hero Fly's major shareholder,

290
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,660
owes a lot of external debts.

291
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,430
So at this moment,

292
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,180
they also need Aneda.

293
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,790
Interesting.

294
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,950
I didn't expect things would end up

295
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,750
like this.

296
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,480
Are you satisfied with this deal?

297
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,240
Although the process was a bit unpleasant,

298
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,720
the result now

299
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,870
is much better

300
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,190
than before.

301
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,990
By then, the European media

302
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,510
will also report

303
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,310
about this acquisition.

304
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,070
So the compounding effect of the news

305
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,870
will make the deal even more valuable.

306
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,470
Speed is the key.

307
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,230
Let's sign the contract as soon as possible.

308
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,600
Aneda

309
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,710
has approved

310
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,150
the acquisition proposal of Hero Fly.

311
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,380
They want to sign the contract as soon as possible.

312
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,230
I will finish the work

313
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,190
for this

314
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,150
before I quit.

315
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,720
In this way,

316
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,990
no one in your scheme,

317
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,790
which includes you and Baoxing,

318
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,800
Mei Shaowang and Jingyang,

319
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,190
and Aneda,

320
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,350
will make any losses.

321
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,440
What a pity.

322
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,670
What a huge pity.

323
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,530
Not at all.

324
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,070
Why can't I understand

325
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,620
why a talented man like you

326
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,430
has to make

327
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,220
such a stupid decision?

328
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,590
As I said,

329
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,710
please fulfill my wish.

330
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,110
You calculated the cost for

331
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,950
buying back Teng Yue's shares.

332
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,720
You should know it

333
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,320
better than anyone.

334
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,230
That cost is nothing

335
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,560
to Aneda.

336
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,470
But you'll need to

337
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,990
fork out your entire fortune.

338
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,230
There are difficulties

339
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,510
in everything.

340
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,160
I want to give it a try.

341
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,390
Maybe this is

342
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,200
what I can and cannot do.

343
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,880
Mr. Du,

344
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,710
on account that my performance has been decent

345
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,430
since I entered Baoxing,

346
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,460
I hope that you can give me a week

347
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,950
to raise funds

348
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,720
to buy back Teng Yue's shares.

349
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,510
Okay.

350
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,300
I'll give you one week.

351
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,870
To prove your immaturity.

352
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:27,750
Thank you.

353
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,090
What's the matter, Boss?

354
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,650
Are we

355
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,590
switching jobs

356
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,300
or starting a business?

357
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,550
I'll follow you.

358
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,890
Help me borrow money first.

359
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,220
Borrow money?

360
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,930
What money?

361
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,220
A lot of money.

362
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,350
He's just kidding.

363
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,920
Don't take it seriously.

364
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,240
Stop with those fancy ideas

365
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,150
of yours.

366
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,040
I'm the marketing director.

367
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,770
I have to be responsible for the sales.

368
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,080
I'm the factory director.

369
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,570
I have the final say.

370
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,070
But if we

371
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,400
suddenly cancel the livestream,

372
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,920
the consequences...

373
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,700
Well,

374
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,120
just do as I say.

375
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,270
We can sell the shoes at a profit

376
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,750
and give it back

377
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,930
to our customers.

378
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,680
We shouldn't be

379
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,870
sitting in front of the camera

380
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,030
and blabbering on.

381
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,360
Okay, I'll listen to you.

382
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,310
You'll listen to me?

383
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
I'll inform them

384
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,230
to cancel the livestream right away.

385
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,130
She's suddenly become so obedient.

386
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,320
No way.

387
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,790
I always thought

388
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,550
drinking with a broken heart

389
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,710
is just a concept,

390
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,670
until you set an example to prove it.

391
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,330
So this is mental dependence.

392
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,550
Do you want a drink?

393
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,670
Are you

394
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,070
trying to make up for not rebelling when you were young?

395
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,340
Because of a woman,

396
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,610
you're in a mess.

397
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,230
Instead of getting out,

398
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,310
you even want to

399
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,960
jump into a high-risk losing business.

400
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,850
Aneda

401
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,840
is more satisfied about Hero Fly

402
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,750
than Teng Yue.

403
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,550
And Jingyang Capital's

404
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,430
KPI for this season

405
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,710
is great.

406
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,570
Which point

407
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,800
proves that we've jumped into a high-risk losing business?

408
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,420
Let's talk about it one by one.

409
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,660
Yes.

410
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,030
You're using Hero Fly

411
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,230
to fill Teng Yue's pit.

412
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,400
But you're

413
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,230
jumping into the pit Teng Yue dug for you.

414
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,960
That's what I meant by

415
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,750
high-risk losing business.

416
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,070
So?

417
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,060
Are you trying to be righteous

418
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,600
and help me out?

419
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,730
No thank you.

420
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,920
I'm just chatting with you.

421
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,540
Don't try to get me involved.

422
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,770
Let me tell you in advance.

423
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,070
At this stage,

424
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,910
there's no way

425
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,070
I'll jump into the pit

426
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,630
with you.

427
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,790
See you in the next stage then.

428
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,290
Sure.

429
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,870
Here.

430
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,390
Mom?

431
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,230
You're back.

432
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,100
Kid.

433
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:30,480
Go.

434
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,070
What are you doing here?

435
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,550
Be careful, it's hot.

436
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,810
You haven't

437
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,470
been home for a meal for a long time.

438
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,960
No matter how busy you are, take care of yourself.

439
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,170
I've prepared

440
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,280
your favorite soup.

441
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,270
When you return to Teng Yue,

442
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,910
take it with you.

443
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,280
Thank you, Mom.

444
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,190
Recently...

445
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,230
Mom.

446
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,510
Don't worry.

447
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,950
I'll take care of everything.

448
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,910
Xu Si.

449
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,200
In the past,

450
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,290
in business,

451
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,220
we had

452
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
many disagreements.

453
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,580
As you always say,

454
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,320
we're from different generations

455
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,900
who've lived in different environments.

456
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,940
We have different opinions on problems

457
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,400
and different working styles.

458
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,180
Every generation

459
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,320
has their own business jargon.

460
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,710
We can't persuade the other.

461
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,640
But there's one thing

462
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,870
that I can understand

463
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,370
how you think.

464
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,230
Mom.

465
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,850
These days,

466
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,580
I gradually figured out

467
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,830
that the best ecological landscape for Chinese brands

468
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,520
is to have diverse

469
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,780
quality brands,

470
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,770
instead of just a few major brands.

471
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,290
As investors,

472
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,100
our biggest value

473
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,150
is

474
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,910
to help these companies find a chance

475
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,130
to let them develop.

476
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,590
Yes.

477
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,860
Many businesses

478
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,030
may be small

479
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,080
and take a long time to develop,

480
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,540
but they can

481
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,590
be more solid

482
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,940
in terms of core competitiveness.

483
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,140
In this way,

484
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,520
they have better long-term prospects.

485
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,630
Now,

486
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,760
many companies need

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
to go through this process.

488
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,340
Mom.

489
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,160
Hang on.

490
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,940
This is

491
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,600
the material of an e-commerce proxy operations agency team.

492
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,280
The core members of the team

493
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,070
are from

494
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,440
professional advertising companies

495
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,990
and e-commerce subsidiaries.

496
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,310
Many of the team's designers

497
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,970
have won the Red Dot Design Grand Award.

498
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,150
And their

499
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,790
online distribution channels

500
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,990
are also quite abundant.

501
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,120
This is the brand improvement proposal

502
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,270
they made for Xufeng.

503
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,660
I believe...

504
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,540
I believe you.

505
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,530
I'll contact them soon

506
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,840
and talk about cooperation.

507
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,620
Why are you looking at me like that?

508
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,760
Did you think

509
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,590
my answer would be "no"?

510
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,420
I just didn't expect it.

511
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,490
You agreed so quickly this time.

512
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,910
I'm surprised.

513
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,640
In the past,

514
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,030
I refused

515
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,530
people you recommended to Xufeng

516
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,140
because at that time,

517
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,210
you weren't clear

518
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,730
about what you need,

519
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,390
what I need,

520
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,420
and what your dad needs,

521
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,400
from Xufeng Factory.

522
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,370
But this time,

523
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,610
you've thought everything through.

524
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,970
Your team

525
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,680
has even planned out

526
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,150
the future of Xufeng Factory.

527
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,830
It's because

528
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,600
the way I judged value was too simplistic

529
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,260
and arbitrary.

530
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,550
I was wrong.

531
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,520
I never thought about

532
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,990
what my dad

533
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,180
would want back then.

534
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,490
I only cared about my feelings.

535
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:58,810
If my dad

536
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,300
really wanted to sell the factory,

537
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,030
he wouldn't have gone back to repair the machine.

538
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,590
Xu Si.

539
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,600
From now on,

540
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,110
no matter what you decide to do,

541
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,220
I and our family

542
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,780
will support you.

543
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,880
Do everything boldly.

544
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,870
I want to

545
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,060
apologize to everyone.

546
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,150
I'm really sorry.

547
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,760
Although two days ago,

548
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,590
there was a preview

549
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,000
that I'll recommend Cloud Footwear's

550
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,670
latest For Young series,

551
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,460
you know me best.

552
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,970
When I recommend something to you,

553
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,470
it must be

554
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,830
of the best quality

555
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,990
with the lowest price online.

556
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,630
Actually, I've been talking

557
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,270
with their boss over the past few days.

558
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,910
Just now, even before the broadcast,

559
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,260
I was still talking to them

560
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,030
to help you

561
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,510
get the lowest price online.

562
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,380
Since they aren't willing

563
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,240
to give me the price,

564
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,580
I'd rather not do it.

565
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,600
Yes.

566
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,360
So,

567
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,790
some of you may ask

568
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,790
if I'll continue

569
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,090
working with Cloud Footwear.

570
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,680
I think everything depends on fate.

571
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,560
But the premise is always the lowest price.

572
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,990
This is what I, Tao Xiaoying,

573
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,550
can promise to everyone.

574
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,830
Let's continue with

575
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,690
today's livestream.

576
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,420
Boss.

577
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,090
Cloud Footwear is trending again.

578
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,320
What's wrong?

579
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,500
Tao Xiaoying was

580
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,690
originally

581
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,110
going to promote Cloud Footwear's new products

582
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,580
in her livestream last night.

583
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,330
But at the last minute,

584
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,160
Cloud Footwear cancelled

585
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,650
their collaboration.

586
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,490
Did Cloud Footwear explain themselves?

587
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,510
Explain what?

588
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,470
Their official Weibo account

589
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,430
is already flooded with negative comments

590
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,070
by Tao Xiaoying fans.

591
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,100
They're on full attack mode.

592
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,040
And Cloud Footwear didn’t disable their comments?

593
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
No.

594
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,710
Neither did they delete the comments.

595
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,030
I think

596
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,030
they're providing an outlet

597
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,730
for the fans to vent.

598
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,910
There's another possibility.

599
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,390
She was fooled.

600
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,240
A top host

601
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,780
like Tao Xiaoying

602
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
would have received a deposit

603
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,380
to promote a product.

604
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,220
That's right.

605
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,790
And I think

606
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,380
it’s not like Jiang Hu

607
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,690
to go back on her word.

608
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,270
This is her style.

609
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,230
I think

610
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,810
that if Cloud Footwear

611
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,510
wanted to cancel at the last minute,

612
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,820
they should have

613
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,370
talked things through with Tao Xiaoying and appeased her

614
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,380
in advance.

615
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,560
No matter how famous or obnoxious she is,

616
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,950
if they offered her something to appease her,

617
00:30:59,330 --> 00:30:59,930
this wouldn't

618
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,680
have happened.

619
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,420
Maybe there is another explanation.

620
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,660
The current situation

621
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,650
is what she wants everyone to see.

622
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,400
What benefit can she gain from that?

623
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,970
It's not beneficial at all.

624
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,930
Find some self-media outlets

625
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,830
to join in the attack of Cloud Footwear

626
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,330
to make it trend even more.

627
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,200
Is this the benefit you're talking about?

628
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,790
Wait,

629
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,440
you're kind of

630
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,320
taking advantage of the situation and hitting her when she's down.

631
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,240
Although you and Jiang Hu

632
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,180
fell out,

633
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,290
I think

634
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,490
we still can't

635
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,930
use this to hurt others.

636
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,470
Right?

637
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,150
-We have our bottom line.
-Wu Guanglei, oh, Wu Guanglei.

638
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,710
Is

639
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,120
the annual salary I'm giving you

640
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,270
too high?

641
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,020
Go and contact them now.

642
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
What should we do?

643
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,540
This morning,

644
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,120
the distributors of Hetian Trading

645
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,190
called and asked about it.

646
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,720
I explained so much

647
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,500
that

648
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,020
my throat is hoarse.

649
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,910
I can't talk anymore.

650
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:10,860
It's just that

651
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,710
we've never

652
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,900
experienced this kind of thing.

653
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,880
What should we do?

654
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,990
Why don't we just wait it out?

655
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,990
We'll be cursed at for a few days at most

656
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,730
and they'll get over it.

657
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,700
That won't do.

658
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,690
If we don't speak up,

659
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,120
the narrative would be in others' hands.

660
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,610
They'll say we're not honest and trustworthy.

661
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,640
But no matter what we say now,

662
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,310
it won't appease anyone.

663
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,170
Why don’t we just wait it out?

664
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,990
Jiang?

665
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,630
Jiang.

666
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,910
Why are you so quiet?

667
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,440
Aren't you full of ideas?

668
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,230
Say something.

669
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,310
Say something.

670
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,760
I...

671
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,480
I listen to Mr. Ye.

672
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,430
Mr. Ye

673
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,160
was vehement when he decided to cancel the livestream.

674
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,470
He must have already thought of

675
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,600
a solution.

676
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,890
Right, Mr. Ye?

677
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,690
Mr. Ye.

678
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,950
Let's listen to

679
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,270
what the young person thinks.

680
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,410
Jiang,

681
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,820
just say it boldly.

682
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,080
I...

683
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,740
Then, let me tell you what I think.

684
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,220
Forget it.

685
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,900
Forget it.

686
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,670
No, no, no.

687
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,750
Speak up.

688
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,710
This time,

689
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,800
I'll listen to you.

690
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,410
Just this time?

691
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,750
How dare you bargain with me?

692
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,430
How are you

693
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,170
an employee?

694
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,800
You're acting

695
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,190
like you're God.

696
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,390
Then...

697
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,290
Then, I'll just keep quiet.

698
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,440
We'll just listen to you.

699
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,380
I won't say anything.

700
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:34,890
I won't.

701
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,960
You'll anger me to my wit's end sooner or later.

702
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,670
Right?

703
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,790
Forget it.

704
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,550
I don't care anymore.

705
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,010
It's up to everyone.

706
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,410
As long as we don't have to

707
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,510
shut down the factory,

708
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,220
I'm fine with it.

709
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,190
Young people have their own ideas.

710
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,450
We have to follow the trend.

711
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,840
This...

712
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,190
[Cloud Footwear's Apology Letter]

713
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,969
Cloud Footwear has released an announcement.

714
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,350
What did they say?

715
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,300
Look.

716
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,750
It's exactly what you thought.

717
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,219
First,

718
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,489
they issued an apology letter.

719
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,870
And then,

720
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,150
they

721
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,190
explained it through Tao Xiaoying's logic

722
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,510
of acquiring

723
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,440
the lowest price.

724
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,560
Everything is because

725
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,500
of the price.

726
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,670
Spreading the spirit of 100-year craftsmanship

727
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,810
and building a century-old brand

728
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,730
has been possible because everyone in Cloud Footwear

729
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,920
strictly

730
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,870
and sincerely adheres to the management standards.

731
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,350
We don't want to

732
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,860
compromise the quality

733
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,900
in exchange for sales.

734
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,960
Are you not eating this?

735
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,240
Cloud Footwear's just

736
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,790
upholding their own quality standards.

737
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,120
Why didn’t Cloud Footwear

738
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,280
apologize to Tao Xiaoying?

739
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,700
So what if they lower the price?

740
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,730
If the quality suffers, it'll be in vain.

741
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,520
I support Tao Xiaoying

742
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,600
for helping her fans get the best deals.

743
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,320
Show some support and understanding

744
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,960
to an old Chinese brand.

745
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,720
I didn't expect that making a pair of shoes

746
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,730
would be so troublesome and cost so much.

747
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,040
A century-old brand.

748
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,840
You're wearing culture and history.

749
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,160
No middleman makes a profit.

750
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,320
It feels like a loss not to buy

751
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,070
the For Youth series.

752
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,220
It's not just for nostalgia,

753
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,840
Chinese products are also trendy.

754
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,950
Wuhu couple's fans will always show our support.

755
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,470
Cloud Footwear's shoes are really comfortable.

756
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,360
It has been verified for four generations.

757
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,630
In marketing,

758
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,920
Jiang Hu's method

759
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,310
is really amazing.

760
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,270
To uphold the brand's quality

761
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,440
or get the best deal for one's fans?

762
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,030
This is a hot topic

763
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,480
on the internet.

764
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,230
The topic itself is promoting Cloud Footwear.

765
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,510
The number of readers

766
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,740
has reached 5.6 billion.

767
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,920
The number of participants

768
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,350
has reached 39,000.

769
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,880
In 24 hours,

770
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,080
it's been a top trending topic three times.

771
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,380
After this incident,

772
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
Cloud Footwear's sales

773
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,620
can be doubled.

774
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,370
It's free promotion

775
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,240
from a livestreaming influencer.

776
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,230
It also improved

777
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,250
the reputation of Cloud Footwear.

778
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,310
Even that

779
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,870
Tao Xiaoying

780
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,070
gained tens of thousands of followers

781
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,560
in a day

782
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,200
and stabilized her position as the top promoter.

783
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,730
It's killing two birds with one stone.

784
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,550
When you are free,

785
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,910
come to Teng Yue.

786
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,290
Kill three birds with one stone.

787
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,280
In my opinion,

788
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:33,980
Mr. Mei

789
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,050
is like a predator who only shows up

790
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,960
when there's a prey.

791
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,280
This time, he should be convinced of

792
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,590
Jiang Hu's ability and vision

793
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,600
and have confidence

794
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,630
in Teng Yue's future.

795
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,230
You've finally improved.

796
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,350
But I think

797
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,550
Mr. Mei

798
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,450
is conservative.

799
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,320
He won't invest a lot.

800
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,110
It can't support

801
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,950
the entire investment

802
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,840
of the whole Smart Production Line

803
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,830
and all the shares

804
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,070
of Teng Yue Factory that you've to buy back.

805
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,760
I don't plan

806
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,190
to let Mr. Mei control Teng Yue.

807
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,670
For the clothing and shoes industrial park

808
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,870
in Chengnan Economic Development Zone,

809
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,960
I've already made a deal.

810
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
They will invest in

811
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,770
the Smart Production Line

812
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,870
to attract more enterprises

813
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,730
to join the industrial park.

814
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,750
Teng Yue will be one of them.

815
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,520
I will also

816
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,270
mortgage all my fixed assets

817
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,220
under my name.

818
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,030
Plus,

819
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,470
with what we've raised before,

820
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,070
we should be able

821
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,150
to solve this problem completely.

822
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,830
Did I hear it right?

823
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,260
Are you crazy?

824
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,300
All

825
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,030
your fixed assets?

826
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,640
I don't understand.

827
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,230
Jiang Hu's doesn't have the beauty...

828
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,180
worthy of...

829
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,750
overthrowing a country.

830
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,660
What are you doing?

831
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,600
You must be crazy.

832
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,430
And your brother... This sure is interesting.

833
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,930
He'll find out that you're doing this.

834
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,360
You...

835
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,190
Are you crazy?

836
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,610
I look forward to working with you.

837
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,810
Okay.

838
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,160
I accept your pit fees

839
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,020
and commissions.

840
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,440
Ms. Jiang is much more flexible than before.

841
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,670
But I think

842
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,620
you are not as smart as before.

843
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,460
This little money from Cloud Footwear

844
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,000
is not the most important thing

845
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,840
to you now.

846
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,880
Then what is the most important?

847
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,670
I don't even know.

848
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,700
Maintaining popularity and staying on trending topics.

849
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,020
Over the past three months,

850
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,780
your style has been imitated by many people.

851
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,150
And it's been a long time

852
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,070
since there's any news.

853
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,580
But Nan, who's not very different from your style

854
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,110
and is the biggest threat to you,

855
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,900
was repositioned by TT Media

856
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,330
and became the top makeup artist

857
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,660
for amateurs.

858
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,310
He must have taken away a lot of

859
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,470
your fans and popularity.

860
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,820
At this rate,

861
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,240
you'll be out of the top five soon.

862
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,550
Aren't you nervous?

863
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,850
If you want to stay in your current position,

864
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,270
you need to focus on popularity and positioning

865
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,630
before money.

866
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,300
If you're trending

867
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,590
and have precise positioning,

868
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,040
the money will come along naturally.

869
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:22,990
And for that,

870
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,300
I can help you do it.

871
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,660
Ms. Jiang.

872
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,130
What you really want to do

873
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,470
is to associate Cloud Footwear

874
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,070
with my name,

875
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,950
right?

876
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,830
Isn't the definition of cooperation

877
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,550
to fulfill what each party needs?

878
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,440
In the future, you can come to me if Cloud Footwear

879
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,190
needs someone to do livestreaming commerce.

880
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,270
I'll exempt you from the commission.

881
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,850
Aren't you going to exempt me for the pit fees?

882
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,980
That depends on what you can give me.

883
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,510
But we've been

884
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,720
cooperating very well so far.

885
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,660
Everything is negotiable.

886
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,410
I'm leaving.

887
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,680
See you again if we have the chance.
