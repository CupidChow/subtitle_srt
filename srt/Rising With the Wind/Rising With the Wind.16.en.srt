5
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,420
I heard you majored in design,

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,190
and you worked in big companies before.

7
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,270
It's understandable that

8
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,990
you're conceited.

9
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,470
You won't easily admit

10
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,310
that your aesthetics are rustic.

11
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,080
But

12
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,840
keeping an open mind

13
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,190
to learn from others

14
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,490
is the foundation of our cooperation.

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,850
Learn from others?

16
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,180
You mean

17
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,220
you want me to plagiarize

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,080
the works of foreign designers?

19
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,350
Wrong.

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,699
It's to pay tribute to them

21
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,690
and draw on their works.

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,760
To pay tribute to them and

23
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,520
draw on their works?

24
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,920
You are much too modest.

25
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,940
Doesn't your app

26
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,240
just digitalize

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,670
literature works

28
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,470
and provide users with

29
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,170
the function of article extracting, piecing, and laundering?

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,829
To put it bluntly,

31
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,460
you help users plagiarize.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,230
Have you ever considered

33
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,960
the legal risks of this?

34
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,020
Mr. Xu.

35
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,890
As the saying goes, "writing is borrowing".

36
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,430
Besides, we've started

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,350
to research and develop

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,490
the function of self-inspection for users

39
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,480
specially to avoid

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
these risks.

41
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,890
This is the trial version

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,400
which has been sold on our online store.

43
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,030
It's very popular.

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,590
This is the sales data

45
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,390
for the past three months.

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,520
Now,

47
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,050
the number of web novel authors nationwide

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,030
has exceeded 10 million.

49
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,790
Many leading companies' intellectual property departments

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,830
are using

51
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,150
the product logic we developed

52
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,940
to create.

53
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,480
They've attained

54
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,670
considerable profits.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,550
It's safe to say that

56
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,920
our market prospect

57
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,390
is very promising.

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,550
Did you

59
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,710
lose something?

60
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,500
What is it?

61
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,420
Your moral integrity.

62
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,230
I suspect

63
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,670
you don't even have it at all.

64
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,350
When did plagiarism

65
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,829
become the creativity of entrepreneurs?

66
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,350
This kind of creativity

67
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,550
not only does not promote

68
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,390
the development of the industry,

69
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,350
but also ruins the creativity of all the practitioners

70
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,850
in the industry.

71
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,270
Even if people call it plagiarism,

72
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,310
so what?

73
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,170
We're not the first,

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,960
and definitely not

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,270
the last company

76
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,070
to imitate foreign designers.

77
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,350
I'm starting to miss

78
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,570
the old Free Unicorn.

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,540
Although the design of the old Free Unicorn

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,280
was a bit obsolete and outdated,

81
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:02,940
they'd never

82
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,690
plagiarize.

83
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,550
Well, it turns out

84
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,790
being conservative

85
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,610
and refusing to keep up with the trends

86
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,300
means falling behind the times.

87
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,470
That's why

88
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,800
Free Unicorn's president

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,230
is Mr. Zhang now.

90
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,360
It's true that plagiarism

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,640
can't be eradicated.

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,350
But I must respect

93
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,470
the works that

94
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,910
the designers put their blood, sweat, and tears in.

95
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,940
Ms. Xiang.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,050
We are very sincere

97
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,640
about this cooperation.

98
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,570
And our offer

99
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,300
is quite high.

100
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,750
Thank you. I'm flattered.

101
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,800
I dare not say

102
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm a noble person,

103
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,480
but at least,

104
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,780
I stick to moral integrity.

105
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,690
I'm sorry, Song Zhi.

106
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,830
Whatever the consequence is,

107
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,230
I'll take it.

108
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,909
I won't

109
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,480
take on this project

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,470
no matter what.

111
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,820
Xiang Zhaoyang.

112
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,920
You're just an influencer.

113
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,720
Being an influencer

114
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,670
is also a dignified profession.

115
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,620
Ms. Song.

116
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,630
The professionalism of your company's influencers

117
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,200
needs to be improved.

118
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
We dare not

119
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,760
work with people like her.

120
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,690
But of course, I recognize

121
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,050
the strength of your company.

122
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,310
I'll tell Mr. Zhang about it.

123
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,630
How about this?

124
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,250
Help me find

125
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,640
another influencer who can do freehand painting.

126
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,650
What matters the most is not ability,

127
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,909
but modesty.

128
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,950
What can I say?

129
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,800
Xiang Zhaoyang is already

130
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,590
the most modest influencer illustrator in our company.

131
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,800
It seems that TT Media

132
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,390
doesn't have the privilege of cooperating with you this time.

133
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,270
By the way,

134
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,720
please tell Mr. Zhang that

135
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,280
I sincerely suggest you

136
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,550
replicate the works directly

137
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,780
instead of finding illustrators to launder them.

138
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,160
This way, you'll get lawsuits.

139
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,640
What a great opportunity for free publicity,

140
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,590
am I right?

141
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,470
Thomas.

142
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,150
There's no need to follow up

143
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,990
this kind of teams in the future.

144
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
It's a waste of time.

145
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,920
You don't have to be so moralistic about it.

146
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,110
The external financing environment is bad.

147
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,790
I think the entertainment industry is great.

148
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,560
The investment cycle is short and the return is high.

149
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,030
Besides, my principle of investment

150
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,100
has always been that

151
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,840
the capital turnover must be fast.

152
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
I agree with the last sentence you just said.

153
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,590
But the premise is

154
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,590
the projects we invest in

155
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,030
shall not harm the industry ecology.

156
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,510
This is about professional ethics.

157
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,030
You're quite weird today.

158
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,170
You're full of witty lines.

159
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,070
Are you planning to change your career

160
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,260
and become an industry mentor?

161
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,140
Fine.

162
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,550
Since you don't like

163
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,350
our project,

164
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,710
the Investment Committee won't approve it either.

165
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,290
It's all for nothing.

166
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,830
I need to find a place to cool off.

167
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,520
I'm leaving.

168
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,430
Mr. Xu, shall we serve the dishes?

169
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,590
Yes.

170
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,310
Mr. Xu, are you eating alone?

171
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,460
Do you want to return some dishes?

172
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,250
No. I have a good appetite today.

173
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,960
The color of braised pork is different.

174
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,290
You changed your chef?

175
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,790
Of course you'd notice it,

176
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,350
as an expert in Shanghai cuisine.

177
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,620
Chef Lin, who cooks the best

178
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,570
braised pork in our restaurant,

179
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,590
was poached.

180
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,310
He got poached?

181
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,630
Even high salaries failed to keep him.

182
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
You should reflect on yourselves.

183
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,980
But it was our former VIP, Ms. Jiang,

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
who poached him.

185
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,210
Ms. Jiang? Which Ms. Jiang?

186
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,320
Ms. Jiang.

187
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,170
That Ms. Jiang

188
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,910
who's full of surprises.

189
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,900
She poached Chef Lin

190
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,830
to cook staff meals at Teng Yue Factory.

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,670
She can offer

192
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,280
a higher salary than yours?

193
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,710
Chef Lin's relatives

194
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,400
didn't do well in their pork business

195
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,400
last year.

196
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,590
Ms. Jiang introduced some clients

197
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,780
to Chef Lin.

198
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,659
So he left.

199
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,520
Xiang Zhaoyang.

200
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,810
Stop there.

201
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,870
Do you want to learn the trick of talking back

202
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,480
which can piss the other person off

203
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,350
without being angry yourself

204
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,230
from me?

205
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,110
Get in.

206
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,650
[Ziyouqi Group]

207
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,240
I didn't expect

208
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,470
you would

209
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,350
talk to them like that today.

210
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,730
This is not like you.

211
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,110
Can't I turn clients down

212
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,230
for the sake of moral integrity?

213
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,360
Unless...

214
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,860
You've got a better client?

215
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,360
Sorry, I'm late.

216
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:07,790
Hello.

217
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,990
What would you like to drink?

218
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,900
One black coffee, please.

219
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,460
Okay.

220
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,580
So what do you think of

221
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,680
Shangchun Art Project?

222
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,760
The conditions for cooperation are pretty good,

223
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,870
but there's one thing I don't understand.

224
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,710
Didn't Baoxing

225
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,270
already quit

226
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,440
when you first got listed?

227
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,640
Why are you

228
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
here in person

229
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
to help facilitate the cooperation between the two companies now?

230
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,940
Because my dad

231
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,440
is an old friend of Mr. Hua.

232
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,350
But of course,

233
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,560
you can think of it another way.

234
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,630
You can take it as

235
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,910
Baoxing's post-investment service is permanent.

236
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,780
After all,

237
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,310
Baoxing's wish is for everyone to be happy.

238
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,670
Thank you then, Mr. Du,

239
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,540
for looking out for us.

240
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,540
You're welcome.

241
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,860
You're both enterprises under Baoxing Group.

242
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,120
We all hope you can reach cooperation.

243
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,320
Let me ask you something.

244
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,030
Do you have to report

245
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,710
all your work progress to Xu Si?

246
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,130
For example,

247
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
he knows about the cooperation

248
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,060
on Shangchun Art Project, right?

249
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,140
Yes, as you said,

250
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,780
Baoxing's wish is for everyone to be happy.

251
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,130
Mr. Xu does a great job in post-investment service

252
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,910
for our good.

253
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,240
He's very strict with us

254
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,590
in business.

255
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,960
Is there anything wrong?

256
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,180
Nothing. Have some coffee.

257
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,830
[Executive Director]

258
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,030
The brands Nan works with

259
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,570
are too homogeneous.

260
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,350
Also,

261
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,630
Big Bird must complete

262
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,010
pay-for-knowledge transformation this year.

263
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,890
This is

264
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,200
the key content business

265
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,830
you should focus on this year.

266
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,470
As for Shangchun Art Project,

267
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,230
I'll choose Zhaoyang

268
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,100
to work with them.

269
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,440
She does a lot of Chinese-style freehand painting.

270
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,830
It matches

271
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,490
their brand positioning of Chinese-style makeup.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Come in.

273
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,130
That's all.

274
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,630
I have something to tell you.

275
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,210
What's up?

276
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,380
Last night,

277
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,730
Teng Yue put on a big show.

278
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,430
Last night,

279
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,020
even Jiang Hu went nuts.

280
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,060
You know what?

281
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,390
The director of the factory's production workshop

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,980
stole from them.

283
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,560
They caught him red-handed.

284
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,710
He was fired on the spot.

285
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,340
But they are quite frank about it.

286
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,440
They wrote this incident

287
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,320
on their

288
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,290
daily work report.

289
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,610
Think about it.

290
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
Their future...

291
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,120
Where are you going?

292
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,830
What's the rush?

293
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,610
Can't you give it more time?

294
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
The factory will do better.

295
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:31,770
You...

296
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,110
Master Zhang.

297
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:38,930
Hey.

298
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,730
Why are you leaving too?

299
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,350
Liu Jun said

300
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,760
there's more work to do there.

301
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,130
What should we do?

302
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,390
I received a few resignation reports

303
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,450
today.

304
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,830
They all speak with one voice.

305
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,750
They refuse

306
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,150
to do their work handover in a month.

307
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,640
They want to leave right away.

308
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,230
What do you plan to do?

309
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,290
Let those who want to leave

310
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,870
go.

311
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,440
Have you ever thought that

312
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,710
the shortage of manpower is a problem?

313
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,830
I'm afraid that

314
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,510
we won't be able to complete Free Unicorn's order in time.

315
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,630
[Teng Yue]

316
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,390
Why are you here?

317
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,200
You guys talk.

318
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,120
Call me anytime if you need anything.

319
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,420
What's up?

320
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,640
Why didn't you tell me

321
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,980
you went to see Liu Jun last night?

322
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,890
Nothing happened.

323
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,400
What would you like to drink?

324
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll order a takeout for you.

325
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,250
Milk tea?

326
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,070
Don't change the subject.

327
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,490
You hurt your hand last night, didn't you?

328
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,830
Well,

329
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,070
I don't understand what this is about.

330
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you holding me accountable or what?

331
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,590
You are a girl.

332
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,350
You went to see Liu Jun in the middle of the night.

333
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,870
What if he got mad

334
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,070
and acted on impulse?

335
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,570
It's already been dealt with.

336
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,000
Besides,

337
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,340
Yang Jian and Jiu were there too.

338
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
I'm all right, aren't I?

339
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,270
You'd rather ask Yang Jian for help

340
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,890
instead of me?

341
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,950
Boss. You are my boss.

342
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,470
You shouldn't bother with

343
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,270
such trivial matters of management.

344
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,110
Besides,

345
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,140
I've taken care of it, haven't I?

346
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,410
I'm really okay.

347
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,950
It's time for dinner. Are you hungry?

348
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,370
Let me take you to our canteen.

349
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,200
You came here in person, Mr. Xu.

350
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
I should have welcomed you.

351
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,900
My bad.

352
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,350
I'm really sorry about that.

353
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,210
You must give me a chance

354
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,360
to make it up to you.

355
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,130
Ms. Jiang.

356
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,700
Not many people had dinner here tonight.

357
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,510
Do you think I should cook less food tomorrow?

358
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,200
No.

359
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,990
I hope they can enjoy their last meals

360
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,200
in Teng Yue.

361
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,830
This bowl of braised pork is for Mr. Xu over there.

362
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,280
He used to order this dish

363
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,470
at C Club a lot.

364
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,630
Thank you, Chef Lin.

365
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,590
Thank you.

366
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,640
It's finally your treat,

367
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,290
despite the fact that it's just a staff meal.

368
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,940
I do want to treat you

369
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,450
to a fancy dinner at the club,

370
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,410
but the budget doesn't permit.

371
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,580
Forgive me for my manners.

372
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,500
Please enjoy this braised pork.

373
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,440
How do you know

374
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,750
I like braised pork?

375
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,830
Because I'm a fortuneteller.

376
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,130
I know

377
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,960
you poached Chef Lin from C Club

378
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,470
to cook staff meals here.

379
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,070
His Shanghai cuisine

380
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,950
is very famous in the circle.

381
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
His salary is quite high.

382
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,090
It is,

383
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,930
but it's cost-effective.

384
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,790
The workers' monthly food cost

385
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,510
is 500 yuan per capita.

386
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,190
Three meals a day with late-night snacks.

387
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,720
To save costs,

388
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,310
the meals used to be more rice and soup than meat and vegetables.

389
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,850
The workers didn't eat well.

390
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Chef Lin has his own

391
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,350
supply channels.

392
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,040
With him taking over my canteen,

393
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,550
I can provide the workers

394
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,500
with better meals

395
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,430
at the same cost as before.

396
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:52,990
How great is that?

397
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,020
I heard that

398
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,230
he also contracted with

399
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,470
several factory canteens nearby.

400
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,390
We should

401
00:16:59,390 --> 00:16:59,910
substitute good resources

402
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,190
for talents,

403
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,710
right?

404
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,510
Jiang Hu.

405
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,420
You are indeed a person

406
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,990
who can achieve more than satisfactory results in work

407
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,410
as long as you put your heart into it.

408
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,869
What's wrong?

409
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,349
My dad used to say the same thing.

410
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,190
I'm sorry.

411
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,160
It's okay.

412
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,280
Let's eat. Is it delicious?

413
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,480
Similar to the quality of C Club.

414
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,110
Hello, Mr. Xu. Hello, Ms. Jiang.

415
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,230
Hello, Mr. Xu. Hello, Ms. Jiang.

416
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,790
You've worked so hard. Go have dinner.

417
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,240
Okay.

418
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,750
You included the introduction of me

419
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,990
in your staff training?

420
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,920
Of course.

421
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,110
If the employees know

422
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,680
what capable shareholders our company has,

423
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,550
they'll be more confident

424
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,630
in work.

425
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,320
What about you?

426
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,590
I...

427
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,190
Although I didn't

428
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,610
want you

429
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,600
to be my shareholder before,

430
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,480
now

431
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,990
I think

432
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,480
having you as a shareholder

433
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,630
makes me quite confident.

434
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,610
Your flattery

435
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,120
is not sincere at all.

436
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,230
Since you asked me that,

437
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,230
you meant to let me

438
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,420
flatter you, right?

439
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,430
I couldn't think of

440
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,270
a fancier compliment

441
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,270
at that moment.

442
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,350
But

443
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,430
I did mean that.

444
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,320
Let's eat.

445
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,230
Okay, Boss.

446
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,610
Show me around the workshop after dinner.

447
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,570
Okay, Boss.

448
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,690
All right, we've made it back.

449
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,970
You should go back.

450
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,170
I'll walk you upstairs. Come on.

451
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm really okay.

452
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,230
This...

453
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,760
Master Zhang.

454
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,130
You...

455
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,380
Ms. Jiang. Mr. Xu.

456
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,150
Here's the thing.

457
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,230
There's one last process

458
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,990
for this batch of orders

459
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,630
that hasn't been finished yet.

460
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,850
I gathered some old staff

461
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,640
to work overtime.

462
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,200
We want to accelerate the process as much as possible.

463
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,370
Don't worry.

464
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,850
This batch of goods will be delivered on time.

465
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,230
Don't worry.

466
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,660
Although we are older,

467
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,290
we work as well as young people.

468
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,340
You can count on us for production

469
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,600
in the future.

470
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,030
Ms. Jiang.

471
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,840
In your most difficult time,

472
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,190
you didn't underpay us.

473
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,900
Food and accommodation have always been good.

474
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
We won't leave.

475
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,990
Yes, we won't leave.

476
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,100
All right, I'll leave you to it.

477
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,320
Rest early after you're done.

478
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,100
Okay.

479
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,590
Thank you.

480
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,260
All right, let's start. Hurry up.

481
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,290
-Hurry up. 
-Okay.

482
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,390
Here.

483
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,660
Not bad.

484
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,160
You managed to hold your tears back

485
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,110
in front of so many workers.

486
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,270
You're a decent boss.

487
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,350
Go back now.

488
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,560
Is it okay if I leave you alone?

489
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,290
I'm not alone.

490
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,020
There are so many people in the factory.

491
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,160
You should go back.

492
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,700
Go.

493
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,090
Hurry up. Go back.

494
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm really okay.

495
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,380
I'm leaving then.

496
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,040
Bye.

497
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:14,170
[Reminder: Props for shooting. Do not imitate.]

498
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,020
I know.

499
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,350
You are the boss here.

500
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,200
You don't have to move. I'll move.

501
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,280
Don't move.

502
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,040
I'll be slow.

503
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,410
Don't move.

504
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,370
Be good.

505
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,580
Don't move.

506
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,890
Okay, sit still.

507
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,100
I'll move.

508
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,960
She's in there. We're almost there.

509
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,680
Sir.

510
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,800
Is it here?

511
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,150
[Teng Yue Shoes, No. 127 Jianghuai Road, Weidong District, Shanghai]

512
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,230
Yes, it is.

513
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,230
Is there someone named

514
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,440
Huang Xiaolin here?

515
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,270
Yes.

516
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,080
Am I right?

517
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,140
Master Zhang.

518
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,390
Look.

519
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,370
Our workshop has the most people leaving.

520
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,910
There are only these few people left.

521
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,180
The problem can't be solved

522
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,870
just by staying up

523
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,760
or working overtime for a few days.

524
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,390
We simply can't make it in time.

525
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,370
Just keep working.

526
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,650
Tell everyone

527
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,510
not to slack off

528
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,140
at their work.

529
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,760
I'll think of a way to get more manpower.

530
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,390
Okay?

531
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,180
We stay up late and work overtime every day

532
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,390
with no subsidies.

533
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,170
What should we do?

534
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Listen to me.

535
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,290
This is the current situation of

536
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,080
our factory.

537
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,580
Don't worry.

538
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,740
Things will get better eventually.

539
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,440
All right, get back to work.

540
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,710
Work.

541
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,570
Work.

542
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,510
Hello, Jun.

543
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,690
Just offer me

544
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,840
300 yuan more.

545
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,870
It's not that much.

546
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,550
I'm trying to get that for you, okay?

547
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,590
You have to come first

548
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,490
before I can talk to them about this.

549
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,620
Does your word count?

550
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,050
Of course.

551
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,670
Trust me. You won't regret it.

552
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,560
The salary here

553
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,540
is already 100 yuan higher

554
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,320
than your salary in Teng Yue.

555
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,380
With your skills,

556
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,760
you can definitely get a raise of 300 yuan.

557
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,840
Come here as soon as possible.

558
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,650
Fine.

559
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,900
I'll trust you for once.

560
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,620
You're really here. Come back with me.

561
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,060
Who are you?

562
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,160
Go away. Mind your own business.

563
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,530
What are you doing?

564
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
If any of you dare to touch my workers

565
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,150
in my factory,

566
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,060
I'll call the police.

567
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,580
What are you doing?

568
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,070
Huang Xiaolin.

569
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,350
She only stayed with us for less than half a year

570
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,770
after getting married before she ran away.

571
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,010
If it weren't my fellow villager

572
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,400
who ran into her working here,

573
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,140
how should I seek justice?

574
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,340
Exactly. Come home with me.

575
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,010
You want to call the police?

576
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,120
Are you trying to scare me?

577
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,300
I'm more than willing to go to the police.

578
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,400
Let the police be the judge.

579
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,040
Huang Xiaolin and my son

580
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,900
are legally married.

581
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,630
She failed to fulfill her duty as a wife

582
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,820
and abandoned her husband.

583
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,020
Is that reasonable?

584
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,310
You be the judge.

585
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,110
Okay?

586
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,950
Seriously.

587
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,770
Huang Xiaolin.

588
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,210
What happened exactly?

589
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,220
When I was 20,

590
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,260
my mother asked their family

591
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,740
for betrothal gifts that are worth 200,000 yuan

592
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,400
and forced me to get married with him.

593
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,690
I didn't want to go.

594
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,640
They tied me up and forced me to go.

595
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,170
Nonsense!

596
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,800
How is that nonsense?

597
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,150
Tell me.

598
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,600
How did you treat me

599
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,100
during my stay at your house for half a year?

600
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,540
You were always worried that I'd run away.

601
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,880
Listen.

602
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,670
I've told my mom.

603
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,780
I'll definitely return

604
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,520
the 200,000-yuan betrothal gifts to you.

605
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,460
I've saved 50,000 yuan

606
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,620
over the past 3 years.

607
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,750
I beg you.

608
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,910
Please let me go.

609
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,740
No manches.

610
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,340
Your mom has used the 200,000 yuan

611
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,760
to build a house for your younger brother.

612
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,600
You want me to wait for you to pay me back?

613
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,110
How long will that be? An eternity?

614
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,270
Alright.

615
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,730
Cut it out.

616
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,240
Don't make a scene, okay?

617
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,180
Ms. Jiang.

618
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,880
Even upright officials find it hard to settle family quarrels.

619
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,280
We aren't able to settle it.

620
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,350
Exactly.

621
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,080
Let's stay out of this.

622
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,610
Who is this?

623
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,150
Okay, don't make a scene. Let's have a talk.

624
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,150
Let's talk it out, okay?

625
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,060
Even if you make a scene here...

626
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,290
No, that won't do.

627
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,720
You either pay me back right now,

628
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,470
or go home with me.

629
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,990
Please let me go.

630
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,990
I'll definitely pay you back.

631
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,630
I have to get something back, right?

632
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,910
I'm begging you.

633
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,240
Okay?

634
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,790
Sis, don't be sad.

635
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Didn't we decide

636
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,380
to leave today?

637
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,010
Let's leave together

638
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,120
after packing.

639
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,540
When we get to the new factory,

640
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,960
no one will know us.

641
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
They won't be able to find you.

642
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,160
Yes.

643
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,260
When we get there, no one will know us.

644
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,660
Yes, let's go together.

645
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,170
We'll go with you.

646
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,290
It's okay.

647
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,010
Where is Ms. Jiang?

648
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,760
Ms. Jiang is having a meeting

649
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,950
on the second floor with Ms. Yue.

650
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,270
I've settled Huang Xiaolin's family

651
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,800
in the meeting room.

652
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,650
Ms. Yue.

653
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,720
What do you think about

654
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,560
Huang Xiaolin's matter?

655
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,810
This is the employee's private business.

656
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,320
It's not under the management of the company.

657
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,070
Besides, her matter is quite complicated.

658
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,900
We'd better stay out of it.

659
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,560
Huang Xiaolin

660
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,400
was recruited by Liu Jun.

661
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,110
Her needlework is very good.

662
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,480
She's one of the best female workers

663
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,400
in our factory.

664
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,160
Besides, she's quite respected

665
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,700
by the workers.

666
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,470
Still, that doesn't mean

667
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,980
we can't find a better one, right?

668
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,420
Zhang Sheng discussed her matter

669
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,280
with me.

670
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,390
She seems to

671
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,810
place a high value on salary.

672
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,630
When our factory

673
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,030
had no orders back then,

674
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,230
I ran into her

675
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,150
delivering takeout.

676
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,630
I think the reason why she didn't

677
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,930
leave with Liu Jun

678
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,440
is that she's comparing

679
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,930
our salary with

680
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,850
the offers of other factories.

681
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,550
I personally think

682
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,720
this employee

683
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,930
is too unstable.

684
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,680
Ms. Yue.

685
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,620
The reason why

686
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
Huang Xiaolin places such high value on salary

687
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,270
is that she wants

688
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,810
to save up to 200,000 yuan sooner

689
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,770
and free herself from the marriage.

690
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,120
That should be the case.

691
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,220
I remember when I was little,

692
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,340
I used to come to the factory a lot.

693
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,350
But I haven't come as much

694
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,550
since I grew up.

695
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,910
Because the older I get,

696
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,180
the more I know.

697
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,510
For me,

698
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,190
an underlying manufacturing industry like this

699
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,450
became less and less attractive.

700
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
At that time,

701
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,060
I always hoped

702
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,760
Free Unicorn could be more advanced

703
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,900
and get rid of these factories.

704
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,030
But now,

705
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,960
I don't think so anymore.

706
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,000
What do you think now?

707
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,900
I finally understand

708
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,440
the meaning

709
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,390
of the existence of factories.

710
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,550
Without

711
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,780
these traditional manufacturing industries,

712
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,200
how can girls with such background

713
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,510
as Huang Xiaolin

714
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,820
have the chance

715
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,790
to walk out of the mountain

716
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,700
and change their fate?

717
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,360
So you're thinking...

718
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,440
Since she managed to get out,

719
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,270
I can't let her go back.

720
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,390
In a lifetime,

721
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,430
there are only few chances

722
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,340
to change our fate.

723
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,780
I can't deprive

724
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,540
her of this chance.

725
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,940
Ms. Jiang,

726
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,430
Thank you.

727
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,410
Xiaolin.

728
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,020
Thank you.

729
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,830
Have some water.

730
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,980
No.

731
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,700
I don't want water.

732
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,510
Hand Huang Xiaolin over to me.

733
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,380
Listen to me. Calm down.

734
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,620
The leaders are having a meeting

735
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,630
to solve

736
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,230
your problem,

737
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,690
right?

738
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,680
What problem?

739
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,340
I want her.

740
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:39,880
No.

741
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,590
Let me ask you.

742
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,270
Can I take

743
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,110
Huang Xiaolin away with me today or what?

744
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,810
No problem.

745
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,390
They're having a meeting to solve this problem...

746
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,400
How? How will you solve it?

747
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,990
Tell me.

748
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,030
It'll be solved very soon.

749
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,190
Stop talking nonsense like this.

750
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,870
I'll sue your factory

751
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,910
for destroying our family.

752
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,390
Where is she?

753
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,260
Listen to me.

754
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,370
This is a company,

755
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,670
not a market.

756
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,880
Don't make a scene.

757
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,740
Let's just wait here.

758
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,980
For how long?

759
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,520
I want her.

760
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,160
Huang Xiaolin! Huang Xiaolin!

761
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,250
Huang Xiaolin!

762
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,230
Huang Xiaolin is here.

763
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,070
It will be solved.

764
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,610
Just wait, okay?

765
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,250
Come back with me today.

766
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,250
I'm telling you.

767
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,420
I'm not leaving.

768
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,030
I'm not going anywhere.

769
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,710
Stop!

770
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,020
Don't fight.

771
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,690
Stop arguing.

772
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,040
Let me introduce.

773
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,510
This is

774
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,680
Lawyer Qin

775
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,340
from Zongheng Law Firm.

776
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,680
Entrusted by Huang Xiaolin,

777
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,290
from now on,

778
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,370
he'll fully represent her in her divorce case.

779
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,670
I want

780
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,990
to communicate with

781
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,850
Huang Xiaolin's husband's family

782
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,520
about Huang Xiaolin's injury assessment report

783
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,200
from three years ago,

784
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,120
and

785
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,350
the following

786
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,010
prosecution process.

787
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,540
Where did you

788
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,470
get this injury assessment report?

789
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,670
She wasn't injured.

790
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,170
What injury assessment?

791
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,670
Why did she leave?

792
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,570
If you have any questions,

793
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,160
Lawyer Qin will answer them for you.

794
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,580
You can use the meeting room.

795
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,560
If you need help,

796
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,860
the workers of our factory

797
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:21,800
will come help you.

798
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,230
Wait for it.

799
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,940
Close the door.

800
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,810
Let's sit down

801
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,270
and have a talk.

802
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Don't go.

803
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,220
I've promised them.

804
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,910
Zhang, stop packing.

805
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,210
It's been so many years.

806
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,230
Can't you stay a little longer?

807
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,360
We're off.

808
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:43,820
No.

809
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,040
Don't go, Sis.

810
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,150
Hurry up. The car is waiting outside.

811
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,070
We've been working here

812
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,990
for so many years.

813
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,500
It's not bad here in Teng Yue.

814
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,550
Hey.

815
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,430
Let's stay longer.

816
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,310
Things will get better, Sis.

817
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,650
Can't you...

818
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,370
Why are you all leaving?

819
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,320
Don't leave.

820
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,240
Can't you wait a little longer?

821
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,120
Don't you have feelings?

822
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,650
Sis, please don't leave.

823
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,240
Let's wait longer.

824
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,620
What are you doing?

825
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,720
Are you leaving?

826
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,000
Please.

827
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,360
Come in.

828
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:16,929
Come in.

829
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,480
Find your workstation

830
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,310
according to the number you drew before

831
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,820
in rows.

832
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,440
From now on,

833
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,690
you'll be working here.

834
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,500
Have you all found your stations?

835
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,210
Any questions?

836
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,020
No.

837
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,660
Good.

838
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,390
Now, please welcome

839
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,980
Ms. Jiang from Teng Yue

840
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,290
to say a few words.

841
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,110
All the old staff of Teng Yue,

842
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,380
you've worked so hard

843
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,430
for the last couple of days.

844
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:38,990
I want

845
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,210
to be honest with you.

846
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,370
You've all served Teng Yue

847
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,360
for a longer time than me.

848
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,790
In the most difficult time

849
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,150
for me and Teng Yue,

850
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,310
you didn't leave.

851
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,360
Here,

852
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,050
I want to say

853
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,670
thank you to all of you.

854
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,990
Thank you.

855
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,180
Thank you.

856
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,210
It's our pleasure.

857
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,400
We've worked here for so long,

858
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,300
right?

859
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:18,760
Yes.

860
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,370
Do you want to thank me, Niece?

861
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,440
Thank you, Uncle.

862
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,290
Today,

863
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,870
we'll also welcome

864
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,200
some new friends

865
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,540
to join

866
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,740
our big family of Teng Yue.

867
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,870
From now on,

868
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,660
let's work together

869
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,480
to make Teng Yue

870
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,300
a better company,

871
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,430
okay?

872
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,540
Okay!

873
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,220
Right.

874
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,190
Let's make Teng Yue

875
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,070
better and better, okay?

876
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,150
Okay!

877
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,270
Let's work hard together, okay?

878
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,430
Okay! Come on!

879
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,830
From now on,

880
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,100
there will be some new rules in the factory.

881
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,860
Ms. Yue will tell you about it.

882
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,860
I'm happy to announce that

883
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,050
all Teng Yue's employees

884
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,830
will all get an extra seniority wage.

885
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,260
This wage will be rated by position

886
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,470
and increase year by year.

887
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Great!

888
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,950
Great!

889
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,580
So the more work we do,

890
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,700
the more we earn, right?

891
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:32,520
Yes.

892
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,710
You won't settle our fines at the end of the year

893
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,750
or deduct our year-end bonuses, right?

894
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
Listen up, everyone.

895
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,500
No penalty, no deduction.

896
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,790
Great!

897
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,050
What about the bonus?

898
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,570
How will the bonus be paid?

899
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,830
Their salary will be paid

900
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,560
on a piecework basis upon base salary.

901
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,390
The more a worker produces,

902
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,430
the more he or she earns.

903
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,830
Penalties for production violations

904
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,870
will be calculated in the current month

905
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,530
and will not be included in the annual settlement.

906
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,350
The bonus is assessed monthly

907
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,150
and divided into quarterly and annual bonuses,

908
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,790
which will be settled separately

909
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,340
and distributed five times a year.

910
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,160
In this way,

911
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,880
the workers in the factory will be stabilized,

912
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,650
and the turnover will be under control.

913
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,350
Ms. Jiang

914
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,470
is really something.

915
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,530
How could Liu Jun and Pei Zhiyuan

916
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,130
ever think of this?

917
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,900
What do you mean?

918
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,770
Boss.

919
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,580
You mean

920
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,240
the 20 people

921
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,760
Pei Zhiyuan brought back

922
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,140
were also part of Ms. Jiang's plan?

923
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,060
She pretended to be at odds with Pei Zhiyuan

924
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,790
in front of Liu Jun,

925
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,690
which made Liu Jun give himself away

926
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,640
and take all his henchmen away

927
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,520
at once.

928
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,120
This way, she cleared up those people justifiably.

929
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,170
She didn't even have to fire them herself.

930
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,560
She didn't have to compensate them

931
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,310
for a month's salary.

932
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,680
Boss, after you analyzed it for me,

933
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,370
I understand it now.

934
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,160
Before Liu Jun took the lead to resign,

935
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,870
there were over 100 workers

936
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,960
in the factory.

937
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,590
He took more than 40 workers away with him,

938
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,930
and Pei Zhiyuan brought back

939
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,660
over 20 people.

940
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,270
Although the total number of workers decreased,

941
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,910
their manpower,

942
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,190
salary and cost

943
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,070
haven't changed.

944
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,480
That means...

945
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,460
That means

946
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,310
under the current condition

947
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,790
of manpower and cost,

948
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,990
she managed to improve work efficiency

949
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,950
and encourage them to get more pay for more work.

950
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,770
I see.

951
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,350
Coordinating one stratagem with another, right?

952
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,030
Boss, listen.

953
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,830
Ms. Jiang

954
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,430
is quite difficult to deal with.

955
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,190
As she should be.

956
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,010
If you want to stand firm in the market,

957
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,410
you have to

958
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,550
become difficult to deal with.

959
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,390
Look.

960
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,380
You should keep more allowance here.

961
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,050
Jun.

962
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm sorry.

963
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,550
I'm calling

964
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,840
to tell you that

965
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,350
I'm not going.

966
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,470
What?

967
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,190
I've got you the salary you want.

968
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,130
4,000 yuan a month.

969
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,510
If you don't come, your place will be taken.

970
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,040
But

971
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,740
Ms. Jiang is quite nice to us.

972
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,330
Also, the factory just announced

973
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,160
the system of piecework-based bonus

974
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,750
and seniority wage.

975
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,540
What?

976
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,820
Seniority wage? How could you buy it?

977
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,880
You can't even finish your job.

978
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,550
Thinking about bonus.

979
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,960
Dream on.

980
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,220
If you can't deliver the goods on time,

981
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,300
Teng Yue will lose money.

982
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,250
You know that, right?

983
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,550
You know what?

984
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,350
Mr. Pei brought

985
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,970
many new employees here just now.

986
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,610
There are enough people on the production line.

987
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,370
What?

988
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:21,840
Alright, Jun.

989
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,740
I have to go.

990
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,040
I need to get back to work.

991
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,480
Way to go, Jiang Hu.

992
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,400
Way to go, Pei Zhiyuan.

993
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,190
You plotted together

994
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
to set me up.

995
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,640
My dear uncle.

996
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,800
Thank you for your hard work.

997
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,530
Here, have some tea.

998
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,650
Thank me again.

999
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,770
Please accept my kowtow, Uncle.

1000
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,920
Alright. Rise.

1001
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,540
Enough.

1002
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,010
Well,

1003
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,820
the show we put on is worth it.

1004
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,350
You're the Best Actor.

1005
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,230
Listen, seriously.

1006
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,890
The Best Actor. For real.

1007
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,880
You're welcome.

1008
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,390
Can you stop

1009
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,620
flattering each other?

1010
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,020
You two are really something.

1011
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,960
You plotted it together.

1012
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,070
I only figured it out just now.

1013
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,630
How long did you plan to hide it from me?

1014
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,080
No.

1015
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,980
This...

1016
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,140
This is all Jiang Hu's idea.

1017
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,260
She said before we make it,

1018
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,350
well,

1019
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,250
we shouldn't tell anyone.

1020
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,830
Ms. Yue.

1021
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,830
Actually, I was also uncertain

1022
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,020
about Liu Jun.

1023
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,950
So I didn't dare to tell you in advance.

1024
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,390
So do you know your victory today

1025
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,020
came with great risks?

1026
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,950
If anything had gone wrong

1027
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,750
in the process,

1028
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,150
the entire production would have been ruined.

1029
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,080
You...

1030
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,640
From this incident,

1031
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,790
have you noticed that

1032
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,640
this girl

1033
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,400
is getting more and more interested in gambling,

1034
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,430
has many ideas,

1035
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,930
and is good at business?

1036
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,660
She's just like her father.

1037
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,330
Some of it was inherited from you.

1038
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,630
That's because she believed she could win.

1039
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,170
But I did win.

1040
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,380
Alright.

1041
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,290
I've brought the employees back for you.

1042
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,730
What should we do next?

1043
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,330
You can't just use

1044
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
those colored shoelaces

1045
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,720
as a gimmick.

1046
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,300
That's not the right thing to do.

1047
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,040
I know.

1048
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,650
How about this?

1049
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,950
I'll make another trip

1050
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,010
to the influencers' livestreaming base

1051
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,740
and see if there's any suitable host

1052
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,480
that we can cooperate with.

1053
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,640
This isn't a long-term solution either.

1054
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,150
The most important thing for now

1055
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,640
is to make up our mind on the designer as soon as possible.
