you want to say to us?

But now the market is...

16

If we can

17
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,390
continuously develop new styles,

21
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,390
I believe

22
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,070
Cloud Footwear can make it past 100 years.

Wait, you...

24
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,980

25
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,110
here tonight

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,150

27
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,020
Can we

28
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,970
develop in this direction?

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
Director, look.

30
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,150
You...

31
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,230
You're right on the point.

32
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,829
Director.

33
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,590
We should have started

34
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,800
developing in this direction long ago.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,070
Yes.

36
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,670
I don't believe

37
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,870
we can't compete with international brands.

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,430
Exactly.

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,110
Look, he took us around the factory

40
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,230
for half an hour,

41
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,230
and this is what he wanted to say.

42
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,550
Okay. Good.

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,510
Since we're of the same mind,

44
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,780
let's work in unity.

45
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,510
Director, no problem.

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,510
Rest assured, Director.

47

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,110
you asked Ms. Zhang

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,829
to transfer to my pay card?

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,990
It's your sales commission.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,150
It can't be helped even if you think it's too little.

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,829
That's all I can give you.

55
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,270
I don't want it.

56
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,020
I'll transfer it to back to you right now.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,700
Hey.

58
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,960
So there really are people in this world

59
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,590
who don’t like money.

60
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,790
You don't want it even if I gave it to you?

61
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,350
I said I don't want it, so say no more.

62
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,700
Give it to whoever you want.

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
If you can't accept it,

64
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,350
just take it as the compensation

65
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,560
for the patent infringement

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,550
my dad committed.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,820
Stop.

68
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,710
Jiang Qisheng owed me too much.

69
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,390

Sit down.

83

If you want to pay off

84
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,550
all the debts your dad owed me,

85
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,070
sit tight in this very position.

86
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,550
From now on,

87
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,460
Cloud Footwear will be handed over to you.

88
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,880
I couldn't do that.

89
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,990
You said it yourself.

90
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,030
I'm old, my ideas are no longer up to date,

91
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,920

I can't run the factory.

94
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,470
Then it's your fault for not making it clear back then.

95
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,280
It's too late to say it now.

96
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,680
I've told all the staff

97
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,960
in the factory about it.

98
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,380

111
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,990

When I was in Teng Yue,

124
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,910

126
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,390

127
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,220
did I realize that

128
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,590

383
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,030
Let's go.

384
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,330
You've got the inspiration?

385
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,630
The 100-year anniversary series'

386
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,150
rudiment is right here.

387
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,470
Do you want to challenge

388
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,270
a more difficult task?

389
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,250
What crazy idea did you come up with this time?

390
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,070
Teng Yue and Cloud Footwear's

391
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,830
100-year anniversary brand collaboration series.

392
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,630
No problem.

393
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,140
It's up to how much more design fee you're offering.

394
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,600
Who said

395
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,050
she'd hold on to Teng Yue for me,

396
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,780
and she owes a lot

397
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,580
to Teng Yue and me?

398
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,000
It's only been a few days,

399
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,950
and you started asking me for a raise.

400
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,460
It will hurt our relationship.

401
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,390
As someone who's experienced similar things,

402
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,370
I'm telling you, only when the accounts are clear

403
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,580
can a friendship last long.

404
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,570
Get in. It's freezing.

405
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,320
Thanks.

406
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,380
This time we're using Gary's fund

407
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,640
as our limited partner.

408
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,780
He didn't take this chance

409
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,440
to introduce another girl to you, did he?

410
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,860
I told him I have a son.

411
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,090
You know what? Your son

412
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,150
eats and sleeps very well,

413
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,690
and he goes to school every day.

414
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,390
You really need to work hard to make money.

415
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:28,990
Otherwise,

416
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,710
you wouldn't be able to support this bill crusher.

417
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,070
I'm trying, okay?

418
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,330
Seriously, though.

419
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,240
Jiang Hu

420
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,550
suddenly returned to Teng Yue,

421
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,110
and she's in charge of management now.

422
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,710
But she still

423
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,670
hasn't signed that contract.

424
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,560
Your aunt still has

425
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,720
that Equity Gifting Agreement.

426
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,870
So the entire Teng Yue

427
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,290
is still under your name.

428
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,570
Where are we going now?

429
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,120
To pick up my son.

430
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,620
I'm afraid if Fei raises

431
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,409
Kid for a few more days,

432
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,730
I won't be able to get it back.

433
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,110
No problem.

434
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:32,980
The sales of Cloud Footwear's online store

435
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,790
increased

436
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,949
by 30% this quarter.

437
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,350
Zhaoyang's design for

438
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,730
the two brands' 100-year anniversary collaboration

439
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,710
was very popular.

440
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,190
The 100,000 pairs we reserved

441
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,949
have been sold out.

442
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,610
You're so capable.

443
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,340
No wonder Yang

444
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,610
left all the work to you

445
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,989
and became an absentee landlord himself.

446
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,389
He...

447
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,270
He has more tricky problems to deal with.

448
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,659
What problem?

449
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,630
Blind date.

450
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,310
Xiang Zhaoyang finally

451
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,310
dumped him?

452
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,490
Great.

453
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,830
Without Yang Jian

454
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,880
all over her

455
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,590
all the time,

456
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,150
she can finally

457
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,500
focus on designing.

458
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,150
You wish.

459
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,600
He's here.

460
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,520
I walked here.

461
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,610
Really?

462
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,200
You live nearby?

463
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,280
Take a look.

464
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,430
This...

465
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,510
Check out this design.

466
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,160
So stylish.

467
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,790
Look.

468
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,790
How thick

469
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,030
this pillar is.

470
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,760
It represents Teng Yue's strength.

471
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,470
Teng Yue.

472
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,670
Look.

473
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,190
This place

474
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,270
is really nice.

475
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,700
Of course.

476
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,490
Don't you know whose workshop this is?

477
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,350
It's Teng Yue's.

478
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,110
Teng Yue.

479
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,230
Well,

480
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:34,990
Jiang Hu.

481
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,790
When is Cloud Footwear moving here?

482
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,640
Why does

483
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,260
Cloud Footwear have to

484
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,130
follow Teng Yue wherever we go?

485
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,350
You copycat.

486
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,330
That's not true.

487
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,710
What do you mean

488
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,750
Cloud Footwear follows Teng Yue wherever you go?

489
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,630
It's more like

490
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,820
Cloud Footwear should be

491
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,180
wherever Jiang Hu is.

492
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,080
You're being one-sided.

493
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,730
It's more like Teng Yue belongs to Jiang Hu,

494
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,780
and Jiang Hu belongs to Teng Yue.

495
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,400
Right?

496
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,050
Jiang Hu.

497
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,150
Well,

498
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,920
Cloud Footwear has to move here.

499
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,590
The decoration has already started.

500
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,640
By the way,

501
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,870
when Cloud Footwear moves here,

502
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,130
it'll be next to Teng Yue.

503
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,650
You can't

504
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,140
treat them differently.

505
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,840
I wouldn't have thought of this

506
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,910
if you didn't mention it.

507
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,100
Since you mentioned it, it occurred to me that

508
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,470
Li from Micro Dance Club

509
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,590
paid 3 million back.

510
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,210
Jiang Hu

511
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,960
didn't invest a penny of that money

512
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,780
into Teng Yue.

513
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,680
She invested it all in Cloud Footwear.

514
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,470
Jiang Hu.

515
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,550
Jiang Hu.

516
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,030
You...

517
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,100
Jiang Hu, you're favoring

518
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,840
the outsider too much.

519
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,430
You've started showing partiality to them already.

520
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,030
Uncle. Uncle.

521
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,530
Enough.

522
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,870
In my heart,

523
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,720
Teng Yue and Cloud Footwear

524
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,060
are equally important.

525
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,710
Good.

526
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,000
You see what having a big heart is like?

527
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,990
♫You say the wind picks up♫

528
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,000

♫Your bright face♫

00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,970
♫I have to keep writing♫

572
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,990
Go ahead.

573
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,120
♫Slowly, affectionately, and quietly♫

574
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,330
Is Teng Yue

575
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,870
♫Writing♫

576
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,240
the incomparable existence in your heart?

577
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,390
♫You said in this world♫

578
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,280
Yes.

579
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,990
♫There are cloudy days and sunny days♫

580
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,870
If it weren't for Teng Yue,

581
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,370
♫Your bright face♫

582
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,310
♫Is like a sun but it's fading away♫

583
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,420
you wouldn't have fallen in love with me, right?

584
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:11,700
Yes.

585
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,730
♫Waving goodbye♫

586
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,260
♫It's not just a period of time that I say goodbye to♫

587
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,170
If you have to choose

588
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,720
♫But also my youth♫

589
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,380
between Teng Yue and me,

590
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,600
what would be your choice?

591
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,530
You.

592
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,690
♫The world and I♫

593
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,580
♫Reconcile and fall in love at the moment♫

594
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,680
♫Because I'm using my fingers♫

595
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:39,590
♫To chase the wind and your smile♫

596
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,440
♫When the wind reveals what I miss♫

597
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,490
♫When I realize this is love♫

598
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,920
♫You're already gone♫

599
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:38,410
[Rising With the Wind]

600
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:38,410
[Running against the wind. Beginning with Jiang Hu. When rising with the wind, Zhaoyang will be there for you.]
