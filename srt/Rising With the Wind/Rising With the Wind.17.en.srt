Thank you, everyone.

Thank you.

Zhaoyang.

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,550
We've filmed

11
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,210
five videos of you drawing on the shoes.

12
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,160
I think the material

13
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,550
may be a little repetitive.

14
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,230
Well,

15
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,950
I booked the

Let's film there next time?

18
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,010
Sure.

19
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,160
I have to say, you look really comfortable

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,550
I'm sure it'll be wonderful after editing.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,760
Of course.

23
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,190
Zhaoyang is a professional

24
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,490

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,430

32
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,270
we have to trouble you

33
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,410
to cook for us.

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
We're embarrassed.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,390
It's okay, it's what I should do.

Zhaoyang, your brother is so nice.

41
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,320
How is it?

42
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,620
It's time to eat.

Mr. Gao,

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
The Marketing Department requested

45
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,620
to delay the dismantling of the boards by a week.

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,700

47
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,090
in front of the board.

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,829
Our event

49
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,780

50
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,240
Our brand partners

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,990

52
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,650

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,510
Get the Marketing Department

54
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,690

55
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,270

56
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,550

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,670
We need strong support

58
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,430

59
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,510
Yes.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,250
What are you laughing at?

61
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,220
They all said

62
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,390
that really

63
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,390
looks like you.

64

65
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,350
We'll leave it then.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,070
Yes, leave it.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,670
Clean it up yourself.

68
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,430
It's okay.

69
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,480

hasn't launched yet.

86
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,580

user experience research.

88
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,590

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,720
Okay.

They're not in stores yet.

Hurry up.

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,080
Come on.

163
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,330
We've been waiting for you.

164
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,300
You must be hungry.

165
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,910
Have a seat.

166

Come on.

167
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,760
Perfect.

What would you like to drink?

171
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,010
This is good beer.

Come on.

173
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,960
Hurry up, tell me what you want to talk about.

174
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,100
Come to Tengyue to be a designer.

175
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,180
Do you know what you're talking about?

176
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,230
I saw your collaboration with Lidu.

177
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,730
You drew on a lot of shoes.

178
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,910
You still want to be a designer,

179
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,030
right?

180
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,230
So what?

181
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,700
Instead of stopping

182
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,830
at the design stage,

183
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,900
I can manufacture those shoes.

184
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,710
You want me to let you do it?

185
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,320
Jiang Hu.

186
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,030
You're so full of yourself again.

187
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,470
Firstly,

188
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,480
Teng Yue is no longer

189
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,470
under the protection of Free Unicorn.

190
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,710
Secondly,

191
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,470
you've been fussing around for a while

192
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,310
all you made

193
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,310
was a few colorful shoelaces.

194
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,780
How dare you ask for my designs?

195
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,950

390
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,700
Pour me some liquor.

391
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,030
I want baijiu.

392
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
Okay.

393
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,770
The liquor is ready.

394
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,950
Coming.

395
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,480
Get up. Here comes the baijiu.

396
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,810
Jiang Hu.

397
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,700
Get up and drink.

398
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,020
Get up.

399
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,310
Come.

400
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,190
Here, Jiang Hu.

401
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,190
Why are you grabbing me?

402
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,510
Get up and drink.

403
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,270
Why are you grabbing me?

404
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,040
My hair.

405
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,870
Let go!

406
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,430
Let go!

407
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,030
Why are you biting me?

408
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,570
Let go.

409
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,620
Jiang Hu!

410
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,040
It hurts.

411
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,470
I don't understand.

412
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,710
Others see me

413
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,140
as capable and astute.

414
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,630
How did I become

415
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,060
a scumbag in your eyes?

416
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,860
Don't go off-topic.

417
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,250
Answer my question.

418
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,510
I'm almost at the office.

419
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,310
I have a meeting.

420
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,990
I have to go.

421
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,470
By the way,

422
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,310
are you coming to the office

423
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,950
to do a project presentation today?

424
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,230
Remember to return my tie to me.

425
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,380
Bye.

426
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,270
Indescribable

427
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,710
and unspeakable.

428
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,250
Financial capacity analysis

429
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,580
for investments in the finance industry

430
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,280
mainly includes

431
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,790
the company's

432
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,460
ability to make profit

433
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,560
in the finance industry,

434
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,470
its ability to repay debts

435
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,050
and its operational capabilities.

436
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,680
♫Come back when the sea becomes calm again♫

437
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,130
♫Come back when the swallows crow♫

438
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,610
♫When the flowers on the riverbank bloom♫

439

♫Don't be so honest if you want to leave♫

440

♫You don't have to♫

441
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,410
♫Find excuses to cover it up anymore♫

442
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,130
♫You who are afraid of busy crowds♫

443
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,620
♫You who love to push yourself too hard♫

444
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,260
♫I'm still behind you♫

445
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,400
♫Waiting for you to come back♫

446

♫May all the nice things in the world♫

451

That's basically

452
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,710
what's in the report.

453
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,390
♫Come to you♫

♫I want to become the novelist♫

455

Thomas,

456
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,710
do you have anything to add

457
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
for the industry trends

458
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,730
♫Of your love story♫

459
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,420
that Joe reported on just now?

00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,850
♫I want to♫

461
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,910
Gary came all the way from the UK

462
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,360
♫Write you a poem and a fairy tale♫

463
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,190
to inspect our business.

464
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,630
I'll talk more about the growth of

465
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,950
unicorns in the industry then.

466
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:05,970
Okay.

467
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,150
♫Where the land is criss-crossed♫

468
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,950
♫With green grass and flowers♫

469
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,950
♫The view on the mountain top is as beautiful as you♫

470
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,560
Thank you.

471
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,370
♫I don't know how to describe it♫

472
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,370
♫But it's just like you♫

473
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,140
♫Like you, while you are♫

474
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,940
♫So different and unique♫

475
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,730
Simon.

476
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,550
You're in a good mood today.

477
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,270
That's because you're here.

478
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,680
Cut it out.

479
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,430
Your current state

480
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,390
is totally different from

481
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,230
the last time

482
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,580
when I saw you in the UK.

483
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,550
Really?

484
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,870
Because

485
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,710
Baoxing's performance

486
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,620
has been improving steadily.

487
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,600
We feel like

488
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,580
we didn't let you down.

489
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,770
That's why he's relieved.

490
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,750
When Simon introduced Baoxing

491
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,950
to me,

492
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,470
I worked with you guys

493
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,470
because I trusted him.

494
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,630
Now it seems that Baoxing’s performance

495
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,630
has proved one thing.

496
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,920
That is, Simon and I

497
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,590
both have a good eye.

498
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,730
Okay, that's all for today.

499
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,550
By the way, Simon,

500
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,390
have you been single for a long time?

501
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,670
There's a vice president in our group,

502
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,710
a girl who's very outstanding.

503
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,870
I'll ask her out for you.

504
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,740
Let's have dinner together.

505
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,250
Don't make fun of me.

506
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,280
I'm not joking.

507
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,990
I'm serious.

508
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,540
A man's

509
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,490
career and family are equally important.

510
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,900
I have a girlfriend.

511
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,000
When did that happen?

512
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,990
Which girl

513
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,550
can subdue a fox like you?

514
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,920
Mr. Xu, someone is looking for you.

515
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,810
The one who subdued me is here.

516
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,310
I can't accompany you for lunch.

517
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,240
I seek your understanding.

518
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,490
Sure, sure I understand.

519
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,060
I'll wait for news on your wedding then.

520
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,590
Bye.

521
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,110
Are you and Jiang Hu for real?

522
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,070
When did you

523
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,230
become so gossipy?

524
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,310
Are you just using her as your shield then?

525
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,710
But why did you

526
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,220
refuse Gary's kindness?

527
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,470
This is a good chance

528
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,470
to get closer to him.

529
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,660
You’re really making the most of your talents.

530
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,640
Not only will it be good for Baoxing,

531
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,110
but

532
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,210
for you too.

533
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,950
Gary is famous

534
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,960
for being a matchmaker.

535
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,710
He's introducing someone on his side

536
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
to his business partner.

537
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,920
Do you really think

538
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,290
he's just being warm-hearted?

539
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,200
What else could he be doing?

540
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,960
Don't tell me you're thinking of

541
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,230
sharing Baoxing's financial report

542
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,390
with a limited partner

543
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,230
like Gary

544
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,870
so he can take

545
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,260
more good projects

546
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,750
with joint-investment opportunities from us?

547
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,710
Mr. Du.

548
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,460
Okay.

549
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,580
Go on with your work.

550
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,770
Xu Si, last night...

551
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,470
During working hours, we'll only talk about work.

552
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,900
Take a seat.

553
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,630
We've recruited

554
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,720
all necessary staff for Teng Yue

555
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,150
and all production lines

556
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,610
are back to production.

557
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,750
My next focus will be

558
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,370
on signing designers.

559
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,570
Do you have a candidate?

560
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,960
It's hard to find designers for Teng Yue.

561
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,330
He needs to know Teng Yue's past

562
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,520
and design Teng Yue's future.

563
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,610
He has to get Teng Yue's new products out

564
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,440
as soon as possible

565
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,250
and open up a new market.

566
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,820
The way you said that

567
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,910
makes me sense

568
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,430
another meaning.

569
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,710
I've found

570
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,500
a suitable candidate.

571
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,500
You want to poach someone from me?

572
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,910
You can't say that.

573
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,550
In the human resource market,

574
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,630
it's a fair fight.

575
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,790
Although

576
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,410
we are both financed by Baoxing,

577
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,550
we hope

578
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,580
our efforts

579
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,800
will bring you more satisfactory profits.

580
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,550
From what you said,

581
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,760
it seems like you're doing this for me.

582
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,920
I know

583
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,150
you've never allowed

584
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,150
malicious competition

585
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,000
between all the companies

586
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,990
that Baoxing

587
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,150
has invested in.

588
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,030
So you know

589
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,910
my bottom line.

590
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,470
But I really don't have

591
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,900
a better candidate.

592
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:03,920
Tell me.

593
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,020
Who are you looking at?

594
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,150
Xiang Zhaoyang.

595
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:23,990
Not only is Xiang Zhaoyang

596
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,470
from TT Media,

597
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,870
but she also has a non-compete agreement with Aneda.

598
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,230
She can't be a designer within two years.

599
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,550
You know that right?

600
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,990
I know.

601
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,650
And she has no experience

602
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,310
being an independent designer.

603
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,050
I know that too.

604
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,880
So, what are you plotting?

605
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,390
The problem issue

606
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,200
with TT Media and Aneda

607
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
can be resolved.

608
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,750
It doesn't take away the talent

609
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,510
that Xiang Zhaoyang

610
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,090
has for designing shoes.

611
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,390
And as an influencer,

612
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,090
she also has her own sales channels.

613
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,710
She is more suitable

614
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,550
than other designers for Teng Yue,

615
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,140
which needs to open new markets urgently.

616
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,670
I really admire people

617
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,120
who impose challenges on themselves

618
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,800
even when there're no difficulties.

619
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,010
You're hardcore.

620
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,060
So, what do you think?

621
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,650
I'll think about it.

622
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,110
Anything else?

623
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,500
I'm waiting for your answer.

624
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,900
I didn't say I'll give you an answer now.

625
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,000
You said you'll think about it.

626
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,410
It's just

627
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,960
a polite way to phrase it.

628
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,970
It's like, let's talk about it another day.

629
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,160
Let's talk about it later.

630
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,450
Let's meet again sometime.

631
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,680
It's the same.

632
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,390
Teng Yue wants to poach Zhaoyang?

633
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,120
Well,

634
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,930
what about our

635
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,040
Shangchun Art Project?

636
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,900
Both Dus are paying close attention to it.

637
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,410
They're very interested in this project.

638
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,140
Did I say I would help Teng Yue?

639
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,450
Let TT Media

640
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,930
continue with the Shangchun Art Project.

641
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,680
Are you not going to let her go?

642
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,240
Okay.

643
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,670
At least for now,

644
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,870
influencer Zhaoyang

645
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,310
is more valuable to me than designer Zhaoyang.

646
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,680
Then we're doomed.

647
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,510
Teng Yue's definitely not going to meet

648
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,740
this quarter's targets.

649
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,780
Miss Jiang is bold

650
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,670
and dares to play tricks.

651
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,910
She's full of ideas.

652
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,390
Would she make a loss?

653
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,360
Do you think she should be happy

654
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,030
or sad that you trust her so much?

655
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,790
You're buying lunch.

656
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,880
Okay.

657
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,140
Why are you still here?

658
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,000
We're outside of working hours now.

659
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,070
It's lunch time.

660
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
Can we talk?

661
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,280
Isn't lunch time

662
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,610
meant for resting?

663
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,230
Xu Si.

664
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,140
How about this?

665
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,670
Treat me to a meal,

666
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,000
let's talk while eating.

667
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,170
There's a lot of things

668
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,190
I need to deal with for Teng Yue.

669
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,510
I don't have that much time.

670
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
When I'm hungry,

671
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,440
my memory gets really lousy,

672
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,400
right?

673
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,150
Yes.

674
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,800
He knows it best.

675
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,760
Yes, I do.

676
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,090
I'll choose what to eat.

677
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,520
Okay.

678
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,970
Don't you have work to do?

679
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,070
Go.

680
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,750
Don't you have work?

681
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,880
Weren't you going to buy me lunch?

682
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,390
I'm not following your motto anymore.

683
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,090
Wu Guanglei.

684
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,350
Wu Guanglei.

685
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,780
That means you'll never be fair and square.

686
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,080
I've been exposed.

687
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,980
What are you treating me to?

688
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,850
To this.

689
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,219
You like convenience stores so much?

690
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,120
Well, it's quick.

691
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,190
It's cheap.

692
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,800
And it suits me.

693
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,679
Why are you standing there?

694
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,310
Sit down.

695
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,909
I can't bring myself

696
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,980
to do that.

697
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,840
It's not like you haven't eaten this before.

698
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,800
That was at night.

699
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,790
It's different.

700
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,670
I said you're capitalist,

701
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,470
and now you really think

702
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,480
you're a vampire?

703
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,340
You can eat it at night

704
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,440
but not during the day?

705
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,510
Don't be so self-conscious.

706
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,590
All the passers-by are really busy today.

707
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,710
They won't have time to notice you.

708
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,480
Eat up.

709
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,620
Sit down.

710
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,190
Sit down.

711
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,320
Thank you, boss.

712
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,780
Okay, I'm done.

713
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,880
We can talk now.

714
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,260
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

715
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,680
Yes, I did.

716
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,230
So what?

717
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,990
I haven't seen anyone

718
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,830
who

719
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,870
makes it so obvious.

720
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,690
I said I don't have time.

721
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,950
And you agreed

722
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,790
to eat whatever I want.

723
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,270
What good does it do

724
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,390
for you to offend me,

725
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,920
Jiang Hu?

726
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,500
I do get something.

727
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,780
What?

728
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,780
I get to relieve my anger.

I don't mind.

769
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,950
You don't mind.

770
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,410
If you don't mind,

771
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,100
then why are you hounding me

772
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,220
♫In this deserted corner♫

773
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,680
about what happened last night?

774
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,770
I...

775
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,830
♫Caught lightly by love♫

776
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,000
I just...

777
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,060
Want to explain?

778
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,280
♫Let myself fall into the gentle vortex♫

779
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,940
An explanation is an attempt to cover up.

780
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,290
A cover-up reveals the truth.

781
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,800
Jiang Hu,

782
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,080
♫It's like in your eyes♫

783
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
have you ever wondered

784
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,900
why you care so much?

785
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,920
♫There's also bewilderment♫

786
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,280
♫Every moon falls♫

787
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,400
Think about the real reason.

788
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,590
Give me

789
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,100
♫If you♫

790
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,410
and give yourself

791
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,640
a clear answer.

792
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:32,250
♫Start to wish for a certain kind of chemistry♫

793
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,520
♫Three lines of poem♫

794
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,330
♫Let me sing for you♫

795
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,070
♫You're like the moonlight♫

796
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,800
♫Which flows into my heart♫

797
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,110
♫We stare blankly together♫

798
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,230
♫The stars fall down♫

799
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,790
♫Even the shadows are cute♫

800
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,130
♫You're the moonlight♫

801
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:53,860
It's not bad.

802
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,800
♫Covering everything gently♫

803
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,320
♫No need to say it out loud♫

804
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,000
♫About the blushing♫

805
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,060
♫That night is worth♫

806
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,040
[Town]

807
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,800
♫Expecting♫

808
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,460
There's no need to think about it.

809
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,240
I can give you

810
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,740
an answer now.

811
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,300
Go ahead.

812
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,980
Xiang Zhaoyang

813
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,430
signed a full five-year contract with me.

814
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,310
If you insist on hiring her,

815
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,300
you should know

816
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,040
you'll have to pay

817
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,500
tens of millions in penalty.

818
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,290
Ms. Song, you must be joking.

819
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:35,900
What makes you

820
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,080
think I'm joking?

821
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,510
Tens of millions is indeed too much.

822
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,000
Xiang Zhaoyang is worth that much

823
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,120
in my eyes.

824
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,310
I consulted a lawyer before I came.

825
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,250
I'm confident that

826
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,650
the termination fee will be within one million.

827
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,970
See you in court then.

828
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,270
TT Media is not afraid

829
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,170
of lawsuits.

830
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,060
Otherwise,

831
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,430
why would we keep a legal department

832
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,240
with such high salaries?

833
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,840
They are so bored.

834
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,760
TT Media can't win

835
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,550
this case.

836
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,450
So what?

837
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,810
If the case drags on for one or two years,

838
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,790
it won't do us any harm.

839
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,890
I have a meeting later.

840
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,670
I won't keep you.

841
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,670
You studied at Cambridge too?

842
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,870
Who else studied there?

843
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,440
Mr. Xu.

844
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,830
Alumni investing in alumni.

845
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,350
You must be very close.

846
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,340
He is my ex-boyfriend.

847
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,240
Miss Jiang.

848
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,100
Okay, I’m leaving.

849
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,650
Be careful.

850
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,360
Where should I put it, Ms. Yue?

851
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,990
Let's put it here.

852
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,640
What is this?

853
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,660
Ms. Jiang.

854
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,790
It's from Xu Si.

855
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,120
Where do you want to put it?

856
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,480
Put...

857
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,380
Put it over there.

858
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,750
Put it here.

859
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,370
There's some space here.

860
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:52,980
Okay.

861
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,940
Thank you.
I’ll put it here.

862
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,330
I'll get back to work.

863
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:57,950
Go ahead.
