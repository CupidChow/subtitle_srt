Jindian Industry

has sent people to view the cup factory.

8
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,979
They said they'd have

00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,390
their quotation calculated within this week

10
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,120
and give it to us.

11
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,720
One more thing.

12
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,470
Have you told your mom about this?

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,990
This doesn't concern you.

14
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,790
Okay.

15
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,180
This way.

16
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,990
What a pity.

17
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,120
No, it's not.

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,300
Everything is here.

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,500
Help yourselves.

20
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,210
Gosh, Jiang Hu.

21
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,590
You've only got

22
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,220
these few pairs of shoes left.

23
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,950
Then why are you selling them?

24
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,230
They're not even enough for you to wear.

25
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,310
You are so miserable now.

26
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,660
We feel so bad for you.

27
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,620
Exactly.

28
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,990
This pair it is.

29
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,829
Wrap it up for me.

30
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,390
Is 3,000 enough?

31
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,150
I'll transfer it to you on WeChat.

32
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,310
3000?

33
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,070
3000 isn't

34
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,400
even a fraction of the cost of this pair of shoes.

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Ms. Jiang.

36
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,270
I know the market price better than you.

37
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,410
I won't offer you more money.

38
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,250
If you don't believe me, try sell it on Xianyu yourself.

39
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,620
I want this pair.

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,420
That pair...

41
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,950
I don't feel like selling that pair.

42
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,800
Can you pick something else?

43
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,790
If you don't want to sell,

44
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,950
then why did you ask me here?

45
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,220
Are you messing with me?

46
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,020
No.

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,830
That pair of shoes

48
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,170
was customized for me

49
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,980
by my dad and the designer of Free Unicorn

50
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,210
when I was 18.

51
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,590
That's the only pair in the world.

52
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,160
But this pair is exactly what I want.

53
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,470
I won't bargain with you

54
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,350
like her.

55
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,780
I offer you 10,000 for this pair.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,680
Jiang Hu.

57
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,140
The laces of this pair of shoes are so hard to tie.

58
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,550
Come and show me

59
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,650
how you tie them.

60
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,590
Come tie them for me.

61
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,700
Either

62
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,640
you tie my shoelaces,

63
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,930
or

64
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,520
I won't buy anything.

65
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
They won't, either.

66
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,300
Wang Lan.

67
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,710
We all used to be good friends.

68
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,040
You...

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,880

70
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,030
to slap Wenshan on the auction

71
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,909

Early this morning,

148
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,990
we saw your luggage was here,

149
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,880
but you were not.

150
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,230
I knew you must have come.

151
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,670
We

152
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,200
cleaned up the upstairs room for you.

153
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,630
We also cleaned up

154
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,690
the bathroom for you.

155
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,470
Why don't you go take a look?

156
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:03,950
Okay.

157
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,390

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,010
Please.

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,260
Come here.

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,300
Come here.

161
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:17,830
Check it out.

162
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,590
I'll ask my son

163
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,830
to come install a rain shower this afternoon,

164
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,760
and it'll be fully-equipped.

165
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,300
One more thing.

166
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,030
This is the key to the bathroom.

167
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,120
Here, take it.

168
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,140
This is the only one.

169
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,230
From now on,

170
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,060
this place will be solely yours.

171
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,230
If you need anything in the future,

172
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,190
or if you need help with cleaning,

173
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,310
just let us know.

174
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,070
You're more than welcome.

175
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,890
We don't know

176
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,320
how much longer we can stay.

177
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,030
But as long as we're here,

178
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,790
we'll take good care of you

179
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,590
for your grandpa and your mom.

180
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,610
Yes.

181
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,300
Thank you.

182
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,510
Let's go see upstairs.

183
00:14:59,390 --> 00:14:59,790
Okay.

184
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,710

185
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,510

186
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,280
Look.

187
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,990
Look, the condition is just like this.

188
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,510
Sorry you'll have to cope with it.

189
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,390
Alright.

190
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,430
Take a rest.

191
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,270
We'll get back to work downstairs.

192
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,110
Let me know if you need anything.

193
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,840
Let us know.

194
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,940
We're leaving.

195
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,710
Let's go.

196
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,200
Okay.

197
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,180
See you.

198
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,510
Let's go.

199
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,510
Boss.

200
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,920
Boss, come here.

201
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,440
Come here.

202
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,050
Boss, here.

203
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,720
Come on.

204
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,770
I'll live here with you from now on.

205
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,030
Let's get along.

206
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,490
Auntie, why are you here?

207
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,410
You took people to view the factory?

208
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,910
You know

209
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,350
that factory is your mom's life.

210
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Given my mom's condition,

211
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,030
her life will be at risk

212
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,030
if she keeps on working in the factory.

213
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,380
You know that

214
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,570
she takes money from home every month

215
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,440
to support the factory.

216
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,910
Do you think

217
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,670
she should keep going?

218
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,660
Don't tell me

219
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,650
you don't know why.

220
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,150
Speak of the devil.

221
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,190
Hello, Mom.

222
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,390
Okay. Got it.

223
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,510
Okay.

224
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,660
Moping.

225
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:30,800
Mom.

226
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,790
Stand right there.

227
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,550
Why don't we sit down and talk?

228
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,680
You can come and sit.

229
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,150
Let him stand.

230
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,340
Tell me.

231
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,620
Let me ask you.

232
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,390
Do you know you're wrong?

233
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:48,830
Mom.

234
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:49,870
Do you know

235
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,030
why I studied finance?

236
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,690
Of course we know.

237
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,110
To help enterprises with financial tools.

238
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,570
No.

239
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,470
The purpose of finance

240
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,130
is never

241
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,170
to facilitate the development of enterprises.

242
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,570
This kid...

243
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,840
Let him finish.

244
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,090
The purpose of finance

245
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,130
is to let those inefficient enterprises

246
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,230
clear out and go bankrupt themselves.

247
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,810
I always bear this purpose

248
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,660
in mind

249
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,860
whether when I did mergers and acquisitions before

250
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,570
or work in Baoxing now.

251
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,580
If your dad

252
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,480
knew what you just said...

253
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,950
If my dad knew what I just said,

254
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,650
he would agree with me.

255
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,640
Survival of the fittest.

256
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,330
Let what needs to end end.

257
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,190
In this way,

258
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,270
we can not only avoid tragedies from happening,

259
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,000
but also get a win-win.

260
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,630
What did you say?

261
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,260
Repeat

262
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,200
what you just said.

263
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,860
Stop it.

264
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,160
If you agreed to the merger back then,

265
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,710
Xufeng would have got the funds

266
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,240
for equipment upgrade.

267
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,660
That fire caused by

268
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,390
equipment aging

269
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,430
wouldn't have happened.

270
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,750
You can't say that.

271
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,430
You...

272
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,450
Moping. Moping.

273
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,200
You're still blaming me?

274
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,760
I'm not blaming you.

275
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,950
But I won't change my mind about

276
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,150
what I believe is right, either.

277
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,430
Get out of here!

278
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,570
Calm down.

279
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,990
Moping.

280
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,430
Come on.

281
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,710
Sit down.

282
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,400
All right.

283
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,460
Moping.

284
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,000
Come on.

285
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,400
Sit down.

286
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,820
He's just a kid. Don't let him rattle your cage.

287
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,530
I'm so pissed.

288
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,220
Listen to what he said.

289
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,790
Are you planning to live here?

290
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,710
Why do you want to see me?

291
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,720
This is my last job

292
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,750
as the CFO of Free Unicorn.

293
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,450
This is a ledger

294
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,710
your father left me.

295
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,270
It records the money he lent

296
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,230
to his friends in private.

297
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,620
Not counting the interest,

298
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,380
the total amount

299
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,530
should be more than 5 million.

300
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,850
It can temporarily relieve

301
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,190
the financial pressure of factory renting of you.

302
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,470
Go have a try.

303
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,070
Where're the IOUs?

304
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,180
If there were IOUs,

305
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,800
I wouldn't have said "have a try".

306
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,080
Mr. Ye is still in a meeting.

307
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,720
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,700
Okay, thank you.

309
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,420
I've never borrowed money

310
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,720
from your dad.

311
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,440
Where are you?

312
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,630
Let's meet.

313
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,820
Where do you want me to wait for you?

314
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,180
How did you get in?

315
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,710
Didn't I tell you

316
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,150
to wait for me at the lobby cafe?

317
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,310
I have a membership card here.

318
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,750
Besides, I don't have

319
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,770
that much time to wait for you.

320
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:34,910
Go ahead.

321
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,030
Give me 10 more days.

322
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,020
Okay.

323
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,470
Are you planning to rent a factory

324
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,410
and keep Teng Yue's business going?

325
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,790
It's none of your business.

326
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,140
It seems that you still don't understand

327
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,230
what problems you're facing

328
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,430
after taking over Teng Yue.

329
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,380
Teng Yue has basically paid off all its debts

330
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,960
through auction.

331
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,570
Only dozens of workers

332
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,400
and 20,000 pairs of

333
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,870
unsold shoes are left.

334
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,690
You know it pretty well.

335
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,580
Making an investment is like taking a flight.

336
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,790
No matter how high you fly,

337
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,940
or how passionate you are,

338
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,520
the most important thing is to land safely.

339
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
If you want to get out of

340
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,960
your current plight as soon as possible,

341
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,550
there are two ways.

342
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,670
One,

343
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,300
sell Teng Yue to someone else.

344
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,800
I can help you with this.

345
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:27,880
Perhaps

346
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,490
you can also make a small profit out of it.

347
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,000
Xu Si.

348
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,270
Do you think I have so much time

349
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,520
that I just sell what I bought?

350
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,330
Do you think I'm joking around?

351
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,630
The second way

352
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,390
is to fire all the workers

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
and keep the label.

354
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,140
Find an OEM factory.

355
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,470
The only thing you'll need is an office.

356
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,710
They've worked for Teng Yue

357
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,040
for 30 to 40 years.

358
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,230
I can't do that.

359
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,670
Won't it be like if Zhang Wenshan took over Teng Yue...

360
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,960
No OEM factory

361
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,390
is willing to take over the workers together with the label.

362
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,360
I've never thought about finding an OEM factory.

363
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,000
But the problem is that you have neither money

364
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,900
nor a factory.

365
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,870
Even if I give you more time,

366
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,230
you'll still be sleeping on the streets

367
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,470
in 10 days.

368
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,480
I said it's none of your business.

369
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,550
I will take care of

370
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,420
Teng Yue's affairs.

371
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,480
Jiang Hu.

372
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,920
I'm only telling you this

373
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,950
because I treat you as a friend.

374
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,630
But it seems

375
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,000
it doesn't really concern you

376
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,190
whether

377
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,500
this dilapidated spaceship you're driving

378
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,770
named Teng Yue

379
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,450
will land

380
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,220
or crash.

381
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,260
Jiang Hu wants to continue Teng Yue's factory business,

382
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,740
and she wants to take the old workers along?

383
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,160
Oh my god.

384
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,910
She's digging her own grave.

385
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,020
This is a suicide attempt of entrepreneurship.

386
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,680
Go settle the case of Teng Yue

387
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,150
in 10 days.

388
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,990
Boss. Boss.

389
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,020
[Changle Restaurant]

390
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,840
[Xixingji]

391
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,670
Boss.

392
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,550
Take a look.

393
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,030
What do you think of

394
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,710
these selling points for our future?

395
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,160
Boss.

396
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,230
That...

397
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,150
That...

398
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,910
That person is here to pay you back.

399
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,190
I've reconciled

400
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,550
all the accounts.

401
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,340
What about the money?

402
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,470
Did you bring it?

403
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,230
I have no money now.

404
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,280
Are you kidding me?

405
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,750
How could you

406
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,100
welch on your debts so blatantly?

407
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,680
My dad lent some money

408
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,000
in private before.

409
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,990
If you can get it back for me,

410
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,060
no matter how much,

411
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,670
I'll use it to repay

412
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,480
your friends first.

413
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,210
Do I look like an idiot?

414
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,530
You owe my friends money,

415
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,580
and you want me to work for you?

416
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,910
This is the only way

417
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,830
you can get your arrears back from Teng Yue.

418
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,710
Are you threatening me?

419
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,480
I'd say it's a negotiation.

420
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,080
You think

421
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,010
there's nothing I can do to you,

422
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,530
right?

423
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,440
I'm just telling you.

424
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,290
This is the best way.

425
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,340
Think about it yourself.

426
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,300
Will you keep your promise?

427
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,660
What do you think?

428
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,990
Then it's a deal.

429
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,100
Repay my friends first

430
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,350
with the money I collect.

431
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,710
Deal.

432
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,820
There're no eternal enemies,

433
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,150
nor eternal friends.

434
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,790
What matters

435
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,970
is to be evenly matched.

436
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,990
If you don't learn how to kill two birds with one stone,

437
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,120
how can you dominate the martial world?

438
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,270
Get to the point.

439
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,140
Jiang Hu is really something.

440
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,510
She actually used our boss as a tool.

441
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,310
As the saying goes,

442
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,370
when Boss steps in,

443
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,190
he's old but vigorous,

444
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,940
old but strong,

445
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,630
and old...

446
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,580
But mature.

447
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,930
[Wu, Yang Jian's good friend]

448
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,670
If Boss hears what you say,

449
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,140
he'll beat you up and you'll be old and sick.

450
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,670
You're both oversimplifying it.

451
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,930
Are you questioning me?

452
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,210
I'm not questioning you.

453
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,200
So you're questioning me? Why?

454
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,180
I'm not questioning you either.

455
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,120
I'm questioning those people.

456
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,720
Nowadays,

457
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,830
those who owe money have the upper hand.

458
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,700
Don't you think so?

459
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,080
Since they managed to gain the upper hand,

460
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,740
they must have something up their sleeve.

461
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,790
In my opinion,

462
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,350
it can be summarized

463
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,220
into four words.

464
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,240
Lend me some money?

465
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,660
No shame at all!

466
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,660
Since I used to be your father's friend,

467
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,780
I'll give you 50% off

468
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,730
when you come to dine here.

469
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,230
What my dad gave you back then

470
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,080
was not a Free Unicorn discount card,

471
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,210
but 100,000 yuan

472
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,990
in cash.

473
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,070
And he didn't even ask you for an IOU

474
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,040
since he didn't want you to lose face.

475
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,850
No matter what you say,

476
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,110
I have no money.

477
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,690
So your friendship was fake?

478
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,370
You're making it easy for me.

479
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,280
Let's see.

480
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,150
Where should I hang it?

481
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:49,990
What are you doing?

482
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:50,640
Let's hang it here.

483
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,720
What are you doing?

484
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,790
Put it away.

485
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,050
Put it away.

486
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,480
Don't mess around here.

487
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,200
You're scaring my customers away.

488
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,180
Then shut it down.

489
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,310
If it weren't Mr. Jiang

490
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,150
who lent you money back then,

491
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,840
your restaurant should have shut down at that time.

492
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,550
I'm very happy that

493
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,190
you think of me

494
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
when you're in trouble.

495
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:08,480
For real.

496
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,800
You're giving me an opportunity

497
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,270
to repay your father.

498
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,460
Liu.

499
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,010
Yes.

500
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,510
Come here.

501
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,560
Mr. Wang.

502
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,450
You're a man of your word.

503
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,190
Call me uncle.

504
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,300
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

505
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,830
Withdraw all the money from my account

506
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,920
and give it to my niece.

507
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,630
After paying the bank loan interest yesterday,

508
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,270
there's only

509
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,670
8,600 yuan left on the account.

510
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,670
Look.

511
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,300
How could a person be like that?

512
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,620
If they push me too far,

513
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,810
I'll bring people here every day

514
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,710
and have a good talk about life and dreams

515
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,990
with their boss.

516
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,340
Can't you say something useful?

517
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,000
Can't you be more decent?

518
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,070
What's the use of being decent?

519
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,750
Haven't you had enough of their indifference these days?

520
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,280
I'm sorry.

521
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,620
I didn't expect you know how to apologize.

522
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,270
I only feel sorry after I apologize.

523
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,710
I didn't expect

524
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,990
you're serious about this, either.

525
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,430
About what?

526
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,210
I thought

527
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,250
you were

528
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,440
just sadfishing

529
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,490
under the guise of debt collection.

530
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,200
You must be happy,

531
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,270
seeing my sadness is real.

532
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,190
What surprised me the most is that

533
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,320
you, a pampered young lady,

534
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,950
would have your heels broken

535
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,380
to pay us back.

536
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,920
I really can't handle debt collection.

537
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,890
I just can't.

538
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,560
It's okay.

539
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,490
Leave it to me.

540
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,940
Isn't there a biggest debt left?

541
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,680
That person has been hiding from you for days.

542
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,210
I'm sure I can get it back.

543
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,230
Yang.

544
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,710
What's going on?

545
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,380
Yang?

546
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,930
I've never heard you call me that.

547
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,710
Get to the point.

548
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,220
Here's the thing.

549
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,620
C Club

550
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,430
is around the corner ahead.

551
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,550
The person we're looking for

552
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,310
is in there right now,

553
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,230
having dinner with someone.

554
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,480
What do you mean?

555
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,150
Are you going to C Club

556
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,850
to collect the debt?

557
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,920
It doesn't seem appropriate.

558
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,210
What's inappropriate about that?

559
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,160
You don't understand.

560
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,220
It's exactly because he's in this kind of place

561
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,860
that it'll be easier

562
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,380
for us

563
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,470
to put him on the spot.

564
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,640
At worst,

565
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,230
I'll be able to collect the interest for you.

566
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,230
Okay.

567
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,230
Let's go.

568
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:55,990
Wait.

569
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,910
There's one problem.

570
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,720
C Club

571
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,060
is a members-only club.

572
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,080
I have an idea.

573
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,060
Let's go in

574
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,190
through the back door...

575
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,870
I'm a member.

576
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,699
Let's go.

577
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,750
So it's not a problem.

578
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,190
This way, please.

579
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,040
What is

580
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,989
the most expensive wine here?

581
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,010
La Romanee Conti.

582
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,909
What's that?

583
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,650
How much is a bottle?

584
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,909
About 100,000 yuan.

585
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,170
Waiter.

586
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,900
The one she said, Conti whatever.

587
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,070
La Romanee Conti.

588
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,310
Yes.

589
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,949
That wine.

590
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,190
Get 10 bottles delivered to the private room.

591
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,510
We didn't order much this month.

592
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,300
Each table can only

593
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,260
order one bottle today.

594
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,030
Okay.

595
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,780
Then one bottle it is.

596
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,120
As of last quarter,

597
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,590
the growth of users...

598
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,170
Who are you?

599
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,850
Why did you barge in without knocking?

600
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,310
Which one is him?

601
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,530
Mr. Li, right?

602
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,370
You've not only aged,

603
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,200
but also lost your memory.

604
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,270
Look who this is.

605
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,000
Don't you recognize her?

606
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,420
Your creditor, Jiang Qisheng.

607
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,220
Let me help you recall it.

608
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,850
Come on.

609
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,600
Cheers.

610
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,280
Come on.

611
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,060
Make a wish.

612
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,180
Let me sing you a birthday song.

613
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,600
What wish?

614
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,030
Listen.

615
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm going to call the police.

616
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,960
No problem.

617
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,700
Call the police then.

618
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,090
My dad Jiang Qisheng

619
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,620
lent you 3 million when he was alive.

620
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,620
It's only right to pay your debt.

621
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,870
Even if the police come,

622
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,800
I would say the same thing.

623
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:43,990
Mr. Li.

624
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,710
You started your own business.

625
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,240
You should at least have some conscience and credibility.

626
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:48,800
Mr. Xu.

627
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,380
I didn't expect Baoxing

628
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,240
would be interested in

629
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,010
a deadbeat start-up company like this.

630
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,700
Aren't you worried that the money you invest

631
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,910
will be gone for good?

632
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,250
What nonsense are you talking about?

633
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,150
She's slandering me.

634
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,790
I didn't expect you're still

635
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,980
so willful, Ms. Jiang.

636
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,110
What's more effective than being angry

637
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,550
is taking out the IOU.

638
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,640
Whether you go to the police

639
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,980
or pursue the legal route,

640
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,070
no one will be able to welch on it.

641
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,790
Right?

642
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
Yes.

643
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,270
Show me the evidence,

644
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,370
or I'll sue you for defamation.

645
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,990
Sir.

646
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,090
This is

647
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,150
the La Romanee Conti you ordered.

648
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,440
Give it to me.

649
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,400
Is this how you serve your customers?

650
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,990
You just let random people

651
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,190
in like that?

652
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,250
We'll

653
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,010
bear some loss.

654
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,030
Take this bottle of wine

655
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,430
as the interest

656
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,710
of the money you borrowed.

657
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,050
This bottle of wine was ordered by Mr. Li over there.

658
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:38,960
Let's go.

659
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,020
You...

660
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,020
Are you a burglar?

661
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,480
I didn't order that wine.

662
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,800
Why did you deliver the wine without asking me?

663
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,040
Let me tell you.

664
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
I'm not paying for that.

665
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,310
What kind of place is this?

666
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,360
There are so many rules.

667
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,710
They only allow one bottle per table.

668
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,160
If we could get 20 bottles,

669
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,000
his debt would be cleared.

670
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,340
I'll ask my friend

671
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,480
to write off this bottle of wine as soon as possible.

672
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,020
Take it as the interest.

673
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,370
Don't worry.

674
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,730
That Li

675
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,160
can run, but he can't hide.

676
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,210
I'll go a few more times.

677
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:09,840
The interest will probably be enough

678
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,830
to pay off the principal.

679
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,090
Let's go.

680
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,870
To my restaurant.

681
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,660
I'll buy you wontons and wine.

682
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,170
What's that saying again?

683
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Have wontons with wine, and everything will be fine.

684
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,150
No, thanks.

685
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,620
I want to be alone for a while.

686
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,440
Okay.

687
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,230
What's wrong

688
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,020
with you?

689
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,240
What's with your service?

690
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,950
How could you just let

691
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,210
random people in?

692
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,710
I'm sorry.

693
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,920
It's the restaurant's mistake.

694
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,580
I'm really sorry.

695
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,510
I'm really sorry.

696
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,250
Sorry?

697
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,520
If this happens again,

698
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,510
I won't come anymore.

699
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,660
I'm sorry.

700
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,680
Mr. Xu, I'm sorry.

701
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,430
I'm sorry you have to see this.

702
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,000
Look.

703
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,020
There're all kinds of weird people

704
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,600
nowadays.

705
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,190
She even dared to come and blackmail me

706
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,110
without any evidence.

707
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:04,970
Mr. Li.

708
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,840
The financial report

709
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,030
that you provided

710
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,190
does record an investment of 3 million yuan

711
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,570
from an unknown source.

712
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:13,990
Well,

713
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,420
that money is...

714
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,660
It has nothing to do with me.

715
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,850
The Micro Dance Club project

716
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,320
is witnessing great user growth.

717
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,760
The profit model is also getting clearer gradually.

718
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:25,970
But

719
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,080
Baoxing also pays special attention to

720
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,600
the personal brand of the founder.

721
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,020
It's a bad thing

722
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,260
if your personal reputation

723
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,860
affects the project,

724
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,560
right?

725
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,190
Solve

726
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,060
your debt problem first.

727
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,380
This way, our future development

728
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,660
can be more guaranteed.

729
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,100
What do you think?

730
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,450
Okay.

731
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,550
Okay.

732
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,640
I have some other business to attend to.

733
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,540
See you.

734
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:51,950
Stay.

735
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,970
Mr. Xu.

736
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,530
By the way,

737
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,010
don't forget to pay the bill

738
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,710
for that wine just now.

739
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,510
[Teng Yue Shoes]

740
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,550
Master Zhang.

741
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,020
Why are you still here?

742
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,710
Well,

743
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,880
I see you've been out

744
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,830
a lot these days.

745
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,150
You don't have any

746
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,240
convenient means of transportation.

747
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:13,770
We

748
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,140
rented an electric moped for you.

749
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,020
You won't waste any time if there's something urgent,

750
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:19,990
right?

751
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,420
Here.

752
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,020
The moped

753
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,470
is parked in the yard.

754
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,680
Take it and have a look.

755
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:30,810
Take it.

756
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,980
I'll go have a look.

757
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,400
Boss.

758
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,630
Move.

759
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,440
Make way.

760
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,670
Go away.

761
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,830
Go away.
