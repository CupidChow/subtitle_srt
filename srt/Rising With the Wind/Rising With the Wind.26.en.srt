00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,360
Let me introduce.

6
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,750
This is Hong Die,

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,520
my aunt.

8
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,470
You can call her aunt too.

9
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,190
Hello, Aunt.

10
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,770
Hello.

11
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,479
This is Jiang Hu.

12
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,830
She's my...

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,479
No need to introduce.

14
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,400
I know.

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,150
I saw it just now.

16
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,420
My girlfriend has a fever,

17
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,669
so I brought her home

18
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,389
to take care of her.

19
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,080
You have a fever?

20
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,900
You should eat more.

21
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,950
Have some of my

22
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,830
pickled vegetables.

23
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,170
You'll definitely feel much better after eating it.

24
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,110
Come on.

25
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,700
Eat more.

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,260
I queued up to buy

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,990
these buns.

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,760
They're very delicious.

29
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,140
Also, the eggs.

30
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,390
They're very nutritious.

31
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,550
Now that you're sick,

32
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,350
you should eat more.

33
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,070
You know?

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,230
Also, the vegetables.

35
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,260
You need to get balanced nutrition.

36
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,240
Have more vegetables.

37
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,230
Don't just eat porridge.

38
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,510
Thank you, Aunt.

39
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,940
Aunt.

40
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,430
She just has a fever.

41
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,550
You moved all the food away.

42
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,550
What should I eat?

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,560
Well.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,040
There are still so many here.

45
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,590
Eat this.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,410
Your girlfriend is sick.

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,240
It's a good time for you to express yourself.

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,390
You're only eating yourself.

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,560
You're not taking care of her at all.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,240
It's okay.

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,000
My cold is not that serious, actually.

52
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,280
You have to take it seriously.

53
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,510
I brought a lot of ingredients here.

54
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,190
I'll make a pot of

55
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,950
Bamboo Shoot Soup with Fresh and Pickled Streaky Pork

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,740
for you later.

57
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,890
No need to bother.

58
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,590
I'm going back to the factory very soon.

59
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,490
Back to the factory?

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,390
Is that where you work?

61
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,110
Or

62
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,710
is it your own factory?

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes.

64
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,910
It's my family's factory.

65
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,110
It's called Teng Yue.

66
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,590
Have you heard of it?

67
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,350
Teng Yue?

68
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,790
You held a new product launch conference online

69
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,630
the other day, right?

70
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,350
Yes.

71
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,510
No kidding.

72
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,070
I watched that livestream from beginning to end.

73
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,829
It was really creative

74
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,710
and full of great ideas.

75
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,710
I liked it very much.

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,150
To be honest,

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,190
I bought a pair of shoes myself.

78
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,550
Really?

79
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,079
Thank you so much for your support.

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,290
After you recover,

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,780
maybe you can take me

82
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,950
to your factory

83
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,829
for a visit.

84
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,570
Sure.

85
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,510
As long as you have time.

86
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,110
Anytime.

87
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,730
He hasn't told you, has he?

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,780
Actually, we also have a factory

89
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,910
that produces cups.

90
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,070
Xu Si's mother

91
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,080
and I are in charge of the operation.

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,120
We'd also really

93
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,660
like to

94
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,190
communicate more with

95
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,810
the excellent "factory second generation"

96
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,230
like you.

97
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,390
How about

98
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,769
we add each other

99
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,790
on WeChat?

100
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,589
Of course.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,519
We should

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,110
learn more from you.

103
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,510
Okay.

104
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,190
Accept my request.

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,280
Added.

106
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,350
What did you just say?

107
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,010
You want to learn from me?

108
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,670
Yes.

109
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,670
If that's the case,

110
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,710
I can teach you something

111
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,110
from my practical experience throughout these years right here.

112
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,909
This guy.

113
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,930
Beware of him.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,350
Didn't he tell you

115
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,350
that he's an investor?

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,760
He's that kind of investor

117
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,550
who specializes in

118
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,150
low-price purchase and high-price selling,

119
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,150
as well as the acquisition of

120
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,280
old enterprises in traditional industries.

121
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,110
To put it nicely,

122
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,550
he's disposing of non-performing assets.

123
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,600
But I think he's up to no good.

124
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,350
Be careful not to let him

125
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,670
sell your factory.

126
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,360
Nip it in the bud

127
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,580
so that you won't get hurt.

128
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,640
Aunt.

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,830
It's still early in the morning,

130
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,350
yet you've seen

131
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,470
what you should and shouldn't see,

132
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,000
and heard

133
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,150
what you should and shouldn't hear.

134
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,300
Maybe it's time for you to leave?

135
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,320
How can I cultivate my relationship with her

136
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,010
with you here?

137
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,740
Well,

138
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,880
I won't be the third wheel then.

139
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,710
It's okay.

140
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,270
How about this?

141
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,030
When you have time,

142
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,909
let Xu Si take you

143
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,040
home for dinner.

144
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,150
Xu Si's mother

145
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,909
is very good at making soups.

146
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,820
It's her specialty.

147
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,670
Okay.

148
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,760
Alright.

149
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,909
Let me see you off.

150
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,110
Okay.

151
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,930
I'm leaving then.

152
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,230
Let's text each other on WeChat.

153
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,940
Okay.

154
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,470
Bye.

155
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,470
Goodbye, Aunt.

156
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,909
Aunt.

157
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,130
Don't you feel bad

158
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,110
slandering your own nephew?

159
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,030
How is this slandering?

160
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm just reminding you

161
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,240
to get down to business

162
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,420
and focus on your relationship.

163
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,720
Don't think about

164
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,100
useless work all day.

165
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,420
You should waste no time

166
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,110
investing a fortunetelling APP.

167
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,710
Why should I?

168
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,830
It's efficacious.

169
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,640
Look, that Orchid Cactus

170
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,890
has only been placed in your house for such a short period of time,

171
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,210
and it already got you a romantic relationship.

172
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
What does it have to do with the flower?

173
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,550
It's because your nephew is nice

174
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,230
and handsome.

175
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,040
That's also true.

176
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,210
I'm leaving.

177
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,230
Bye.

178
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,890
Be careful.

179
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,350
What are you doing?

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,840
Let's carry on.

181
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,390
What?

182
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,520
Carry on what we were doing just now.

183
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,659
Stop it.

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,510
Stop cleaning.

185
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,830
I'll ask the cleaning lady to clean it up.

186
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm at your house.

187
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,280
I should at least pretend to love cleaning.

188
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,880
You and your aunt are really close.

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,530
What you see is just what it appears to be.

190
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,030
In the eyes of her and my mom,

191
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,490
I'm just an investor that

192
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,440
would do anything to succeed.

193
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,990
So

194
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,159
those who know you the best

There must be another way.

and it's not the perfect love

387
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,980
I expected.

388
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,940
But for no reason,

389
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,370
what happened recently

390
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,870
pushed me towards him step by step.

391
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,900
After your father passed away,

392
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,150
you've been holding on

393
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,550
all by yourself.

394
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,470
It must be hard for you.

395
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,230
But if

396
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,990
you just want someone to rely on,

397
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,150
I don't think Xu Si

398
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,390
is the most reliable choice.

399
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,300
I also thought about it for a long time.

400
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,240
But recently, I've been thinking,

401
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,510
why don't I

402
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,670
give it a try?

403
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,030
There must be something

404
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,150
I'm lingering on

405
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,420
that brings me to him.

406
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,470
Xu Si

407
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,680
is actually quite good.

408
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,430
Then follow

409
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,530
your heart

410
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,620
and don't let go.

412
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,360
Zhaoyang.

413
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,660
Zhaoyang.

414
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,230
I washed some strawberries.

415
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,950
Come and have some.

416
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,920
No need.

417
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,860
I'm heading out now.

418
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,110
Then I'll save some for you to eat when you're back.

419
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,330
I'm not eating. Bye.

420
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,250
Mom.

421
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,730
Where are you?

422
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,510
In the kitchen.

423
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,990
You're making soup?

424
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,710
I've got an appetite for soup

425
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,710
since you cooked soup for me

426
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,510
last time.

427
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,230
Here.

428
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,750
This bowl is for you.

429
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,380
Let's go.

430
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,130
Why did you

431
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,820
come back all of a sudden?

432
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,560
I'm a little tired today.

433
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,710
So I didn't want to

434
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,380
drive all the way back to my place.

435
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,230
What happened?

436
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,070
Nothing.

437
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,930
I heard from your aunt that

438
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,120
you have a girlfriend.

439
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,960
About Jiang Qisheng.

440
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,830
We met a few times when he was alive.

441
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,650
He was

442
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,720
a very capable entrepreneur.

443
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,630
I heard that

444
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,530
his daughter Jiang Hu has been

445
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,150
supporting that factory

446
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,560
all by herself.

447
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,720
It's not easy.

448
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,750
She has no one to rely on.

449
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,790
If you really like her,

450
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,930
treat her well.

451
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,610
Don't have other thoughts.

452
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,070
What thoughts can I have?

453
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,110
Why are you feeling guilty?

454
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,520
I'm not.

455
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,190
What are you doing?

456
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,040
It's too salty.

457
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,330
I haven't had any yet.

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,440

460
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,070
You're here.

461
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,970
Is that true?

462
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,880
Will Lidu really offer Teng Yue

463
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,990
a counter

464
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,990
along with financial support?

465
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,030
Of course it's true.

466
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,270
The event marketing

467
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,470
you did with Shangchun Art Project last time

468
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,470
had a great influence

469
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,150
in the industry.

470
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,940
It just so happens that

471
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:43,990
they are also

472
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,990
the key client we're introducing

473
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,670
into the Chinese Fashion Festival.

474
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,070
I've talked to

475
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,930
Mr. Hua of Shangchun Art Project.

476
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,320
Mr. Hua recognizes Jiang Hu's talent,

477
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,410
and also agreed

478
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,800
to open a joint shop

479
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,710
with Teng Yue in our store.

480
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,310
That's so

481
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,640
thoughtful of you.

482
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,990
It's just

483
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,060
Jiang Hu...

484
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,590
Is Jiang Hu

485
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,720
still considering

486
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,310
whether to cooperate with Lidu?

487
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,600
What exactly is the misunderstanding

488
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,250
between you and Jiang Hu?

489
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,600
It's not a misunderstanding, actually.

490
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,520
It's okay.

491
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,840
After you go back,

492
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,190
you can discuss it with her again.

493
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,670
In fact, Lidu and Shangchun Art Project's

494
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,100
cross-industry joint shop

495
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,150
is an innovation.

496
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,150
When these two brands join hands,

497
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,160
there'll be a great amount of

498
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,700
publicity and promotion.

499
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,240
Our executive meeting

500
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,990
reached unanimous agreement

501
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,820
on this proposal.

502
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,150
But Big Boss

503
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,950
has one request.

504
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,510
What is it?

505
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,150
Your marketing plan

506
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,350
has to pass our review.

507
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:42,990
Besides,

508
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,870
we need to check

509
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,890
the overall sales of the event.

510
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,770
Marketing is Jiang Hu's specialty.

511
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,080
As for the sales,

512
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,940
I have confidence in it.

513
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,750
Later,

514
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,630
I'll go back

515
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,470
and discuss it with Jiang Hu.

516
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,420
Gao Yi,

517
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,630
thank you so much.

518
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,700
You don't have to be so courteous in front of me.

519
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,630
Actually, I also hope

520
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,560
I can do my best

521
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,910
to help Teng Yue.

522
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,880
How are you feeling these days?

523
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,030
Much better.

524
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
The swelling is gone.

525
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,650
Have some water.

526
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,990
There's no rush.

527
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,950
You can start later.

528
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,210
I feel uneasy if I don't start now.

529
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,150
Have some warm water.

530
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
It's a little bit hot.

531
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,310
Fortunately, you've got my back

532
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,550

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,660
This...

536
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,190
Why is this project proposal

537
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,170
still here?

538
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,990
I put it in.

539
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,310
If it's just an event,

540
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,070
we don't have to participate.

541
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,870
But this Chinese Fashion Festival

542
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,390
is the first large-scale joint event

543
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:01,990

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,460
Lidu Chinese Fashion and Culture Festival.

546
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,210
I said we're not going.

547
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,830
This is an opportunity for Teng Yue.

548
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,660
Isn't it a pity if we give it up?

549
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,680
If dad were here,

550
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,440
would he participate?

551
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,460
Of course.

552
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,580
He once said to me,

553
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,410
in the market,

554
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,500
even if you were stabbed by that person,

555
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,310
as long as your business can be developed,

556
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,520
you can still cooperate with him.

557
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,510
Gao Yi did cheat your dad before,

558
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,550
but I've done research on

559
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,740
this Chinese Fashion Festival.

560
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,810
It suits

561
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,190
Teng Yue's offline promotion needs

562
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,820
perfectly.

563
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,220
But Gao Yi...

564
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,860
Mr. Fang joined our livestream that day.

565
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Although he joined it, he didn't place an order.

566
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,140
Do you know why?

567
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,740
He has realized

568
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,950
the scarcity of Teng Yue's new products

569
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,240
in the market.

570
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,900
But he's not 100% sure.

571
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,150
So we need to

572
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,320
give him that confidence.

573
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,730
No wonder when Zhaoyang

574
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,600
told me she met Mr. Fang,

575
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,830
she hesitated.

576
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,190
I know you can't get over

577
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,100
the fact that Gao Yi betrayed the Jiang family.

578
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,890
But this obstacle

579
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,870
is nothing compared to

580
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,310
the difficulties your father

581
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,730
had encountered in business.

582
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,330
So, can you get over it yourself?

583
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,260
You can't

584
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,520
forgive Gao Yi as well, can you?

585
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,890
I couldn't.

586
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,290
But now I've figured it out.

587
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,590
Given Gao Yi's ability,

588
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,230
even though Peace Loan

589
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,630
made your father fail in his investment,

590
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,620
so what?

591
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,640
Jiang Qisheng had the ability to turn it around.

592
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,230
If your father

593
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,510
hadn't had a health problem

594
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,670
and passed away all of a sudden,

595
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,140
nothing would have changed.

596
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,370
Don't underestimate your father.

597
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,670
And there's no need to take Gao Yi

598
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,180
as your father's competitor at all.

599
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,880
Promise me one thing.

600
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,440
Make the right decision

601
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,070
when you are completely

602
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,270
sober and calm.

603
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,070
This matter

604
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,110
is very important to Teng Yue.

605
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,230
Take your time.

606
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,380
Think it through and let me know.

607
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,230
Hello.

608
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,030
Do you have time?

609
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,310
Have a drink with me.

610
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,690
Yes.

611
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,450
Send me the address.

612
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,500
I'll be right there.

613
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,960
Mr. Fang.

614
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,550
Come on.

615
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,320
Have a seat.

616
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,620
Sorry to keep you waiting.

617
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,830
Sorry to

618
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,190
call you here suddenly.

619
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,910
Here's the thing.

620
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm taking a flight abroad tonight.

621
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,110
I won't be back until half a month later.

622
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,440
So I can only use this time

623
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,490
to have a talk with you.

624
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,640
It's okay.

625
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,470
I also wanted

626
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,620
to see you

627
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,570
to talk about our cooperation.

628
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,420
Here's the thing.

629
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,390
I plan to open

630
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,470
a brand collection store.

631
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,050
I want to invite Teng Yue to join it.

632
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,450
I want to hear your opinion.

633
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,390
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

634
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,990
But

635
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,790
I have another favor to ask.

636
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:03,910
Go ahead.

637
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,310
I want a shop

638
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,640
in 4 of your

639
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,750
Xinghui Square's branches,

640
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,670
namely Beijing, Shanghai,

641
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,180
Suzhou, and Chengdu.

642
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,130
You are so well-informed.

643
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,670
I only just got

644
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,290
these four branches.

645
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,390
And you're already thinking about making use of it.

646
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,950
Learning about

647
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,710
the stores in every block,

648
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,520
every area, and every city

649
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,710
is what manufacturers should do conscientiously.

650
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,990
But I think

651
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,440
you're taking too big of a leap.

652
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,230
These four stores

653
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,670
are the most popular stores

654
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,640
in the CBDs.

655
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,270
The rent is extremely high.

656
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,850
According to my presumption,

657
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,910
only brands of Aneda's scale

658
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,880
will be able

659
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,860
to take it.

660
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,510
What I want is to take precedence.

661
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,100
The first batch of Teng Yue's offline stores

662
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,330
must be the best.

663
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,870
So you've never

664
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,820
taken Free Unicorn as your rival.

665
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,980
What you want is to compete with Aneda one-on-one.

666
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,680
Since you're Teng Yue's

667
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,020
first-class agent,

668
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,430
I can sell

669
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,070
all the shoes to you

670
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,310
at ex-factory price.

671
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,610
I won't add a penny.

672
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,110
Aneda

673
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,870
could never offer you

674
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,290
such profit margin.

675
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,760
Don't you want to make profit?

676
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,590
If you let Teng Yue have these 4 shops,

677
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,650
I'll be making profit.

678
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,540
Mr. Fang.

679
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,990
Mr. Fang.

680
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,690
For a moment just now,

681
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,080
I felt like

682
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,140
the one sitting across from me

683
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
was your father.

684
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,140
Mr. Fang.

685
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,770
For the sake

686
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,760
of your friendship with my father for over a decade,

687
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,760
can you help me this once?

688
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,850
All right.

689
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,790
I'll ask the lawyer to draft a contract.

690
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,389
Wait for me.

691
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,960
After I come back,

692
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,110
let's set a good date

693
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,949
and get it signed.

694
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,830
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

695
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,910
You asked me out in the middle of the night.

696
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,650
Are you trying to get back with me?

697
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,790
You finally realized

698
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,880
how good and beautiful I am,

699
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,010
but it's too late.

700
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,810
I have a boyfriend now.

701
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,880
This is immoral.

702
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,830
I asked you out to solve my problems,

703
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,350
not to make me uncomfortable.

704
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,490
So rare.

705
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,480
You're asking me

706
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,980
to solve your problems.

707
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,770
And you're even drinking.

708
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,900
That problem must be pretty serious.

709
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,190
Go ahead.

710
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,550
I'll charge you

711
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,500
the standard consultation fee of a PR company.

712
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,910
In all honesty.

713
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,850
Fair and square.

714
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,830
I have a friend

715
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,770
who's in love with a girl.

716
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,870
This girl

717
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,540
used to have a crush on another guy,

718
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,190
but they never dated.

719
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,200
However, this girl

720
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,550
gave my friend

721
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,270
clothes of the brand that other guy likes

722
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,700
as a gift.

723
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,930
So what do you think

724
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,060
this girl means?

725
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,430
You're talking about Jiang Hu, right?

726
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,150
The story

727
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,590
you made up

728
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,740
can't escape my sharp eyes.

729
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,910
Just do your

730
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,270
consultation service.

731
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,660
This is not the Discovery Channel.

732
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,760
I don't need you to reveal the mystery.

733
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,760
Sorry. Okay.

734
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,220
Well...

735
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,920
Jiang Hu...

736
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,660
What's her type like?

737
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,000
Not as good as me anyway.

738
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,400
You are so confident.

739
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,470
So why are you worried that

740
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,680
she still has feelings for him?

741
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,170
Everyone has a past.

742
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,780
Aren't you the same?

743
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,190
Maybe the brand

744
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,150
is just a coincidence.

745
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,620
What matters is the present.

746
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,580
Whoever is with her now

747
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,960
is the final winner.

748
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,920
That makes sense.

749
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,000
And maybe...

750
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,190
Maybe what?

751
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,210
Maybe Ms. Jiang

752
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
just likes that brand's clothes.

753
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,880
And she gifted everyone

754
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,340
that she friend-zoned clothes of that brand.

755
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,480
Didn't you ask those around her

756
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,450
if they've received the same gift?

757
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,380
You just want to watch the world burn, don't you?

758
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,640
Although it's a pity,

759
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,960
you've never been like this

760
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,190
back when

761
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,270
we were dating.

762
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,510
Well,

763
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,880
a villain like you will get what's coming to you.

764
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,990
I really want to

765
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,470
make a toast to Ms. Jiang.

766
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,990
Hello.

767
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,440
I'd like the same drink as him.

768
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,030
Thank you.

769
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,910
It's so late. Why are you still out here?

770
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,270
I'm waiting for you.

771
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,940
Waiting for me?

772
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,210
I went to see Gao Yi

773
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,060
today.

774
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,110
He said...

775
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,950
I've settled the deal

776
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,660
with Fang Yuan Trading Company.

777
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,790
Fang agreed

778
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,510
to let us rent

779
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,590
the best four Xinghui Square's shops

780
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,070
as Teng Yue's flagship shops.

781
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,340
Whatever Fang Yuan Trading Company

782
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,690
offers us,

783
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,990
we can get more

784
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,900
from Lidu.

785
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,590
Gao Yi told me today that

786
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,260
he has convinced Shangchun Art Project

787
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,580
to cooperate with Teng Yue

788
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,190
and open a joint shop at the Chinese Fashion and Culture Festival.

789
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,340
As long as Teng Yue's plan

790
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,290
can pass Lidu's project review,

791
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,420
I think

792
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,660
our overall sales at the Chinese Fashion Festival

793
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,100
won't be bad.

794
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,910
With Fang Yuan Trading Company,

795
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,590
we don't need Lidu anymore.

796
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,990
With Lidu,

797
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,950
we also don't need

798
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,080
to cooperate with Fang Yuan Trading Company.

799
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,470
Why are you

800
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,030
so against Fang Yuan Trading Company?

801
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,980
In terms of business,

802
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,400
the future plan of Lidu

803
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,210
is better for Teng Yue's development.

804
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,410
Besides, their positioning of Chinese fashion

805
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,330
this time

806
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,500
is also more suitable for

807
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,330
our brand image.

808
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,540
In terms of personal reasons,

809
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,830
we have been friends

810
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,910
with Gao Yi for over ten years.

811
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,890
Besides, he has always wanted to help us.

812
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,020
Xiang Zhaoyang.

813
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,840
Don't be so naive, Okay?

814
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,520
All that Gao Yi does

815
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,470
is not for you

816
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,470
or me,

817
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,080
but for himself.

818
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,580
It's to make up for his guilt.

819
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,150
What exactly happened

820
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,510
between you and Gao Yi?

821
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,890
You just need to know

822
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,730
what you see and hear

823
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,140
is not all the facts.

824
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,780
I have my own reasons.

825
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,270
Can't you

826
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,460
just seek peace

827
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,910
and let go of the past?

828
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,390
Why should I forgive him?

829
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,800
Why should I give him a chance

830
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,040
to forgive himself?

831
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,160
Fine.

832
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,400
Leaving aside Gao Yi

833
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,470
and Lidu,

834
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,440
you can cooperate with anyone you want,

835
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,430
except Fang Yuan Trading Company.

836
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,510
Why not?

837
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,230
If you cooperate with Fang Yuan Trading Company,

838
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,810
I'll leave Teng Yue.

839
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,440
Don't you think

840
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,150
you are

841
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,520
just being unreasonable?

842
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,950
You won't be

843
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,510
designing

844
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,460
-only for Fang.
-Because he doesn't deserve it.

845
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,050
He'll only defile my works.

846
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,760
You really have double standards.

847
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,400
Didn't you just ask me

848
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,630
to seek peace?

849
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,520
And now you're...

850
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,990
It's because he molested me!

851
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,460
Forget it.

852
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,150
Make your choice.
