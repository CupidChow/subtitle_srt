Cold...

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,690
So cold...

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,090
It isn't cold today.

43
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,370
Why is she so cold?

44
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,650
How could there be such strong cold energy inside her?

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,790
So cold...

46
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,180
Where is this cold energy coming from?

47
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,410
Let me hold that for you.

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,650
It's fine.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,570
This flower looks nice too.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,500
Lord Hei.

51
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,340
I already made it clear to you last time,

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,810
didn't I?

53
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,500
Yes, you did.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,740
You said forcing a melon off the vine never tastes sweet.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,090
So what are your intentions now?

56
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,220
What are you trying to do?

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,900
These are melons I picked from the Celestial Palace disciples'

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,810
herb garden by force.

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,740
They're very sweet.

60
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:06,970
Try some.

61
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,370
It is sweet.

62
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,900
Right?

63
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,690
But

64
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,220
I don't care. What are you going to do about it?

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,860
Wait. Where are you sending this?

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,100
To the Grandmistress's room.

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,660
She said the flowers and plants from Grain Rain Vale look different

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,250
from those outside and very beautiful,

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,130
so I was assigned to deliver them.

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,690
You intend to just pick them and send them as is?

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,540
I was careless for a moment.

72
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,940
How could we send them without preparing them first?

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,540
Have you forgotten our rules for hosting guests?

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,500
Who's there?

75
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,980
Watch your step.

76
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,500
Oh, you're among the Grandmistress's friends.

77
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,210
What did you mean

78
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,300
by preparing them?

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,540
These flowers and plants need to be tidied up

80
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,740
before they can be presented as a gift to the Grandmistress.

81
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,860
That's the proper etiquette.

82
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,300
Who made these silly rules?

83
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,180
I'm not sure,

84
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,620
but it's always been that way.

85
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,940
What I mean is

86
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,010
I think the flowers this disciple picked are beautiful as they are.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,860
I believe the Grandmistress

88
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,890
would be pleased with them no matter what.

89
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,690
Yes, I'm sure Tingyan isn't that fussy.

90
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,810
She might not be particular,

91
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,660
but we should still show our sincerity.

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,500
The rules of the Celestial Palace are so strict.

93
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,770
As someone from the Demon Realm, I just don't get it.

94
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,770
They look exactly the same as before to me.

95
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,570
Isn't this just unnecessary?

96
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,210
Never mind.

97
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,100
We won't bother you two any longer.

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,980
Excuse us.

99
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,450
Let's go.

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,300
Did you sleep well?

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,690
No, I feel so cold.

102
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,370
Did anything unusual happen

103
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,420
after I left yesterday?

104
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,940
Yesterday?

105
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,300
Nothing.

106
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,890
I just suddenly felt very cold.

107
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,300
Feng Qi said some strange things

108
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,740
to me.

109
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,010
Something about me having been here before.

110
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,130
I'm going to find him.

111
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,250
What's wrong?

112
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,100
You don't look well.

113
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,130
Don't tell me you're going to pick a fight with him?

114
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,570
Your cold energy has suddenly grown stronger.

115
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,010
I suspect this isn't a coincidence.

116
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,370
There's something strange going on.

117
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,980
I think Feng Qi is hiding something from us.

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,250
I'll use a Truth Spell to find out.

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,370
Don't do it.

120
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,770
You have issues with Feng Qi already.

121
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,180
I don't want you two to fight again.

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,500
If there's something to ask, I'll go.

123
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,010
By yourself?

124
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,010
It'll be fine.

125
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,330
Don't worry.

126
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,180
Grandmaster.

127
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,620
Nianjiu.

128
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,420
Have you noticed anything strange here

129
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,540
these past few days?

130
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,980
Hongluo and I saw Su Changqing

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,210
have someone tidy up the flowers and plants for Tingyan.

132
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,540
It seemed unnecessary,

133
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,940
and they worried Tingyan might not be pleased

134
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,740
and blame them.

135
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,250
But Tingyan isn't the picky type.

136
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,060
And for Su Changqing to be Tingyan's senior,

137
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,940
he ought to know her better.

138
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,010
Check around there again, discreetly.

139
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,690
See if there's anything else unusual.

140
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,970
But didn't you already use

141
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,210
the Truth Spell on them last time

142
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,940
and find nothing wrong?

143
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,900
That's true.

144
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,970
Though the Truth Spell can compel someone

145
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,970
to speak the truth,

146
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,380
its effect is limited to what they know.

147
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,090
Understood.

148
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,300
These flowers look a bit odd,

149
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,610
but they're just ordinary flowers.

150
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,850
These flowers and plants need to be tidied up

151
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,020
before they can be presented as a gift to the Grandmistress.

152
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,730
What secret are they trying to hide?

153
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,490
No wonder they're using spiritual power to tend these flowers.

154
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,420
Something must be wrong with the plants around here.

155
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,300
Has Sima Jiao grown suspicious?

156
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,420
Everything is proceeding smoothly as you said, Preceptor.

157
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,020
That's good to hear.

158
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,420
Preceptor.

159
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,060
I trust you won't harm Yan,

160
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,020
so I'm following your plan.

161
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,810
Will Yan's memories return?

162
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,090
Of course.

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,450
This benefits both you and me.

164
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,060
Things are going well so far.

165
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,730
Mr. Feng, you need only find a chance

166
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,730
to tell Shi Yan the cost of that anklet.

167
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,660
Then she'll remove it herself.

168
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,450
I understand.

169
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,780
Someone's coming.

170
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,570
Yan!

171
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,660
Grandmaster.

172
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,060
Good. Everyone's here.

173
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,900
Tingyan and I plan to stay a while longer

174
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,810
and open a few more spirit veins for Grain Rain Vale

175
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,140
as a reward.

176
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,060
Grandmaster, you're too courteous.

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,210
That...

178
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,690
That reward is too generous for us to accept.

179
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,420
Not at all.

180
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,450
Back at the Celestial Palace,

181
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,850
I once allocated you a spirit vein as well.

182
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,610
Of course.

183
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,850
You took good care of me back then.

184
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,090
I will never forget that kindness.

185
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,690
We will always remember your favor.

186
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,300
I'm sure Dongyang Zhenren

187
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,660
remembers this well.

188
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,660
Indeed.

189
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,780
The air here is so fresh.

190
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,260
It's been a long time since I last smelled anything like this.

191
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,210
Even the stones in Grain Rain Vale seem

192
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,490
to give off a faint fragrance.

193
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,490
Did... did I crush the stones too hard

194
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,660
and break them?

195
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,940
That's impossible.

196
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,300
This waterfall holds the bond you've had since childhood.

197
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,780
Over the years,

198
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,440
while you were away, it slowly infused itself into the stones.

199
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,210
Now that you're back,

200
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,780
it has returned as well.

201
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,490
I've lived here before?

202
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,330
This lake is where you grew up.

203
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,730
But I'm not a fish.

204
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,300
There's no way I lived in the water.

205
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,690
Did you remember something?

206
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,060
Remember what?

207
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,900
Yan,

208
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,420
you were once a Frost Fish.

209
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,020
That's why you have

210
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,810
the extreme-cold nature.

211
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,260
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

212
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,180
I'm not.

213
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,180
Back then, You Chi feared my father's power

214
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,260
and plotted against him,

215
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,420
wiping out my entire clan.

216
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,260
Preceptor Mingli, seeing I still had a breath of life,

217
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,300
secretly cast me into this lake,

218
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,810
leaving me a chance to survive.

219
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,090
It was then

220
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,450
that you appeared.

221
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,300
I wonder how things are on Tingyan's side.

222
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,810
But I have no memories of what you said.

223
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,380
But I remember it all.

224
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,180
You were once a Frost Fish,

225
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,850
but Demon Lord You Chi forged you into a human form.

226
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,690
By chance, you saved me here.

227
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,540
You even tore off

228
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,900
a scale from your chest

229
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,140
to save me.

230
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,780
How could I ever forget such a bond?

231
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,970
You say I saved you?

232
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,730
Do you think

233
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,330
I'm the woman you've been searching for?

234
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,900
It's not what I think.

235
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,610
It's that you are indeed her.

236
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,180
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,540
I'm not the one you're looking for.

238
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,970
It's all right.

239
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,570
Maybe you just haven't remembered yet.

240
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,260
If you stay here a few more days,

241
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,180
you'll recover your past memories soon.

242
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,300
You mean this place can help me regain my memories?

243
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,330
That's right.

244
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,260
That has been my wish all along.

245
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,540
So Feng Qi intentionally brought me here

246
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,490
to help me recover my memories when I was a Frost Fish?

247
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,940
If you can remember Sima Jiao,

248
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,900
you can surely remember me.

249
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,810
That's a different matter.

250
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,830
The person you seek

251
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,660
likely vanished long ago,

252
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,730
their soul scattered to the winds.

253
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,060
That's why I am what I am now.

254
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,140
Those memories won't be mine.

255
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,020
Do you understand

256
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,450
what I mean?

257
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,610
Yan.

258
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,180
Yan!

259
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,810
Grandmaster,

260
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,690
there's definitely something wrong with the flowers and plants here.

261
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,850
Look.

262
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,610
It's like they've been corrupted by demonic energy.

263
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,690
Then what about the cold energy inside me?

264
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,690
Feng Qi told me

265
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,690
I'm a Frost Fish raised here.

266
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,660
Could the recent surge in my cold energy be due

267
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,940
to this place's influence?

268
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,140
Did he really say

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,610
you were raised here as a Frost Fish?

270
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,420
Yes.

271
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,470
Cold energy and demonic energy.

272
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,940
Grain Rain Vale is supposed to be

273
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,570
a blessed sanctuary within the Demon Realm.

274
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,450
How could it be more complicated than the outside world?

275
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,380
Dongyang Zhenren and the disciples from the Immortal Realm

276
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,450
all live here.

277
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,260
Surely they wouldn't settle

278
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,690
in a place filled with strife.

279
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,140
Unless my master and those here lied to us.

280
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,710
But Grandmaster,

281
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,210
you already used the Truth Spell on them.

282
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,850
As I've said,

283
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,300
the Truth Spell can compel someone to speak the truth,

284
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,900
but it isn't flawless.

285
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,540
What do you mean?

286
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,850
Just now, I questioned them about the Celestial Palace.

287
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,060
There were discrepancies in the details

288
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,450
compared to what the real Dongyang Zhenren would say.

289
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,090
Do you remember

290
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,020
Shi Qiandu's death?

291
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,210
The Soul Cleanse?

292
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,780
Could Shi Qianlv be behind all this?

293
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,260
Did he cleanse the souls of the people here?

294
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,780
The cold energy Tingyan suddenly emitted mostly came

295
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,420
from the food at the banquet.

296
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,970
That's when I started suspecting

297
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,010
something strange about this place.

298
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,620
This duck meat is delicious

299
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,620
and seems very nourishing.

300
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,820
It feels like it's restoring my energy.

301
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,100
Ever since I entered Grain Rain Vale,

302
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,770
my body has grown increasingly uncomfortable.

303
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,420
It must be

304
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,730
the cold energy from Tingyan's anklet affecting me.

305
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,490
To manipulate your cold constitution so strongly,

306
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,820
while simultaneously spreading demonic corruption

307
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,140
to all the plants and creatures here,

308
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,380
there's only one place in the entire Demon Realm

309
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,530
capable of that.

310
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,940
What is all of this?

311
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,970
Where are we?

312
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,860
Who are you?

313
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,820
Alas, we've been found out.

314
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,580
Who are you?

315
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,530
Shi Qianlv's Soul Cleanse is truly formidable.

316
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,970
You've even forgotten your own master.

317
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,380
Mr. Ghost.

318
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,210
We never came

319
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,620
to Grain Rain Vale.

320
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,530
This is actually the Demon Realm's core,

321
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,250
White Bone Abyss.

322
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,620
So everything here has been a lie.

323
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,340
Who could have

324
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,900
plotted so meticulously

325
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,010
to trick us here?

326
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,340
No one else but the Demon Lord and Mingli

327
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,250
could wield such power

328
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,970
in White Bone Abyss.

329
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,420
Preceptor, Sima Jiao is not to be underestimated.

330
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,820
This Grain Rain Vale

331
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,490
is a flawless illusion

332
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,770
we created together

333
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,690
using Shi Qianlv's Soul Cleanse.

334
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,730
Even so, he has seen through it now.

335
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,900
No matter.

336
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,940
Since we've lured Sima Jiao and Liao Tingyan

337
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,940
into White Bone Abyss,

338
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,490
everything is under our control.

339
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,580
Precisely.

340
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,250
That Frost Fish still wears the defensive anklet

341
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,250
made from his heart-protecting bone.

342
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,100
They certainly wouldn't expect your two-birds-one-stone strategy.

343
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,690
The Frost Fish's defensive anklet

344
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,180
channels cold energy that backlashes onto Sima Jiao,

345
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,010
severely restricting his cultivation.

346
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,770
If the Frost Fish removes the anklet

347
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,290
to save Sima Jiao,

348
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,210
it will give us an opening

349
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,340
to capture her.

350
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,210
Right now, the priority

351
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,210
is to bring Liao Tingyan here to refine the froststone.

352
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,340
Then we can kill Sima Jiao and take his blood in one strike.

353
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,530
What's wrong?

354
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,140
Grandmaster, are you all right?

355
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,490
I'm fine.

356
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,770
Mingli's people

357
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,250
will be here soon.

358
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,050
You should leave with Nianjiu first.

359
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,420
The Demon Realm will unleash their full strength against you.

360
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,010
You can't take on all of them alone.

361
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,530
I'll go get Hongluo. Nianjiu will go with you.

362
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,530
I'm stronger than before.

363
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,380
Don't underestimate me.

364
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,450
Besides, I still have the anklet you gave me.

365
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,100
I'll be fine.

366
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,860
All right.

367
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,900
Wait for me.

368
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,970
Sima Jiao,

369
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,900
how have you been recovering at Grain Rain Vale?

370
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,340
Cut the chatter.

371
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,860
Hongluo!

372
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,770
Hongluo!

373
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,970
Hongluo!

374
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,860
Hongluo!

375
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,690
Grandmaster.

376
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,690
Tingyan's cold energy can,

377
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,530
through the defensive anklet made from your heart-protecting bone,

378
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,940
retaliate against your cultivation

379
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,690
and limit your powers.

380
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,450
Hongluo!

381
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,340
Hongluo!

382
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,860
Yan!

383
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,050
Yan.

384
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,010
Something's wrong here. Are you all right?

385
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,250
Was all of this part of your plan?

386
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,250
What do you mean? I'm just worried about you.

387
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,530
Did you collude with the Demon Realm and Shi Qianlv

388
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,050
to lure me into this Grain Rain Vale illusion?

389
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,820
What's your goal?

390
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,530
I have no intention to harm you.

391
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,820
I only want to awaken the memories between us.

392
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,690
I told you, I'm not your Frost Fish.

393
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,690
Yan, I can explain!

394
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,050
This concerns Sima Jiao's safety.

395
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,250
Don't you want to know?

396
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,580
What's wrong with Sima Jiao?

397
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,530
Perhaps you noticed

398
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,660
Sima Jiao's cultivation weakening and his body acting strangely

399
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,010
since arriving here.

400
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,900
It's related to the artifact on your foot.

401
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,420
Impossible.

402
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,380
He forged this defensive artifact for me.

403
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,970
It can block all harm.

404
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,730
You should know

405
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,490
this artifact is made from his heart-protecting bone.

406
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,140
It shields you from damage, which doesn't hurt him,

407
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,380
but your cold energy clashes

408
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,940
with his.

409
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,450
The White Bone Abyss triggers your cold energy.

410
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,180
It makes you uncomfortable,

411
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,660
but since you're a Frost Fish,

412
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,490
it won't actually harm you.

413
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,250
Yet your accumulating cold energy

414
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,690
backlashes onto his body

415
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,450
through your anklet.

416
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,900
What's wrong?

417
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,860
Grandmaster, are you all right?

418
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,290
I'm fine.

419
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,340
Yan, you'd risk yourself

420
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,620
for him?

421
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,660
Who's there?

422
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,100
Grandmaster. Nianjiu.

423
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,770
Hongluo, what are you doing here?

424
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,900
Where's Tingyan?

425
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,770
Wasn't she with you?

426
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,860
This isn't good.

427
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,210
This is bad.

428
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,580
She removed the defensive anklet.

429
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,770
Nianjiu, get Hongluo out of here first.

430
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,010
Hongluo, I'll get you out

431
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,940
and return to help him.

432
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,580
All right.

433
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,380
Yan.

434
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,580
Father.

435
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,420
Your leg...

436
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,580
So even your injury was a lie.

437
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,970
You manipulated my guilt

438
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,140
to make me your tool for revenge.

439
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,340
You've disappointed me.

440
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,530
Qiandu was right.

441
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,140
Raising you was a waste of time.

442
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,180
If I meant anything to you

443
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,420
as your daughter,

444
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,690
you wouldn't have done this to me.

445
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,580
You were behind the Grain Rain Vale illusion too,

446
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,770
weren't you?

447
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,380
Yan, I devoted my life's learning

448
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,420
to you.

449
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,770
But it still couldn't match Sima Jiao's skill

450
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,340
in swaying hearts.

451
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:41,900
So be it.

452
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,940
Feng Qi.

453
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,250
Yan, please believe me.

454
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,660
I would never harm you.

455
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,380
Are you really going to choose his side?

456
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,770
I don't care about your past.

457
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,010
I just want her memories restored.

458
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,530
Do not hurt her.

459
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,490
Leave her to me.

460
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,940
Preceptor and I still need her

461
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,620
to fight Sima Jiao.

462
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,580
Rest assured, Mr. Feng.

463
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,180
The best way to recover her memories

464
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,140
is to send her to the Guiyuan Chamber deep within White Bone Abyss.

465
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,420
That's where the cold energy is strongest.

466
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,250
It will awaken her cold constitution.

467
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,420
When she returns,

468
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,900
you'll have the Frost Fish

469
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,290
who's recovered everything.

470
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,180
But Sima Jiao is incredibly difficult to deal with.

471
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,900
He watches Yan every moment

472
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,770
without letting her out of his sight.

473
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,860
What if Sima Jiao is actually willing

474
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,940
to bring her here?

475
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,010
What do you mean?

476
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,730
Shi Yan's father told me

477
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,180
she's always dreamed of Grain Rain Vale,

478
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,420
a sanctuary revered in the Demon Realm.

479
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,290
Why don't we embellish it

480
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,210
and create a Grain Rain Vale illusion for her?

481
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,420
How could that be possible?

482
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,340
You don't need to worry about that.

483
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,380
Just bring

484
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,860
your Frost Fish there.

485
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,820
Yan, I'm sorry. I lied to you.

486
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,730
You're not truly yourself right now.

487
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,290
When you regain your Frost Fish memories,

488
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,900
you'll understand why I did what I did.

489

[Blood Sacrifice Chamber, White Bone Abyss]

490
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,090
Is that General Chang Zhi

491
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,020
standing next to the Preceptor?

492
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,300
No, that's Feng Qi, the orphaned son of General Chang Zhi.

493
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,820
Mingli.

494
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,930
You, as Preceptor,

495
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,610
dare to betray your lord?

496
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,370
I'm loyal to the former Demon Lord. I don't consider this a betrayal.

497
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,890
You want to use my blood

498
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,930
to resurrect that old beast?

499
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,300
Insolence!

500
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,700
Subjects of the Demon Realm, welcome the return of the former Demon Lord.

501
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,930
Welcome the return of the former Demon Lord.

502
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,260
What a joke.

503
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,780
You think

504
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,020
your words alone make it true?

505
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,570
Is this how the descendants

506
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,740
of the You family behave? Arrogant and useless?

507
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,370
Old fool! I'm still the Lord of the Demon Realm!

508
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,300
How dare you disrespect me...

509
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,130
Not willing to surrender your demonic body to me?

510
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,260
But as a descendant of the You family,

511
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,500
this is your fate.

512
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,570
Your demonic soul has been

513
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,610
in this body long enough.

514
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,460
Too long to matter anymore.

515
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,170
How's the progress on the Xingtian Chain?

Speak.

The froststone is still undergoing intensive refinement.

519

Soon it will let us kill Sima Jiao in one strike.

520

has now become rebellious because of Sima Jiao.

525
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,930
Sect Master Shi, thanks to your help,

526
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,370
we've succeeded.

527
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,780
I had asked you to rest earlier,

528
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,410
but you insisted on guarding the Guiyuan Chamber.

529
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,610
Preceptor, whether the Xingtian Chain succeeds

530
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,700
is crucial for our revenge plan.

531
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,610
There mustn't be a single slip-up.

532
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,410
Are you driven by revenge,

533
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,570
or can't you bear to see your fake daughter suffer?

534
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,820
You're overthinking.

00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,370
I excel at marrow cleansing

00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,650
You're too late.

558
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,370
By now, she's probably been refined

559
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,260
into froststone.

560
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,330
I'll use it to kill you soon.

561
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,410
It will be complete any moment now!

562
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,020
I won't let that happen!

563
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:41,930
Tingyan!

564
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,260
Sect Master Shi!

565
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,220
How much longer until the Xingtian Chain is ready?

566
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,140
It's been a while, Grandmaster.

567
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,140
I've let you live too long.

568
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,850
I'm glad I raised a good daughter.

569
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,260
Given your current relationship,

570
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,970
shouldn't you be addressing me as Father?

571
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,140
The froststone isn't fully refined yet.

572
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,580
Coming here armed with that pathetic relic,

573
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,660
you're asking for your own demise!

574
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,180

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,100
I'm ignorant enough to survive over a thousand years

without realizing this?

597
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,820
Sima Jiao, I know you're stalling here

598
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,930
to buy time for Liao Tingyan's escape.

599
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,530
But even if she escapes the Guiyuan Chamber,

600
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,490
can she escape her fate?

601
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,850
Her destiny ceased to be yours to control

602
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,660
the moment she met me.

603
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,330
Ceased to be ours to control?

604
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,820
If it's not ours to decide,

605
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,100
then is it yours?

606

607
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,930
is hers alone to decide.

612
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,330
Sima Jiao, don't you see?

Anyone close to you

614
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,970
can't control their own fate.

Your birth

616
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,930
and the existence of the Fengshan Clan

617
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,700
are all but a joke.
