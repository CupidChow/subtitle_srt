[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,460
[Episode 24]
[That Brave Girl Who Dated the Big Boss Was Actually Me?!]

22
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,810
Why would

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,780
such a memory appear in your Soul Manor?

24
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,220
Could it really be, as Sima Jiao said,

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,700
that you are Liao Tingyan

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,220
but have only lost that part of your memory?

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,010
That is exactly what baffles me.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,890
If what I saw in my Soul Manor was true,

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,890
then my aunt's memories were false.

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,980
Besides, if Sima Jiao had something to hide,

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,890
he wouldn't have insisted on taking me to search for my aunt's soul.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,180
So you suspect your father has been lying to you all along?

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500
I don't want to think that way.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,020
But all the signs point to it.

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,220
Father once saved my life.

36
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,060
That actually happened.

37
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,620
And we've lived together for 18 years.

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,740
I really don't want to believe he'd lie to me.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,020
Can you try to enter your Soul Manor again

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,620
to find out what really happened back then?

41
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,530
I've tried,

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,810
but my cultivation is too low. I can't get in.

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,810
So

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,900
what do you plan to do next?

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,740
I want to find out the truth.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,060
If so...

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,180
It's me.

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,780
Hongluo.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,180
Thank you, Si...

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,090
Thank you, sir, for transferring my soul and giving me rebirth.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,460
Seeing you up close,

52
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,740
you truly are a handsome man with a delicate and pretty face.

53
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,780
Hongluo,

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,740
why are you being so glib?

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,130
That's typical Miss Hongluo, isn't it?

56
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,460
You're here, too?

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,370
Of course, to celebrate

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,570
Miss Hongluo's return.

59
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,020
Save your flattery.

60
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,850
Didn't expect we'd reunite in a new place.

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,060
Talk about perfect timing. The three of us will gather tonight as usual.

62
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,740
We'll sing and play games as we used to do.

63
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,970
We must drink till we drop.

64
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,900
Hongluo is still a kid. She can't drink.

65
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,250
True. Let's have tea, then.

66
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,500
I can drink liquor.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,340
Here you go.

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,370
Ah, there's a lovers' rivalry going on here.

69
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,060
What are you talking about?

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,940
She's out of her mind.

71
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,500
One is the celestial Grandmaster

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,540
you swore a lifelong vow to,

73
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,250
the other is your childhood friend

74
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,770
you've shared 18 years of ups and downs with.

75
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,770
What a hard choice to make.

76
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,330
Are those lifelong vows

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,940
already gone,

78
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,370
or did they never exist?

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,100
Is there even a trace of this memory

80
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,810
in Yan's heart?

81
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,250
That makes sense.

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,980
Well, enough of that.

83
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,450
Let's have tea instead of liquor

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,570
to celebrate Hongluo's return.

85
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,810
Cheers.

86
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,740
By your order,

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,860
I've prepared some pills

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,100
that could help Senior Tingyan restore her cultivation.

89
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,370
It's too bitter.

90
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,890
Grandmaster, good medicine is always bitter.

91
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,370
She'll understand.

92
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,860
Redo them.

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,940
But Grandmaster,

94
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,370
that means taking your blood again.

95
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,810
Your blood is so precious.

96
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,860
Isn't that wasteful?

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,690
I'll do my best.

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,570
My lord,

99
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,690
our men searched the entire city,

100
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,660
but there's no sign of Shi Qianlv.

101
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,300
Then search the other cities.

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,010
Leave no stone unturned.

103
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,770
Drag that scoundrel out at all costs.

104
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,620
Yes, my lord.

105
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,540
Hongluo has returned safely.

106
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,450
Ruling,

107
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,450
wait for me.

108
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,500
Come, let's move.

109
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,660
Eat more. It's good for your health.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,330
I've never had this in the Celestial Crane City before.

111
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,620
If paired with Rouge Terrace's homemade brew,

112
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,300
it'd be perfect.

113
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,210
You're a kid. You can't drink.

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,860
But honestly, everything Sima Jiao prepared here

115
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,010
suits my taste.

116
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,010
I almost mistook you for Sima Jiao

117
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,130
when you dressed like this.

118
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,130
I mean,

119
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,810
you're just as dashing as him.

120
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,690
Am I making it worse?

121
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,210
It's fine.

122
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,980
I know you're trying to compliment me.

123
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,540
Always running your mouth.

124
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,450
Yan.

125
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,540
What do you want to eat, Yan?

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,420
I'll make it for you.

127
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,420
We have a full table here.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,770
Those coarse flatbreads you made in the Celestial Crane City,

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,370
honestly, Yan doesn't like them.

130
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,060
She only ate them to fill her hunger.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,620
When it comes to food,

132
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,860
Sima Jiao knows Yan's taste better than you.

133
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,100
That's nonsense.

134
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,210
Hongluo, you know

135
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,740
Feng Qi dislikes Sima Jiao,

136
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,940
but keep provoking him.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,890
It's fun, though.

138
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,370
Yan,

139
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,540
I can cook a lot of things

140
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,620
like sliced knuckle in brown sauce, ice cream, and pastries.

141
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,890
Name anything.

142
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,770
Really?

143
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,210
If you have such skills,

144
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,540
it's a shame to serve as a guard in Rouge Terrace.

145
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,890
My mother said

146
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,100
even the best cooking

147
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,740
loses its charm

148
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,940
if used for business.

149
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,660
Your mother mustn't have been an ordinary person, right?

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,610
The food you mentioned

151
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,690
isn't even seen in the Demon Realm,

152
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,260
let alone tasted.

153
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,180
Right.

154
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,450
Are you actually from a noble family?

155
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,090
I wish I were.

156
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,940
Then I wouldn't need to struggle to scrape by.

157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,540
True.

158
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,020
If I were noble,

159
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,210
with ample wealth and leisure,

160
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,330
I'd have lived in seclusion long ago,

161
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,260
far from these troubles.

162
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,330
Where would you hide?

163
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,900
That's a secret between Yan and me.

164
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,210
Yan,

165
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,780
do you still want to go to Grain Rain Vale?

166
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,810
I must uncover the truth first.

167
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,180
You scared me.

168
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,850
Why are you two here?

169
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,660
I came out to find my father.

170
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,210
Once I know the truth, I'll come back.

171
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,540
Why should we stay here

172
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,690
when you've already left?

173
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,850
What matters now is how we leave.

174
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,850
I say we fly out using spells.

175
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,450
No.

176
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,020
Sima Jiao is strong.

177
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,180
If he senses our energy, we're doomed.

178
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,260
Then how do you think

179
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,540
we can avoid those guards?

180
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,020
Try a doghole.

181
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,730
I'm not crawling through that.

182
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,060
They sure have the guts to slack off

183
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,900
under the Grandmaster's rule.

184
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,570
Heaven is on our side.

185
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,570
Let's go.

186
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,540
Move.

187
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,380
Quick.

188
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,970
Feng Qi has taken the Frost Fish away

189
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,970
from Sima Jiao?

190
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,660
Yes.

191
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,300
Our men have been watching

192
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,850
his every move.

193
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,810
They saw Feng Qi take Shi Yan

194
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,900
and a child

195
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,450
into Zhenshi Inn.

196
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,660
Make the arrangements now.

197
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,660
This is the perfect time to act.

198
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,660
Yes, Preceptor.

199
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,020
Did Sima Jiao know we've escaped?

200
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,610
Is he upset or furious?

201
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,210
Forget it.

202
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,330
I can't even figure out my own affairs.

203
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,420
Why worry about him?

204
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,260
Grandmaster,

205
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,940
I've refined the cleansing pills for Ms. Yan.

206
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,730
They're all sweet.

207
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,020
But now that she's gone,

208
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,490
how will we give them to her?

209
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,260
You're dismissed.

210
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,810
Yes, Grandmaster.

211
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,570
Who sent you?

212
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,810
Preceptor.

213
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,660
Why take her?

214
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,970
I don't know.

215
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,850
Does Feng Qi know of this?

216
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,850
No.

217
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,850
Why did the Preceptor of the Demon Realm need Tingyan?

218
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,610
Why did I sleep so deeply yesterday?

219
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,810
Because someone cast a fainting spell on you.

220
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,060
Bi'an?

221
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,970
Why am I back here?

222
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,690
What do you mean?

223
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,570
The innkeeper of Zhenshi Inn

224
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,940
tampered with the incense in your room,

225
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,780
attempting to abduct you all in your sleep.

226
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,490
Fortunately, Grandmaster arrived in time.

227
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,970
Where are Hongluo and Feng Qi?

228
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,260
Don't worry, Ms. Yan.

229
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,810
Grandmaster knows you care about them.

230
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,690
He rescued them as well.

231
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,660
Ms. Yan, you worry about everyone else,

232
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,420
but not about Grandmaster.

233
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,420
I feel bad for him.

234
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,780
I'm confused about what's real

235
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,900
and what's false,

236
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,540
and I don't know how to face him either.

237
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,570
Forget about those.

238
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,780
True feelings can't be faked, can they?

239
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,780
Ms. Yan, look at this.

240
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,210
These are the cleansing pills

241
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,900
Grandmaster made for you

242
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,210
with his own blood.

243
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,940
They help raise your cultivation

244
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,610
and enhance your health.

245
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,420
Sima Jiao must know

246
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,900
that if my cultivation grows stronger,

247
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,900
I can enter the Soul Manor to find out the truth of the past.

248
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,970
Is he not afraid I'll find it out?

249
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,490
If what he said is real,

250
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,210
doesn't that mean my father was lying?

251
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,420
Has my entire life

252
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,260
been nothing but a lie?

253
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,900
Liao Tingyan is wearing

254
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,210
such a powerful defensive artifact?

255
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,730
Indeed.

256
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,450
It contains Sima Jiao's spiritual power.

257
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,940
I believe

258
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,900
Sima Jiao fused his heart-protecting bone

259
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,050
into it.

260
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,010
Preceptor,

261
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,450
if she keeps that,

262
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,730
then even if

263
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,970
Feng Qi brings her to us,

264
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,420
we can't do anything.

265
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,290
Such an artifact can't simply be taken by force.

266
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,530
We must think of a way

267
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,140
to make her remove the anklet herself.

268
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,420
Have you found anything

269
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,380
about Shi Qianlv?

270
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,250
Yes, Preceptor.

271
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,970
We discovered that Shi Qianlv once used

272
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,010
the Soul Cleanse on his own sister

273
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,210
and sent her to Sima Jiao

274
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,010
trying to create a misunderstanding,

275
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,530
but to no avail.

276
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,940
Soul Cleanse?

277
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,050
I didn't expect him to be skilled in this secret art.

278
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,420
Where is he now?

279
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,340
He's hiding in a remote house,

280
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,860
barely surviving.

281
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,010
It's time to put Shi Qianlv to use.

282
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,180
Since Qiandu's soul has been searched,

283
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,730
why has Sima Jiao made no move?

284
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,940
Seems like Liao Tingyan hasn't acted yet.

285
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,490
Useless fool.

286
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,100
Is the Shi family

287
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,660
going to ruin?

288
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,380
Sect Master Shi,

289
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,530
please come with us.

290
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,210
I knew you'd come.

291
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,450
Sect Master Shi, you remain so composed even in hardship.

292
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,380
You truly take after your master, the Lord of Slack,

293
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,530
calm and clear-minded.

294
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,250
Calm and clear-minded?

295
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,770
What use is that?

296
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,770
I'm still ruined at the hands

297
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,230
of the former Demon Lord.

298
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,210
Forgive me, Sect Master Shi.

299
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,620
I only managed to invite you

300
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,340
to my residence now.

301
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,450
You must've suffered in the mountains.

302
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,730
No need to apologize.

303
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,530
Just speak plainly.

304
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,620
I heard you practice a secret spell,

305
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,180
the Soul Cleanse.

306
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,860
I need you

307
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,380
to lure your daughter, Shi Yan, out.

308
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,100
With the help of this secret spell,

309
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,820
we could cut Sima Jiao down in one strike.

310
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,770
You wish to use her against Sima Jiao as well?

311
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,620
Perhaps you've heard

312
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,770
I once tried this art on my sister

313
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,620
to drive the two apart,

314
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,580
but

315
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,730
I failed.

316
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,210
The situation is different now.

317
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,420
This time, with the aid of the Demon Realm,

318
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,900
things will surely turn out differently.

319
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,580
By then, you can avenge your grievances,

320
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,180
and the Demon Realm will help you rebuild your sect.

321
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,140
Preceptor,

322
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,730
it's not hard

323
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,730
to lure her out.

324
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,210
But there must be a bait.

325
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,620
Good.

326
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,380
I already have someone

327
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,210
in mind.

328
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,050
Grandmaster,

329
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,860
Ms. Yan has accepted those pills.

330
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,210
Did you say anything to her?

331
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,530
No.

332
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,340
Sima Jiao.

333
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,100
Do you mean to confine Yan for life?

334
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,340
Do you think that's how you could win her heart?

335
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,770
All you can think about

336
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,490
is how to win her heart.

337
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,180
No wonder you're being used without even knowing it.

338
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,050
What do you mean?

339
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,490
That Zhenshi Inn you stayed at

340
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,620
was a trap.

341
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,690
Someone wanted to abduct Ms. Yan

342
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,490
in her sleep.

343
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,140
Fortunately, Grandmaster rescued Ms. Yan,

344
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,180
so she's safe.

345
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,380
Yet you still haven't realized where the problem is.

346
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,050
Whoever harms her,

347
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,770
I'll kill them.

348
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,050
Entering the Soul Manor

349
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,770
is the only way to find out what happened back then.

350
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,250
That also prevents Sima Jiao from losing too much blood.

351
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,180
I made it.

352
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,620
Where should I begin?

353
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,690
I'll take time to learn about the rest.

354
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,580
Show me the past with my brother.

355
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,180
Sima Jiao,

356
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,490
you're despicable.

357
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,100
You actually let this demon wench kill me!

358
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,970
You think you two can stay together forever?

359
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,450
You're courting death.

360
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,730
Your love bond will be severed by the way of heaven!

361
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,290
No!

362
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,380
No, I don't want.

363
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,820
No.

364
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,050
No, I...

365
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,380
Aunt's memory doesn't match mine at all.

366
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,010
Was I the one who killed Zhenxu?

367
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,100
And the way he insults me

368
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,940
doesn't sound like family,

369
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,010
more like an enemy.

370
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,820
So the truth I've believed all along

371
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,100
was twisted.

372
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,940
I was never part of the Shi family.

373
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,580
That so-called father conspired

374
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,010
with Aunt to deceive me,

375
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,770
so they could use me against Sima Jiao.

376
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,050
Even Shi Qiandu's death

377
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,530
might have been part of their scheme.

378
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,010
Is this also a part of my Soul Manor?

379
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,420
Feels like it hides some great secret.

380
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,860
Fried chicken!

381
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,180
Then this must be my Soul Manor.

382
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,340
[Liao Tingyan]
Sima Jiao. Huge jerk. Scum.

383
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,690
No way!

384
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,290
The one who dated Sima Jiao

385
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,210
was actually me.

386
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,050
It can't be.

387
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,050
It's come to this crazy point?

388
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,940
Was I seriously thinking about proposing to him?

389
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,100
Did I really

390
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,620
love him more than he loved me?

391
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,450
What are you looking at?

392
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,420
Why are you so nervous?

393
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,820
Anything wrong with these two rings?

394
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,820
Nothing.

395
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,770
Wait.

396
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,180
Why are you here?

397
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,210
I came to find you.

398
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,690
I noticed you look absent-minded.

399
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,770
I fear the pills may leave ill effects on you,

400
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,210
causing you to lose your way,

401
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,530
so I came.

402
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,210
How can you say that as if it were only natural?

403
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,690
Go out.

404
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,100
Looks like this is a gift for me,

405
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,530
right?

406
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,770
How did you know?

407
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,140
Because it fits me perfectly.

408
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,660
You're quick to assume.

409
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,940
See this?

410
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,250
Yes.

411
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,450
I know

412
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,620
you once liked me,

413
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,900
and you still do.

414
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,420
You rely on me,

415
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,290
believe me,

416
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,490
and are willing to stay with me.

417
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,050
Because that's who you are,

418
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,940
so I am.

419
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,770
Just to be clear.

420
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,180
They aren't wedding rings.

421
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,490
They're couple rings.

422
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,660
Couple?

423
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,900
Then,

424
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,100
am I

425
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,530
your boy...

426
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,620
boyfriend now?

427
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,970
Don't rush it.

428
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,620
Let me get used to it first.

429
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,730
Don't you believe me yet?

430
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,940
I do. I do.

431
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,860
Everything in my Soul Manor is solid proof

432
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,180
telling me I'm Liao Tingyan.

From the moment I saw you,

442
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,770
you've been the same.

But if you do,

450
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,900
I won't be surprised.

451
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,580
If you keep teasing me,

452
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,580
I won't be Liao Tingyan anymore.

453
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,380
You arrive on time, Mr. Feng.

454
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,490
Mr. Ghost,

455
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,940
why did you ask for me?

456
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,740
I have a plan to discuss with you.

457
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,300
A plan?

458
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,450
Pardon my bold guess.

459
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,820
What happened in Zhenshi Inn

460
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,740
was your doing, right?

461
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,340
You urged me to bring Yan out

462
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,530
and planted a spy in Zhenshi Inn

463
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,780
beforehand.

464
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,940
The moment we stepped into Zhenshi Inn,

465
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,170
everything was part of your plan.

466
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,900
What exactly do you want with Yan?

467
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,900
You're clever, Mr. Feng.

468
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,610
I'll be honest with you.

469
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:57,940
We only want that Frost Fish to return to her duty.

470
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,220
I wonder if you're willing to work with us.

471
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,220
We help you regain her memory,

472
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,420
and you help us use her to kill Sima Jiao.

473
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,050
It's simple.

474
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,260
Just convince Shi Yan

475
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,300
to remove her defensive anklet.

476
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,050
Pardon me, I refuse.

477
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,010
I take my leave.

478
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,900
Refuse all you like.

479
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,780
When that Frost Fish

480
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,940
has fully turned to Sima Jiao,

481
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,820
I hope you won't regret it.

482
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,900
You!

483
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,650
Preceptor.

484
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,450
Feng Qi refuses

485
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,940
to cooperate with us.

486
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,090
What do we do?

487
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,010
He hesitated just now.

488
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,900
There's still a chance.

489
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,170
Grandmaster.

490
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,130
You're back.

491
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,780
Have you found Shi Qianlv?

492
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,740
Forgive me, Grandmaster.

493
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,130
I couldn't locate him.

494
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,490
We searched the entire Demon Realm,

495
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,530
but there was no sign of him.

496
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,010
However, we found traces of where he once hid

497
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,490
in a remote house,

498
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,940
but that's the last trail we found.

499
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,740
In that case,

500
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,900
someone must be helping him hide.

501
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,170
But the Shi family has lost the people's trust.

502
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,700
Who would still help him?

503
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,260
Those who wish me ill.

504
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,340
Who is so blind?

505
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,450
You're now revered by all the people.

506
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,740
By your order,

507
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,610
I rescued many from the Celestial Palace

508
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,780
along the way.

509
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,650
I've heard countless praises

510
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,610
for your rule over the Demon Realm.

511
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,900
What use are those vanities for?

512
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,450
Do you mean to seek the heart of the very one,

513
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,300
rather than the hearts of all?

514
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,700
Hongluo has revived.

515
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,780
Why are you still standing here?

516
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,420
Thank you, Grandmaster.

517
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,820
I shall take my leave.

518
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,700
In just one night,

519
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,260
I've turned into my old self.

520
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,530
In just one night, enemies became lovers.

521
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,650
Hongluo.

522
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,970
How should I face Sima Jiao?

523
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,420
Treat him as a lover,

524
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,300
or a cultivation partner?

525
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,740
That's too fast.

526
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,780
Haven't you found your identity?

527
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,010
Just go to him.

528
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,050
I don't have memories

529
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,340
of being with him before.

530
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,380
How am I supposed to do that?

531
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,300
Start with dating?

532
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,050
Instead of fretting here,

533
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,700
go see him right now.

534
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,300
But before meeting him,

535
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,340
I suggest you bathe

536
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,340
and change your clothes.

537
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,300
Freshen yourself up

538
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,490
before going.

539
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,860
Ruling.

540
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,010
Ruling.

541
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,560
You're

542
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,620
the black serpent lord?

543
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,130
Ruling, I'm back.

544
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,970
Ruling, I...

545
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,860
Are you trying to say

546
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,650
that I'm the Ruling you once knew?

547
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,220
Yes.

548
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,380
And that I was your lover?

549
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,700
Yes.

550
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,970
If you don't believe me...

551
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,530
I do.

552
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,900
Really?

553
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,570
But...

554
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,570
But?

555
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,090
You're a stranger to me now.

556
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,490
Do you expect me

557
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,090
to resume what we once had?

558
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,260
Then tell me,

559
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,820
that night at Rouge Terrace,

560
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,900
why did you purposely dance in front of me

561
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,900
and later

562
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,300
wait for me in the room?

563
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,130
Because I wanted to absorb your cultivation.

564
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,380
What else could it be?

565
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,340
Forget it.

566
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,420
Let's not bring this up again.

567
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,090
That day is my death anniversary.

568
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,610
Not a good memory.

569
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,940
Ruling,

570
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,090
I'm sorry.

571
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,260
I failed to protect you.

572
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,820
It's not your fault.

573
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,650
We never really knew each other.

574
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,700
Well,

575
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,340
I have nothing more to do

576
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,300
with the Ruling of the past.

577
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,650
So, Lord Hei,

578
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,450
please leave me alone.

579
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,740
There's no way to force someone to love you.

580
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,300
Say,

581
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,090
my name is Hongluo.

582
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,700
Don't get it wrong again.

583
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,340
Isn't this the cold pond?

584
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
