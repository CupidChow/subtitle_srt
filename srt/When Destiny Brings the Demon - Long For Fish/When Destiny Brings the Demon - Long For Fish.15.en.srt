22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,290
Next time, we can host a feast here too.

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,250
All you think about is having fun.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,060
Already forgot what the teacher taught?

25
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,530
Why spoil my good mood?

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,700
Let's go.

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,250
Wait!

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,650
You must be Yong Shiqiu of Night Palace.

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,370
Why rush off?

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,220
Why not stay here with your sister?

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,810
There's more fun to come.

32
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,530
It'd be a pity to miss it.

33
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,220
A feast, huh?

34
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,810
Stop spouting nonsense.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,810
My brother's just straightforward.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,220
Let's meet another day.

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,060
Uh...

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,690
Back so soon?

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,250
I thought you'd be busy out there for days.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,130
What, don't want to see me?

41
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,620
No way.

42
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,690
Do you like it here?

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,900
It's okay.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,090
The food's better than at the academy.

45
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,020
Shame I was too busy entertaining them.

46
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,220
Didn't get to enjoy it.

47
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,500
With your cultivation now,

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,650
you don't need this stuff at all.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,530
Other than filling your stomach,

50
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,340
it's useless.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,650
I eat simply because I'm greedy.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,530
I really can't understand the pleasure

53
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,250
of indulging in food.

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,250
If someone can't sleep well

55
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,220
or savor good food,

56
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,250
his life must lose a lot of joy.

57
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,900
I suggest you try more good food.

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,130
It really helps keep you happy.

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,020
Where are we going?

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,090
So you brought me here for a private feast!

61
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,340
Those people never stop talking.

62
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,690
And you barely ate either, right?

63
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,340
You know me too well!

64
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,220
I'll eat...

65
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,300
Go on, eat.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,220
The custard's silky smooth, and melts in your mouth.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,530
That faint touch of mushroom

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,650
brings the flavor to its peak.

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,900
A taste so divine!

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,540
What's with you?

71
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,450
You've got food in front of you,

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,660
yet you insist on taking mine.

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,500
I take whatever I want.

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,860
Crisp and springy!

75
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,810
What's so great about this stuff?

76
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,690
Annoying pest.

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,130
I'd love to dump the whole plate on his head!

78
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,330
You heard that?

79
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,370
Heard what?

80
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,740
Sima Jiao,

81
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,570
tell me the truth.

82
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,450
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

83
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,300
Say something.

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,500
You can hear my thoughts, can't you?

85
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,330
Liar!

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,100
Didn't you say you can't read minds?

87
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,940
I really can't.

88
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,330
But lately, when your emotions run wild,

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,800
I sometimes hear what's on your mind.

90
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,570
Only yours.

91
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,330
No need to be that precise.

92
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
Why just mine?

93
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,140
Abilities shift with circumstances.

94
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,980
It's common in the cultivation world.

95
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,860
Any changes with you?

96
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,660
Don't tell me...

97
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,370
it's because of our soul bond.

98
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,690
So even without the Truth Spell,

99
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,940
you can hear my heart?

100
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,250
Didn't the teacher

101
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,980
explain this back at the academy?

102
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,100
Oh, Liao Tingyan...

103
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,210
Better pay attention

104
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,010
in those cultivation health classes.

105
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,660
All those thoughts of yours...

106
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,100
I can hear them all.

[*Reciting the times table]

108
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,810
Grandmaster, do you catch every thought

109
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,620
in my head when I get worked up?

110
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,370
Not word for word that clear.

111
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,420
But if you start cursing someone,

112
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,740
I'll know.

113
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,450
So I'd suggest you stay calm.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,620
You've got some nerve saying that!

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,940
You're the one who keeps losing your temper...

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,300
I've cursed him plenty in my head.

140

143
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,330
please quit speaking

144
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,810
directly into my mind.

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,810
Wait...

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,810
I cursed Sima Jiao like crazy before,

No anger, no killing me.

149
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,490
Could it be true love?

Didn't he hear it?

151
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,570
Did you really not hear it?

152
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,020
I'm resting now. Do as you please.

153
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,940
Stay calm. Don't stir trouble.

154
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,940
I'm already staying calm.

155
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,900

Today's lesson is on the soul and the soul manor.

178
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,610
The soul manor is one's most private place.

179
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,020
It must be guarded well.

180
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,210
If invaded,

181
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,810
it means death or ruin.

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,020
Sir, what about cultivation partners?

183
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,570
Quiet!

184
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,940
Even cultivation partners

185
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,140
don't easily enter each other's soul manor.

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,540
It's extremely dangerous.

187
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,610
If you're truly fortunate to find a partner

188
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,140
who shares life and death with you,

189
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,490
you may attempt it.

190
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,940
But you're still young,

191
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,780
unaware of the dangers.

192
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,900
Don't chase a moment's pleasure

193
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,850
and lose what matters.

194
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,330
Feels like Sima Jiao and I

195
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,610
are problem students sneaking forbidden fruit.

196
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,780
Soul bond is the most intimate bond.

197
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,140
If one dies,

198
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,490
the other often can't survive.

199
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,450
Because the souls are bound too tightly,

200
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,570
the feelings too deep to cut apart.

201
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,300
So never take this lightly.

202
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,020
We haven't even started dating,

203
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,210
and it's straight to life-and-death vows?

204
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,730
Is it still time for Sima Jiao and me

205
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,490
to switch to separate beds?

206
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,540
No, wait.

207
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,300
It's one thing if I didn't know.

208
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,490
But how could Sima Jiao not know?

209
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,210
Could it be...

210
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,180
he's already seen me

211
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,260
as his other half?

212
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,090
Tingyan.

213
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,690
I won't be here tonight.

214
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,260
Then be careful out there.

215
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,020
Want me to bring you something?

216
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,730
Why ask like that?

217
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,060
I'm heading out.

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,020
If you want anything, I'll bring it back.

219
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,380
Coming home with gifts sounds just like a married couple.

220
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,180
Anything's fine. I'm not picky.

221
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,660
All right, wait for me.

222
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,900
I won't keep you waiting long.

223
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,140
Why's he being so gentle?

224
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,330
Is he really taking me as his cultivation partner?

225
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,060
Sect Master Shi, why summon me?

226
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,380
Have you tracked down Sima Jiao?

227
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,660
Madam Ye.

228
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,060
Please, sit.

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,690
Lately,

230
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,780
my clan has faced repeated attacks.

231
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,690
I sent people to investigate.

232
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,060
However,

233
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,450
we found no clues

234
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,730
linked to Sima Jiao.

235
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,940
So,

236
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,730
could you help look into this?

237
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,660
No need to beat around the bush.

238
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,450
Right outside your hall,

239
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,020
my disciple found something interesting.

240
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,380
A scale from Nianjiu!

241
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,850
So you set spies on me.

242
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,780
How is that spying?

243
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,490
We're allies.

244
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,810
Allies should care for one another.

245
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,420
But it seems this ally of mine

246
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,090
is keeping secrets.

247
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,140
The black serpent is indeed in my hall.

248
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,260
But he knows nothing of Sima Jiao's whereabouts.

249
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,140
Truly nothing?

250
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,660
Yes.

251
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,380
But is he honest with you or not?

252
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,970
We can test and see.

253
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,390
He's the only being

254
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,950
who stays by Sima Jiao's side.

255
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,230
So tell me,

256
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,970
if this black serpent is in danger,

257
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,780
won't Sima Jiao step in to save him?

258
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,810
You want me to harm the serpent?

259
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,810
You can't bear to?

260
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,900
You're back.

261
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,090
I'm back.

262
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,690
What's that in your hands?

263
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,820
Well,

264
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,690
I found it in a treasure vault.

265
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,210
It looked good,

266
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,820
so I brought it back for you.

267
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,140
This isn't just an ordinary mirror, is it?

268
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,690
How do you use it?

269
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,290
If you infuse it

270
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,250
with spiritual power,

271
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,900
the two mirrors can reflect each other

272
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,180
even from thousands of miles away.

273
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,490
Shame the picture's not as clear as a cell phone.

274
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,450
What?

275
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,140
Nothing.

276
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,250
I like it.

277
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,900
Liar. If you don't like it, I'll break it.

278
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,420
What are you doing? I said I like it!

279
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,290
Give it back.

280
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,530
You went out of your way to bring me this gift.

281
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,660
So hand it over!

282
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,730
Then how are you going

283
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,140

your thank-you gift?

289
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,810
Let me be clear...

290
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,810
This is not thanks.

291
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,140

It means two people share one heart,

295
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,860

What is it?

In your words here,

300
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,580
it would be...

Liao Tingyan, stop it!

320
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,490
So even this short-tempered Grandmaster

321
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,820
can be as soft as a kitten.

322
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,490
Hey, my mirror!

323
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,180
If only there are more of these mirrors.

324
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,340
We can place them everywhere,

325
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,820
and gather all the images

326
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,210
onto one.

327
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,690
That will be livestreaming!

328
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,420
Livestreaming?

329
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,050
What's...

330
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,380
livestreaming?

331
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,210
It means

332
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,620
you can watch everything happening in real time.

333
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,530
For example,

334
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,140
put a mirror

335
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,770
in the square of Gengchen Celestial Palace,

336
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,860
we'll see disciples dueling.

337
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,340
Put one in a busy marketplace,

338
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,250
we'll see the bustle of mortal life.

339
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,620
Even in the forests and mountains,

340
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,580
among flowers and trees,

341
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,970
we'll get a nature documentary.

342
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,100
Won't that be wonderful?

343
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,620
Sounds pretty good.

344
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,580
From now on, if you hear a sound from it,

345
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,420
just channel spiritual power and tap the mirror.

346
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,690
Then I'll see whatever I want?

347
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,210
Today,

348
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,620
I'll discuss the Spirit Fire of Fengshan.

349
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,940
Spirit Fire is the foundation of Gengchen Celestial Palace,

350
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,770
nurturing its entire spiritual veins.

351
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,450
Without it,

352
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,770
the Celestial Palace lands will lose all spiritual energy,

353
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,450
turning into a barren waste.

354
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,970
Even its fortune will wither.

355
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,820
The Sima clan sustains the Spirit Fire with their blood.

356
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,210
They've safeguarded the Celestial Palace's prosperity,

357
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,900
and in return gained

358
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,250
abilities beyond ordinary cultivators.

359
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,690
Several of them even ascended to godhood...

360
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,450
Sima Jiao!

361
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,620
It's me.

362
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,100
Why that look?

363
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,690
I just never thought

364
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,420
I'd be using video calls here.

365
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,380
Video...?

366
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,490
What's a video call?

367
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,860
It's when we're in different places,

368
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,450
but can still see each other

369
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,050
and hear each other talk.

370
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,530
So Demon Realm also has Transvision Mirrors?

371
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,530
You can say that.

372
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,100
But we don't call it Transvision Mirror.

373
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,860
We call it a cell phone.

374
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,770
You're amazing.

375
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,580
I casually mentioned livestreaming,

376
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,770
and you made it real.

377
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,340
With this mirror,

378
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,940
I can remind you...

379
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,290
I'm always there for you.

380
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,730
If you want me to miss you, just say so.

381
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,050
No need to dress it up like that.

382
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,900
Forget Sima Jiao.

383
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,660
You're more like Sima Proud-Heart.

384
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,940
You said you wanted livestreaming,

385
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,660
so I visited Three Saints Mountain.

386
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,210
Oh, the tower and palaces are being rebuilt!

387
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,380
Doesn't your invisibility have a time limit?

388
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,510
Be careful. Don't get caught.

389
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,820
Don't worry. I'm hidden by illusions.

390
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,580
I know what I'm doing.

391
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,620
Good, then.

392
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,180
Hold it higher! Higher!

393
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,250
I can't see what's there.

394
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,380
Sima Jiao?

395
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,490
Hello?

396
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,050
Hello?

397
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,620
Don't tell me the mirror's lost signal.

398
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,420
Search here for traces of the Spirit Fire.

399
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,900
Report at once if you find anything.

400
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,290
Hello?

401
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,100
Why's the picture frozen?

402
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,250
I nearly got caught by the teacher.

403
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,580
This place is like that.

404
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,860
Nothing alive here.

405
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,580
You're looking for the Spirit Fire?

406
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,690
Find anything?

407
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,620
Not yet.

408
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,820
Forget about it.

409
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,900
If you like, just enjoy the scenery.

410
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,180
Good thing I was raised on Grandmaster's blood.

411
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,940
I know his aura well.

412
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,620
Maybe I can find him and Tingyan soon.

413
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,450
Ruling?

414
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,340
Ruling's calling me.

415
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,380
Ruling!

416
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,490
Ruling!

417
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,970
Ruling,

418
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,530
why call me back in such a rush?

419
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,420
Did you run into trouble?

420
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,660
Or did someone bully you?

421
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,340
Nianjiu, I had no choice.

422
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,730
Please forgive me.

423
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,340
Ruling, you called me back

424
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,900
just for this?

425
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,380
Ruling,

426
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,050
why betray Grandmaster?

427
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,490
Sima Jiao has killed countless. He deserves to die.

428
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,730
This isn't betrayal. It's justice!

429
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,380
Ruling, tell me...

430
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,660
have they deceived you?

431
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,970
Grandmaster is not that kind of man.

432
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,580
Silence!

433
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,380
Do you realize

434
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,100
I can kill you right here?

435
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,820
I'm just a serpent by nature.

436
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,420
You gave me the chance to take human form.

437
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,580
This life is yours to begin with.

438
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,900
If you want it back today,

439
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,860
then take it.

440
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,730
I know this hurts you.

441
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,900
But bear it for now.

442
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,340
Word has spread

443
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,420
that you're imprisoned.

444
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,010
I'm sure

445
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,100
Sima Jiao will come for you once he knows.

446
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,050
There's someone spying on us.

447
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,660
Bite me, then use Breath-Sealing.

448
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,860
I'll let you escape.

449
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,250
Nianjiu, we were once master and disciple.

450
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,380
Why throw your life away like this?

451
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,250
You killed him so easily.

452
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,860
Madam Ye, you're so ruthless!

453
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,940
You saw it, Sect Master Shi.

454
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,100
This beast caused trouble.

455
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,010
I had no choice but to put him down.

456
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,690
But...

457
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,490
we'll have to try another way to get news.

458
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,490
Rest easy.

459
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,530
I have my methods.

460
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,620
Guards! Drag him out.

461
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,820
Got bullied again?

462
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,530
Grandmaster.

463
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,050
Grandmaster!

464
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,140
I was wrong.

465
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,660
Grandmaster, in the Yin Palace I learned

466
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,860
someone is hunting for your trail.

467
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,530
Thankfully Ruling helped me slip away.

468
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,100
This... this is a tracking spell!

469
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,420
I've been tricked!

470
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,970
Why else would Shi Qianlv let you go?

471
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,620
So, they used me to get to you.

472
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,580
Grandmaster,

473
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,770
for bringing you such trouble,

474
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,210
I deserve to die.

475
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,450
No more nonsense.

476
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:09,970
Move.

477
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,140
Grandmaster, there's an array!

478
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,940
No point hiding.

479
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,290
Show yourself.

480
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,730
Forgive us, Grandmaster.

481
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,340
Even wounded as I am,

482
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,690
your tricks are far too weak.

483
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,050
Grandmaster!

484
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,180
Did you suffer a serious wound before,

485
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,050
and still not heal?

486
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,730
Go tell your master this,

487
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,250
"Sima Jiao never fought us.

488
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,900
Once he broke out of the array,

489
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,820
we lost track of him."

490
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,420
Why did you let them go?

491
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,140
Those puppets

492
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,580
can sense the Sima bloodline

493
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,210
within Shi territory

494
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,180
and seek out the Spirit Fire.

495
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,380
They are also the torches I've chosen.

496
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,340
When the time is right,

497
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,380
they will ignite the hidden fire I planted,

498
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,860
to complete the final step of my plan.

499
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,570
This must be kept secret from Ye Ruling.

500
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,380
Understood.

501
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,220
How was the tracking spell broken?

502
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,650
It was my failure.

503
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,380
I could only watch as Sima Jiao undid

504
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,570
both the array and the tracking spell,

505
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,940
then vanished.

506
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,170
And he didn't see you?

507
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,650
No, we kept hidden,

508
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,740
never fought him.

509
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,380
I'm off.

510
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,130
How did he escape?

511
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,650
Zhenxu,

512
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,450
I sent you

513
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,050
to investigate Ri Gui.

514
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,420
Any leads?

515
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,260
Nothing suspicious so far.

516
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,940
Now go check

517
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,220
if there's a spy among us.

518
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,900
Understood.

519
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,530
Too much livestreaming gets boring anyway.

520
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,090
Why aren't you back yet?

521
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,570
What's going on?

522
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,780
Did I mess up from learning too many spells lately?

523
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,260
I'll check some books.

524
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,260
What do you want to look up? I can teach you.

525
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,450
So you finally came back.

526
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,090
What were you drawing just now?

527
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,970
This is called an emoticon.

528
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,340
My personal code.

529
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,170
Cute, huh?

530
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,780
It's so late.

531
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,780
Why aren't you asleep?

532
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,130
What are you so smug about?

533
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,570
I wasn't waiting for you.

534
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,380
While you were gone,

535
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,050
I went to classes,

536
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,130
I hung out,

537
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,860
and I bought snacks, clothes, furniture.

538
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,610
I was living fine...

539
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,380
Don't worry.

540
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,940
These days won't last much longer.

541
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,490
If you're not well,

542
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,380
don't push yourself so hard.

543
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,700
No need to worry about me.

544
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,780
Tomorrow I'll stay here a while longer.

545
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,340
You really won't go out?

546
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,860
Is it to keep me company?

547
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,570
Do you like crowds?

548
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,450
In a few days,

549
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,450
it'll be the liveliest time

550
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,090
Gengchen Celestial Palace has seen.

551
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,380
Some kind of festival?

552
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,380
Don't tell me it's a date.

553
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,010
My heart's already racing.

554
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,650
Not a festival.

555
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,700
But I'll make it something

556
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,530
worth remembering.

557
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,860
Ah, so it's business after all.

558
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,220
There goes my little heart, crushed.

559
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,010
Didn't you say only when I'm worked up

560
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,740
you can hear my thoughts?

561
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,420
And you think you weren't worked up just now?

562
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,010
What's wrong?

563
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,570
Mad at me?

564
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,420
This person is now asleep.

565
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,090
Please leave a message after the beep.

566
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,010
Beep.

567
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,780
You laugh way too easily!

568
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,050
You're finally back,

569
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,420
and all you do is tease me.

570
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,300
Then tell me,

571
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,050
what do you like most?

572
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,050
Fish time.

What office drone doesn't?

574
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,900

577
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,050
Go ahead.

578
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,220
What do you mean?

579
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,170
You said you love fish time.

580
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,530
All this trouble...

581
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,970
just to fish?

582
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,650
I'm not going.

583
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,490
Why not?

584
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,380
The fish here are the best.

585
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,090
But diving in to catch them

586
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,940
is too much work.

587
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,900
Not a problem.

588
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,900
