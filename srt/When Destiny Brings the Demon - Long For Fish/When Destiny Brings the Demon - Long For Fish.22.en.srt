24
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,140
Young Master, please sit.

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,170
Mr. Ghost, I won't be taking jobs for now.

26
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,620
Is it because your friend Yan has gone missing?

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,090
You know something about it?

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,690
Lately, someone from the Zhihun clan in Winter City was killed.

29
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,340
I heard

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,570
the killer was brought before Sima Jiao,

31
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,460
the Celestial Palace man

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,970
who just took over Winter City.

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,220
The Zhihun clan holds sway in Winter City.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,300
I wondered who'd dare act so recklessly,

35
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,780
so I looked into it.

36
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,180
The killer should be Yan, no doubt.

37
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,410
You mean she's been caught?

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,460
I had people investigate yesterday,

39
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,460
and found her identity isn't simple.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,090
Turns out she was Demon Lord You Chi's assassin

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,650
to kill Sima Jiao.

42
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,370
She's a Frost Fish from White Bone Abyss.

43
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,650
Given Sima Jiao is merciless,

44
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,570
your friend may be

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,650
in grave danger.

46
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,180
She really is that Frost Fish?

47
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,410
I almost forgot.

48
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,620
Back then, Preceptor saved you

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,530
right from the White Bone Abyss.

50
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,850
Sounds like you've known that Frost Fish before.

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,220
So...

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,180
Yan's truly the one I've been searching for.

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,220
Young Master,

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,300
your father once followed the former Demon Lord You Yan,

55
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,220
fighting for the Demon Realm's cause,

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,850
and even raised You Chi.

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,780
Yet he ended up discarded

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,540
once he'd served his purpose,

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,810
thrown into the Nine Nether Purgatory.

60
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,620
Since you chose to hide away here,

61
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,500
it means you don't want to be entangled

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,300
in any power struggles.

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,010
Don't do anything foolish

64
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,300
like opposing Sima Jiao.

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,130
Am I just supposed to watch her die?

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,060
Young Master, don't take it so hard.

67
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,770
Besides, now she seems

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,940
to have forgotten her Frost Fish memories,

69
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,540
so she didn't recognize you.

70
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,060
What a pity for such a bond.

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,210
Yan, wait for me.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,300
I'll get you out!

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,980
Preceptor,

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,100
Feng Qi has set out for Winter City.

75
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,940
Good.

76
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,180
I knew he'd never forget that Frost Fish.

77
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,860
Lucky we never told him

78
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,060
that she saved him

79
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,890
on my orders.

80
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,330
And by then,

81
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,940
she'd had her emotions stripped away.

82
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,010
Even if her memory returned,

83
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,860
she'd still be a heartless assassin.

84
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,330
Now, with his obsession with her,

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,660
perhaps he can pull Liao Tingyan

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,010
away from Sima Jiao.

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,570
Then should we tell the Demon Lord

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,500
where Liao Tingyan is?

89
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,300
Do you think he even cares?

90
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,740
I spoke out of turn.

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,570
For now, what matters most is Feng Qi.

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,420
When You Yan's soul returns one day,

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,860
we'll still need the Chang family's bloodline

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,540
to help activate the blood array.

95
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,330
Keep a close eye on Feng Qi.

96
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,940
We mainly need him to bring out the Frost Fish,

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,740
but don't let him come to any harm.

98
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,500
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,770
Sima Jiao has no reason to lie to me.

100
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,300
He could've just killed me outright.

101
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,890
My original host really had something with him?

102
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,540
No wonder

103
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,980
my father refused to restore my memories.

104
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,890
So Shi Yan and Sima Jiao

105
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,660
are Romeo and Juliet,

106
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,770
star-crossed lovers bound by family feud.

107
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,060
No way...

108
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,770
Sima Jiao says my surname is Liao.

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,420
My father says it's Shi.

110
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,060
So who's telling the truth?

111
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,860
Ms. Yan, may I come in?

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,180
Ms. Yan, I finally see you!

113
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,540
You are just like my mother said,

114
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,660
so warm and familiar.

115
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,370
I specially prepared these new clothes for you.

116
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,940
Hurry and take off

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,660
that dirty outfit.

118
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,330
You are...?

119
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,770
I'm Zhou Yueqing,

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,130
daughter of Zhou Qing'er.

121
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,250
You and Grandmaster

122
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,810
saved me once eighteen years ago.

123
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,010
Now, you're the closest people I have.

124
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,980
Why say we're the closest to you?

125
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,130
You really don't remember?

126
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,300
Grandmaster and I share the Fengshan bloodline.

127
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,860
He's like family to me.

128
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,370
And since you and he are cultivation partners,

129
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,660
you're my family too.

130
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,300
I'm really his cultivation partner?

131
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,210
My mother said

132
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,300
you and Grandmaster are a perfect match.

133
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,660
Then do you know what my name was back then?

134
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,490
Liao Tingyan.

135
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,810
Don't put it there.

136
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,730
Why do they all say the same thing?

137
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,810
Could Sima Jiao have gathered people to trick me?

138
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,140
What's he after?

139
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,490
What's this about?

140
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,730
Grandmistress,

141
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,780
Grandmaster asked us to make the room more festive.

142
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,260
Does this look good?

143
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,090
I'm not the Grandmistress.

144
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,060
This is clearly a bridal chamber.

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,940
Sima Jiao wants to marry me?

146
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,420
That must be it.

147
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,660
I'd better get everything ready

148
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,660
for your wedding.

149
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,660
Hurry!

150
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,180
What's good about it?

151
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,020
If my father finds out,

152
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,940
he'll be furious!

153
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,380
What kind of nonsense is all this?

154
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,940
What's this?

155
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,900
You used

156
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,420
to love touching fish.

157
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,730
Touching fish?

158
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,140
Does he mean slacking off at work?

159
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,060
Maybe the original host just liked touching fish...

160
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,940
Still feels weird.

161
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,450
That's a pretty odd hobby.

162
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,660
You said you loved to touch fish.

163
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,260
Go on, touch it.

164
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,260
Fish time!

165
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,210
You're so lazy.

166
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,420
You like touching fish,

167
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,060
but only if someone catches one for you.

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,020
Guess you don't like it anymore.

169
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,900
I prepared food for you.

170
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,400
Why won't you eat?

171
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,180
I'm not hungry.

172
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,210
You once said

173
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,970
you eat not because you're hungry,

174
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,420
but because you enjoy it.

175
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,380
I don't enjoy it that much.

176
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,940
I eat just to fill my stomach.

177
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,020
You've reached Soulshift stage.

178
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,330
Do you still need to sleep?

179
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,850
No need, but I enjoy it.

180
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,380
Like food, no need to eat,

181
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,570
but I just enjoy it.

182
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,140
If a person can't even enjoy

183
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,140
sleeping or good food,

184
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,940
life loses much of its joy.

185
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,210
Well then,

186
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,900
why don't you try a little?

187
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,940
Afraid I tampered with the food?

188
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,020
No.

189
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,260
I've never seen someone look so pained eating.

190
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,300
It tastes bad. Forget it.

191
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,210
I'll find you something better.

192
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,300
No need.

193
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,900
Greetings, My lord!

194
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,420
[Wanted Notice]

195
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,330
Have you seen this person?

196
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,900
No, I haven't.

197
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,780
But no matter,

198
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,780
I'll help you find him!

199
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,140
Guys,

200
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,850
search for this one!

201
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,570
Yes!

202
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,660
This way, please.

203
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,380
Qianlv,

204
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,060
has Liao Tingyan been convinced by Sima Jiao

205
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,940
and turned on us?

206
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,330
Otherwise, how could he

207
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,570
find you so quickly?

208
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,610
Though Liao Tingyan

209
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,690
is a lazy good-for-nothing,

210
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,730
she's still loyal and true.

211
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,420
In the first two years after she lost her memory,

212
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,940
I kept her from meeting anyone.

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,140
That way I built her dependence on me.

214
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,260
Back then she was like a rabbit

215
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,380
thrown into a wolf's den,

216
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,180
and I was the only one she could trust.

217
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,210
Even now that she's lost her memory,

218
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,450
no matter how well Sima Jiao treats her,

219
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,210
I believe she'll never betray me.

220
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,940
So what do we do now?

221
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,850
All of Celestial Crane City is hunting us.

222
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,300
This place won't stay safe for long.

223
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,140
Let's leave Celestial Crane City first,

224
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,330
then plan our next move.

225
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,690
Boss, this is the place!

226
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,060
This is where we spotted them!

227
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,090
Search it!

228
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,810
Don't miss a spot!

229
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,570
Yes!

230
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,260
My lord,

231
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,330
no one inside,

232
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,610
but looks like they left not long ago.

233
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,810
No matter, the city's sealed.

234
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,610
He won't get out.

235
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,730
If he could escape from the Purgatory,

236
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,850
how could a little city gate

237
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,020
ever hold him?

238
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,380
Then what do we do?

239
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,900
The Demon Realm is vast,

240
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,210
fractured,

241
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,490
and full of hiding spots.

242
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,490
No matter.

243
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,300
We've got time

244
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,060
to wear him down.

245
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,090
Does Tingyan really eat

246
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,900
this plain every day?

247
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,450
If Grandmaster knew,

248
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,810
he'd feel awful.

249
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,940
Grandmaster looks fierce and ruthless,

250
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,140
but he's actually gentle and deep?

251
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,420
Depends on who it is.

252
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,810
I've followed Grandmaster four hundred years,

253
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,940
and he's never treated anyone else this gently.

254
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,260
I was born to be alone.

255
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,180
Over the years,

256
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,090
I never cared for anyone else.

257
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,730
But with you,

258
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,730
I gave all my heart.

259
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,850
In the end I was too arrogant,

260
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,060
and let you suffer all this.

261
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,620
Tingyan!

262
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,820
Yan, kill them!

263
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,250
Pathetic.

264
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,690
Give up your core,

265
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,660
and maybe I'll leave you and your father whole.

266
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,860
Yan!

267
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,490
Do it!

268
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,690
Please...

269
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,450
spare us...

270
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,530
Yan!

271
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,050
What are you waiting for?

272
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,420
If you don't kill them,

273
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,100
they'll kill you!

274
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,050
No...

275
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,940
Shut up!

276
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,230
Father...

277
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,580
Father...

278
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,380
Tingyan!

279
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,450
Strike!

280
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:16,970
No...

281
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,900
Do it!

282
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,210
Father...

283
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,050
Kill him.

284
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,210
Now!

285
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,530
Do it!

286
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,140
I taught her to kill like this.

287
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,140
Yan,

288
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,730
you finally struck back!

289
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,620
That's how you're meant to be!

290
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,140
Shi Qianlv.

291
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,450
I'll tear you limb from limb!

292
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,660
No!

293
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,900
Don't kill me!

294
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,140
It's you...

295
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,730

296
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,820
No, wait.

297
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,770
Seeing him, I should feel more nervous.

298
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,340
Why do I feel relieved instead?

299
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,620

378
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,730
All right. I'll be back soon.

379
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,820
- My lord! - My lord!

380
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,940
- My lord! - My lord!

381
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,530
My lord!

382
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,820
What are you two doing?

383
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,730
My lord, forgive us for not welcoming you properly.

384
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,620
Where's the girl

385
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,580
who danced here last time?

386
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,180
You mean Hongluo?

387
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,580
Wasn't she killed by your two men?

388
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,530
You mean the girl killed

389
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,340
by those Zhihun guys was her?

390
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,210
Yes.

391
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,940
That day, Hongluo

392
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,530
was on her way to visit you,

393
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,620
but she was ambushed.

394
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,690
Why did she want to see me?

395
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,970
Because she admired you, of course.

396
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,180
She said you and she

397
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,050
were fated lovers from a past life.

398
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,660
A past life?

399
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,660
Do you have a portrait of her?

400
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,490
Ruling?

401
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,340
My lord, what did you call her?

402
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,010
You knew her?

403
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,660
That girl

404
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,690
was truly pitiful.

405
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,660
When I found her,

406
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,490
her spirit sense was badly damaged.

407
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,770
She remembered nothing.

408
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,100
All she had left was a tube whistle.

409
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,660
I spent countless demon stones

410
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,450
trying to heal her wounds.

411
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,210
And yet...

412
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,100
Tube whistle...

413
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,210
Where exactly did you find her?

414
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,970
By Yin-Yang Lake.

415
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,820
I haven't slept this well in ages.

416
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,380
Wait,

417
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,860
how am I sleeping so soundly in enemy territory?

418
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,340
But days without being forced

419
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,940
to cleanse my marrow or seek revenge

420
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,730
are really good.

421
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,450
Did you have nightmares?

422
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,490
No.

423
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,620
I actually slept till morning.

424
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,940
What used to be

425
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,970
so ordinary,

426
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,380
now...

427
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,100
feels rare.

428
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,290
Ms. Yan, taste this.

429
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,450
Why does it look like the braised pig's trotters in Celestial Crane City,

430
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,860
the ones Hongluo, Feng Qi, and I often ate?

431
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,180
It really is the same!

432
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,730
You like it?

433
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,290
Mostly because I had it often.

434
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,490
It just feels familiar.

435
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,210
Bi'an,

436
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,420
do you remember the cook who made this?

437
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,860
Yes.

438
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,940
Is he trustworthy?

439
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,370
All who enter the manor

440
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,010
have been vetted by Nianjiu.

441
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,770
I'll bring him here right away.

442
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,340
I always feel like I've stolen someone's boyfriend.

443
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,100
But I can't tell him I'm a time traveler.

444
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,010
What kind of trashy body-double drama is this?

445
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,380
If Sima Jiao finds out the truth,

446
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,770
will he wipe me out?

447
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,620
You really didn't need to find me a cook.

448
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,490
Once Hongluo is revived, I'll just leave with her.

449
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,290
No need to trouble you.

450
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,900
Where are you going?

451
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,010
Back to Shi Qianlv?

452
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,100
Even if you hate him,

453
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,180
he's still my father.

454
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,530
I plan

455
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,100
to take him and Hongluo somewhere safe,

456
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,290
and live the rest of our lives quietly.

457
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,970
We won't bother you anymore.

458
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,140
Where's the place

459
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,580
you speak of?

460
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,250
Afraid I can't tell you.

461
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,730
After all, you and my father are sworn enemies.

462
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,900
So in your vision of the future,

463
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,860
I have no place at all.

464
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,250
Things between us are awkward now.

465
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,620
About the past,

466
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,660
I probably forgot it.

467
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,380
Even though I live well here,

468
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,420
it still feels uncomfortable.

469
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,290
So maybe we should part ways,

470
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,970
and each live our own lives.

471
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,420
You've forgotten the past,

472
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,820
but that doesn't matter.

473
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,290
Wherever you want to go,

474
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,490
I can take you.

475
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,860
Wherever I want to go,

476
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,420
I can go myself.

477
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,730
I'm grateful for your kindness,

478
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,940
but the Shi Yan I am now

479
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,730
isn't the Liao Tingyan you remember.

480
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,580
Do you understand?

481
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,820
I won't mistake you.

482
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,770
No, you don't understand.

483
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,250
Grandmaster, Ms. Yan,

484
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,380
I've brought the cook.

485
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,860
Greetings, Grandmaster.

486
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,100
Grandmistress kept you here.

487
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,050
You should thank her too.

488
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,010
Thanks for your kindness, miss.

489
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,220
Miss?

490
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,420
The braised pig's trotters you like

491
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,650
are made with a secret method.

492
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,700
If you're interested,

493
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,450
I can explain in detail

494
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,170
how to prepare them.

495
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,450
I'm very interested.

496
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,700
I'd love to discuss it with you.

497
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,900
Then I won't waste your time.

498
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,940
Please.

499
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,420
How did you know I was here?

500
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,090
Finding you wasn't hard.

501
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,170
Well?

502
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,010
Pretty loyal of me, right?

503
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,740
I came all this way to find you.

504
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,340
That's way too risky.

505
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,300
What if I hadn't eaten your food?

506
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,530
Then you'd have come for nothing.

507
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,220
We've known each other for years.

508
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,220
Don't I already know what food you like?

509
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,050
We've got that kind of understanding.

510
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,650
So confident, huh?

511
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,860
Go on, eat up.

512
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,340
Then come with me.

513
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,420
I'll leave only after Sima Jiao revives Hongluo.

514
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,380
He can revive Hongluo?

515
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,050
Why would he be so kind?

516
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,050
I think... I used to be his cultivation partner.

517
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,010
Either you were,

518
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,610
or you weren't.

519
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,820
What do you mean "think"?

520
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,860
Well,

521
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,650
you probably don't know

522
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,700
how I got this scar.

523
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,450
I once suffered a grave injury.

524
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,650
After that, the scar stayed on my face,

525
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,780
and all my memories were gone.

526
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,650
According to Sima Jiao,

527
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,900
before I lost my memory, I was his cultivation partner.

528
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,780
Then he healed the scar?

529
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,420
Did it heal completely?

530
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,260
Yan,

531
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,650
did you stay

532
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,950
just for Hongluo,

533
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,700
or are you drawn to how well Sima Jiao treats you?

534
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,970
He treats me well because of who I used to be.

535
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,130
I'm not that full of myself.

536
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm glad you get that.

537
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,700
In a while, I'll find a way

538
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,900
to take you and Hongluo away together.

539
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,050
Who sent you?

540
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,530
Do you know her?

541
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,050
No...

542
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,450
Feng Qi, don't...

543
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,490
I don't just know her.

544
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,970
We ate and slept side by side, sharing life and death.

545
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,420
We're inseparable.

546
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,420
What nonsense is this?

547
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,340
Stop making trouble.

548
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,260
You're asking for death.

549
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,340
Wait!

550
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,220
Allow me to introduce.

551
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,340
- Yan... - This is Feng Qi, my friend.

552
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,650
Didn't you tell me

553
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,740
Hongluo was your only friend?

554
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,010
Different kind of friend.

555
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,300
Hongluo is my girlfriend.

556
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,300
And Feng Qi is...

557
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,970
Your boyfriend?

558
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,700
You know what "boyfriend" means?

559
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,700
You told me before.

560
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,860
That's impossible.

561
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,380
Is he

562
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,780
your boyfriend or not?

563
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,170
No, he's not my boyfriend.

564
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,340
Get out now,

565
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,610
and I'll spare your life.

566
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,090
Feng Qi.

567
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,900
Even if I die, I won't leave her.

568
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,380
Hopeless fool.

569
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,140
Courting death.

570
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,420
I...

571
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,050
Wait!

572
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,970
Stop this!

573
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,380
Why are you acting tough here?

574
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,900
Leave now.

575
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,050
I'll be fine!

576
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,170
I didn't come here

577
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,530
planning to leave alone.

578
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,490
Why don't you

579
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,050
kill me in front of her,

580
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,340
and see if that wins you her heart?

581
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,450
Don't you dare touch him.

582
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,900
Or I'll truly see you as my enemy.

583
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,130
Yan,

584
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,740
don't fall for his tricks.

585
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,490
People from the Celestial Palace are born liars.

586
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,900
Better than putting on a tough act like you.

587
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,130
What was that just now?

588
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,780
Don't tell me you've fallen for...

589
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,050
Now tell me,

590
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,820
you still think about that girl

591
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,340
who once saved your life, don't you?

592
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,940
That's right.

593
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,450
I've never forgotten her.

594
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,970
Good.

595
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,220
I thought you might feel something for me...

596
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,050
Why pretend we had something

597
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,570
in front of him?

598
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,900
Weren't you afraid he'd kill you?

599
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,700
I...

600
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,170
I just...

601
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,220
I just couldn't stand his smug face.

602
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,450
Lucky for you Sima Jiao isn't the ruthless killer

603
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,450
from the rumors.

604
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,490
Otherwise you'd be long dead.

605
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,260
So you already think he's not so bad?

606
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,340
Did Sima Jiao put some spell

607
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,130
on you?

608
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,490
No.

609
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,570
But honestly,

610
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,050
he's nothing like the stories say.

611
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,380
Not scary at all,

612
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,900
in fact, kind of considerate.

613
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,700
Almost like a little cat,

614
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,380
proud on the surface,

615
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,010
but quietly watching over my needs.

616
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,090
Maybe deep down he's softer than he lets on.

617
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,740
I plan

618
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,340
to take him and Hongluo somewhere safe,

619
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,300
and live the rest of our lives quietly.

620
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,820
We won't bother you anymore.

621
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,450
Things between us are awkward now.

622
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,090
About the past,

623
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,220
I probably forgot it.

624
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,780
So maybe we should part ways,

625
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,300
and each live our own lives.

626
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,940
I'm grateful for your kindness,

627
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,130
but the Shi Yan I am now

628
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,010
isn't the Liao Tingyan you remember.
