22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,530
Master Yin,

23
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,810
why haven't the elders

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,250
from your palace come back yet?

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,090
Could it be that I was right,

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,530
and the Grandmaster's spiritual power hasn't weakened?

27
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,420
Everyone, keep calm.

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,700
Just wait patiently.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,010
Do you remember what I taught you?

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,090
Where should you stab for the best effect?

31
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,410
Do it.

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,690
Do it!

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,850
Why are you all forcing me to do things?

34
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,900
Boss,

35
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,130
are you trying to frame me?

36
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,570
No...

37
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,500
I've killed someone.

38
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,090
I've killed someone.

39
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,460
The spirit vein really has weakened.

40
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,500
Perfect chance!

41
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,340
You're not getting ahead of me.

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,650
Madam Xing,

43
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,690
aren't you going in?

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,090
Sect Master Shi,

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,940
you are the Grandmaster's guardian.

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,570
If even you are not going in,

47
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,620
how could I act rashly?

48
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,370
You were there

49
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,250
when the Grandmaster was sealed.

50
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,340
You know better than anyone how powerful he is.

51
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,540
Is it true his spiritual power weakens on the night

52
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,770
of the new moon?

53
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,770
I don't know.

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,980
But I don't think the Grandmaster will allow himself to be prey.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,010
Grandmaster, wake up.

56
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,010
Grandmaster.

57
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,860
Grandmaster?

58
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,980
Wake up!

59
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,980
Grandmaster!

60
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,620
You're noisy.

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,010
Are you all right?

62
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,250
Scared?

63
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,010
Of course I'm scared.

64
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,210
I've never even killed a chicken,

65
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,370
and you told me to kill you.

66
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,980
Why did you run into my blade?

67
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,500
Relax.

68
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,180
It's just a necessary step to break the seals.

69
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,060
What do you mean?

70
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,980
The real show is about to start.

71
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,980
Grandmaster,

72
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,570
how did you end up so badly injured?

73
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,500
Grandmaster,

74
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,060
are you well?

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,180
The one next to the Grandmaster.

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,660
You.

77
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,250
Check his pulse.

78
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,100
How do I do that?

79
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,130
I've never studied Traditional Chinese Medicine.

80
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,660
No need to check.

81
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,890
Just look at him.

82
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,010
He's clearly at his limit.

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,890
Indeed.

84
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,890
I am gravely wounded,

85
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,980
and my spiritual power is almost gone.

86
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,770
I suppose that's why

87
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,180
you've all shown up.

88
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,010
Everyone is here, huh?

89
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,180
Good.

90
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,210
I am right here.

91
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,740
Come and take my life.

92
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,420
Grandmaster,

93
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,420
where is this confidence coming from?

94
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,740
I almost killed you earlier,

95
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,450
and now we're facing death together?

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,570
If I don't let you die,

97
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,740
you won't die.

98
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,740
Sima Jiao,

99
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,010
even now, you're still so arrogant.

100
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,250
We sent our disciples here to serve you out of goodwill,

101
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,130
yet you killed them without cause.

102
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,180
Why?

103
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,060
Which palace are you from?

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,540
After being locked away by you for 500 years,

105
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,500
I can hardly tell you people apart.

106
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,450
Of those old fools who sealed me back then,

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,420
why are there only three of you here?

108
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,620
Without everyone present,

109
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,180
how can my desire for revenge be satisfied?

110
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,540
He's picking a fight even now?

111
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,810
He's really something else.

112
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,250
I'm impressed.

113
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,180
Everyone,

114
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,810
you all heard him, right?

115
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,620
Sima Jiao wants to settle old scores with us.

116
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,370
If we join forces tonight,

117
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,860
we can finish him.

118
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,620
If we let him live,

119
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,420
he'll kill us all sooner or later.

120
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,540
Fools. Absolute fools.

121
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,620
If I die,

122
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,420
there will be no one left to sustain the Spirit Fire.

123
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,420
Are you sure you want that?

124
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,690
Once you are dead,

125
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,420
with the Bloodseal Bloom and your corpse in our hands,

126
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,010
we can still protect everyone in the Gengchen Celestial Palace.

127
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,810
By Bloodseal Bloom, do you mean this?

128
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,300
It's a trap!

129
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,850
Sima Jiao lured us here

130
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,210
to use our blood to break the seals.

131
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,260
Run!

132
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,970
Where are you going?

133
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,210
It's the Spirit Fire!

134
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,610
We're trapped.

135
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,780
Grandmaster,

136
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,330
this must be a misunderstanding.

137
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,570
We have no ill intent.

138
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,020
At least we of the Heaven Palace

139
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,140
mean no disrespect to you.

140
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,570
So it's true.

141

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,810
Good to hear.

189
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,970
The seals have actually been broken.

190
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,020
I knew it.

191
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,610
The claim that his power would weaken was a lie.

192
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,420
If the Grandmaster spread that rumor, he must have had a plan.

193
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,060
There must be a sea of blood up there now.

194
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,780
Enough.

195
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,610
Let's go and check.

196
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,540
Look at them.

197
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,610
Each one would be a figure to be feared outside.

198
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,380
But look at them now.

199
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,570
How pathetic.

200
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,330
What are your thoughts on this?

201
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,780
Your waist is so slim.

202
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,810
What?

203
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,690
I think you must have been locked away too long

204
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,730
and starved into this shape.

205
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,780
You are not wrong.

206
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,140
The pain I've endured will be repaid.

207
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,730
Every bit of it.

208
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,330
That's not what I meant.

209
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,380
Master Yin!

210
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,620
Grandmaster,

211
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,490
does this mean I don't have to be buried with you?

212
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,050
Do you not want to die?

213
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,420
Of course not.

214
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,380
I was nearly scared to death just now.

215
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,340
Come on.

216
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,860
Hurry.

217
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,450
The Grandmaster is out.

218
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,290
Come on.

219
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,420
Welcome back from seclusion, Grandmaster!

220
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,340
Welcome back from seclusion, Grandmaster!

221
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,100
Liao Tingyan, your neglect in service

222
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,860
nearly brought ruin to the sect's lifeblood.

223
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,100
Grandmaster,

224
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,730
allow me to cleanse the sect for you today!

225
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,620
Oh, no...

226
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,450
Grandmaster, please forgive him.

227
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,940
How dare you act with such impudence before me?

228
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,620
Spare me, Grandmaster.

229
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,380
I was only concerned for you.

230
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,620
What are you afraid of?

231
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,820
I told you,

232
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,730
if I don't let you die,

233
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,290
you won't die.

234
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,290
Is this disciple from the Four Seasons Palace?

235
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,730
Why has she earned such favor from the Grandmaster?

236
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,770
I've never seen her before either.

237
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,660
He slaughtered the disciples

238
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,970
we sent into the mountain without hesitation.

239
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,860
Why is he keeping this low-level,

240
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,820
three-spiritual-root disciple?

241
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,210
What use could she be?

242
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,100
You know perfectly well what you were thinking

243
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,380
when you sent in the disciples

244
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,970
in the first place.

245
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,660
You!

246
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,140
Grandmaster,

247
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,580
with the Three Saints Mountain in ruins,

248
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,770
why don't you stay at White Deer Cliff for now?

249
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,580
Once the disciples have repaired this place,

250
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,940
we will invite you back.

251
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,100
You plan to drag me back and seal me for another 500 years?

252
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,900
That's not what I meant, Grandmaster.

253
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,690
I just...

254
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,290
Enough.

255
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,580
Grandmaster,

256
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,290
you're not going to kill me

257
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,380
because I saw you

258
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,420
kill someone, right?

259
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,690
What are you thinking?

260
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,210
If you want to kill me, go ahead.

261
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,210
Stop playing with my mind.

262
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,140
If you're tired of killing,

263
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,770
why not wash up and get some sleep?

264
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,620
Very well.

265
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,690
Sect Master Shi,

266
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,660
what does the Grandmaster intend by this?

267
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,690
Boss...

268
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,450
Grandmaster,

269
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,580
I still want to live.

270
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,380
Please don't kill me.

271
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,900
Then I will spare your life.

272
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,420
I didn't see it coming at all.

273
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,530
Is that so?

274
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,770
Well, I have prepared for that moment for 500 years.

275
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,420
I have always known I would need the blood

276
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,770
of the direct bloodlines of the Eight Palaces

277
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,290
to break the seals and barriers.

278
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,050
The challenge was

279
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,140
gathering the blood from all eight bloodlines.

280
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,490
I could not leave,

281
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,010
so I had to make them come to me.

282
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,820
I forged the Spirit Fire's avatar

283
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,010
and improved my cultivation

284
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,180
for the sole purpose of igniting fear in the Eight Palaces.

285
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,450
Grandmaster, please quell your anger.

286
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,140
Grandmaster, please quell your anger!

287
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,660
They feared I would break the seals and barriers,

288
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,620
so they sent people into the mountain.

289
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,050
I am Wan Ling. I worship you, Grandmaster,

290
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,820
and wish to serve you.

291
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,660
Once the disciples they sent were killed,

292
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,050
their fear grew

293
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,690
and drove them to act.

294
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,730
The Grandmaster must still be holding onto past grudges.

295
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,940
Then we should strike first.

296
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,690
Remove the barrier outside the tower.

297
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,210
Mice will slip in

298
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,450
through the cracks.

299
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,860
The first new moon night

300
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,580
is when I am at my weakest.

301
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,420
Those disciples who slipped out to report

302
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,420
lured the palace heads to strike at me in my moment of weakness.

303
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,900
Master, the new moon night is the one rare time

304
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,620
in 500 years when he is truly weak.

305
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,970
But rumors alone were far from enough.

306
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,210
We just have to see if the spirit vein

307
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,730
will weaken on the night of the new moon.

308
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,580
The sealing nails within the Grandmaster

309
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,490
prevent him from taking his own life.

310
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,900
That much cannot be faked.

311
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,820
Today, you don't need to do any chores.

312
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,490
You need only learn one thing:

313
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,860
a killing technique.

314
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,690
Do you remember what I taught you?

315
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,420
Where should you stab for the best effect?

316
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,010
Do it.

317
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,290
Why are you all forcing me to do things?

318
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,530
I am one with the Spirit Fire.

319
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,380
When my heart is damaged,

320
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,970
the spirit vein connected to the Spirit Fire

321
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,250
also gets affected.

322
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,050
Only when the Eight Palaces saw with their own eyes

323
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,340
the signs of my weakness

324
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,660
would they rush into the mountain without hesitation.

325
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,490
The spirit vein really has weakened.

326
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,530
Perfect chance!

327
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,250
You're not getting ahead of me.

328
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,490
Letting you stab me

329
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,490
was the final step to making this plan succeed.

330
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,620
Then why didn't you stab yourself?

331
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,250
Why did you make me do it?

332
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,900
Those old fools of the Gengchen Celestial Palace

333
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,620
were afraid I would

334
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,620
take my own life and make the sect's spiritual power vanish,

335
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,580
so they placed restrictions on the sealing nails,

336
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,420
making it impossible for me to harm myself.

337
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,180
That is why the sword

338
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,380
had to be wielded by you.

339
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,770
Besides,

340
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,690
had I not made you do it,

341
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,900
how could I have truly confirmed

342
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,340
whether you meant me no harm?

343
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,690
So you bet your life on it?

344
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,860

I wonder how long he will keep being crazy.

[White Deer Cliff]
Grandmaster, the place is ready.

450
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,010
Grandmaster,

451
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,970
after the great fire back then,

452
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,970
I rebuilt this mansion

453
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,660
on White Deer Cliff.

454
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,050
Although it no longer has its former glory,

455
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,140
everything is still as it was.

456
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,490
You can stay here in peace with this disciple.

457
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,690
Come here.

458
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,730
I know you don't like being disturbed, Grandmaster,

459
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,900
so I've specially selected some puppet servants.

460
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,290
They have neither consciousness nor souls,

461
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,010
so you can command them as you wish.

462
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,050
Grandmaster!

463
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,140
While you were in seclusion,

464
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,140
I couldn't serve you at your side.

465
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,210
Now that you have left the mountain,

466
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,730
the Shi family should fulfill the duty that our ancestors

467
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,450
entrusted to us.

468
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,490
Otherwise,

469
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,940
we will not know how to conduct ourselves

470
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,220
within the Gengchen Celestial Palace.

471
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,420
Please allow it, Grandmaster.

472
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,170
Sect Master Shi.

473
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,940
You have always protected the Sima clan,

474
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,010
and yet you still managed to remain unscathed amidst the power struggles

475
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,260
of the Eight Palaces.

476
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,220
You have worked hard.

477
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,970
I will guard the Gengchen Celestial Palace for you

478
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,260
and wait for your return, Grandmaster!

479
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,050
The scenery is nice enough,

480
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,860
but I'm the only one here

481
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,450
to face this bloodthirsty Grandmaster.

482
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,260
Who knows how much longer I will survive?

483
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,130
Did you not rest well?

484
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,420
I'm well rested.

485
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,780
Then why aren't you the same as usual today?

486
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,570
What am I usually like?

487
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,260
Full of problems,

488
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,780
nonsense,

489
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,420
and all sorts of gibberish I cannot understand.

490
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,380
What are you thinking?

491
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,090
I'm wondering if those people really had to die.

492
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,530
You think I wronged them?

493
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,300
I just want to know why.

494
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,170
He's actually not mad?

495
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,860
His temper is as unpredictable as a cat's.

496
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,380
Do you like it here?

497
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,130
Yes.

498
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,650
I hate it here.

499
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,340
But it is

500
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,940
still my home.

501
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,570
I saw these flowers back on Three Saints Mountain.

502
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,420
That was close.

503
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,090
These flowers

504
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,170
are called Moonshade Blooms.

505
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,010
Their seeds are the bone pearls left in the bodies

506
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,220
of Sima clan members after death.

507
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,220
One bone pearl can grow into one flower.

508
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,170
So this is basically a cemetery?

509
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,010
There are so many flowers.

510
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,900
So many people have died.

511
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,650
The bodies of Sima clan members

512
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,220
vanish after death.

513
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,300
All that can remain is a single pearl.

514
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,090
I kept many pearls.

515
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,700
I scattered some of them in the Three Saints Mountain,

516
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,650
and others here,

517
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,650
and then they bloomed into these flowers.

518
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,490
That is both terrifying and romantic.

519
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,220
I will give you one.

520
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,260
Pick whichever you like.

521
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,300
If I pick a flower,

522
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,170
will you kill me?

523
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,340
One more thing.

524
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,610
The most unusual thing about the Moonshade Bloom

525
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,220
is that if the bone pearl comes from an evil person,

526
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,780
the flower will be a deadly poison with no antidote.

527
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,340
If it comes from a good person, it will be

528
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,260
a spiritual medicine that can neutralize poison.

529
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,260
But all the flowers look the same,

530
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,050
so no one can tell them apart.

531
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,970
Could mine be poisonous?

532
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,170
So far, everything seems fine.

533
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,450
So that night

534
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,970
on the Three Saints Mountain,

535
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,170
Yu Rongrong died because she picked a poisonous flower?

536
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,940
Greedy people never have good luck.

537
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,300
Thankfully, I did not dare touch the flowers then.

538
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,940
But isn't having both an incurable poison

539
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,700
and an antidote for the poison

540
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,090
a complete contradiction?

541
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,820
Since you are still standing here,

542
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,820
you must have picked the medicine.

543
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,820
You are lucky.

544
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,530
Did I die from the flower's poison? Where am I?

545
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,450
Isn't that the Grandmaster's little flame?

546
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,220
- Little flame... - Get lost, all of you!

547
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,450

00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,130
Out!

549
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,970
This one sounds different.

550
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,740
Looks like it's not the same flame.

551
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,780
Why is your temper always so bad?

552
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,900
Nonsense.

553
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,940
You only ever come at the wrong time. That's all.

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,050
just like the Grandmaster.

557
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,860
When I come tomorrow,

558
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,530
will I catch you in a good mood?

559
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,530
I've never taken my temper out on you.

560
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,860
It's the other Sima clan members

561
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,220
who keep annoying me.

562
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,420
So she's a member of the Grandmaster's clan.

563
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,280
[Zichen Hall]

564
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,170
This looks like White Deer Cliff in the past.

565
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,420
Sima E, stop being so stubborn.

566
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,780
I don't want to marry him.

567
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:11,970
I will not marry him!

568
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,450
Preserving the pure bloodline of the Fengshan line

569
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,340
to feed the Spirit Fire

570
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,160
- is the Sima clan's mission. - Her again?

571
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,700
Then I must have entered her memory.

572
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,780
But I don't love him.

573
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,530
Nonsense.

574
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,260
How can the clan's mission be weighed against personal feelings?

575
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,570
You and Sima Shi are of the same clan but different branches.

576
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,340
You were born to bear the duty of continuing the Fengshan line.

577
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,170
This marriage follows both propriety and custom.

578
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,940
You're forcing me to marry and bear children?

579
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,970
It must be the Eight Palace heads' idea again.

580
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,220
Look at us now.

581
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,780
Do we still look like we are in charge of the Celestial Palace?

582
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,130
We are nothing

583
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,570
more than puppets to keep the Eight Palaces' glory alive.

584
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,010
This concerns the prosperity and stability of the Celestial Palace.

585
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,420
E, stop being so obstinate.

586
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,260
Get out!

587
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,700
Leave now, or I will burn you alive!

588
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,260
How tragic. She has no freedom to choose whom to marry,

589
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,970
is constantly manipulated,

590
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,490
and shoulders the fate of an entire clan.

591
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,130
But why would the Eight Palaces

592
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,650
stoop to forcing marriages for heirs?

593
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,610
How is a life like this

594
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,820
any different from being a caged bird?

595
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,340
As long as I exist,

596
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,970
the fate of the Sima clan will never change.

597
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,970
People's greed has pushed us

598
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,780
to the brink of despair.

599
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,260
If one day,

600
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,450
the Fengshan Spirit Fire ceases to exist,

601
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,220
the Sima clan

602
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,170
might finally be free.

603
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,260
But now, the Grandmaster is still feeding the Spirit Fire.

604
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,260
A wedding?

605
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,780
She gave in after all.

606
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,300
Marriage should be a willing,

607
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,780
joyful thing,

608
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,220
yet here it feels so suffocating.

609
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,380
Today, Sima Shi and Sima E are joined as partners

610
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,090
to continue the bloodline of Fengshan

611
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,570
and nourish the Spirit Fire!

612
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,010
The Eight Palaces are truly revolting.

613
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,450
I can't believe

614
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,650
the Sima clan

615
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,380
was bullied like this back then.

616
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,380
Where am I now?

617
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,130
There...

618
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,900
E,

619
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,220
give our child a name.

620
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,490
Let's call him Jiao.

621
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,170
