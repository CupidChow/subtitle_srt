00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,690
I can move around more freely than you.

189
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,210
I'll go out and see

190
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,260
how the search went.

191
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,730
You stay here and wait for me.

192
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,090
Centuries of my clan's work,

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,140
all ruined by that brat!

194
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,660
Once I complete my great plan,

195
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,780
I'll flay him alive

196
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,300
and tear out his tendons!

197
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,570
Sect Master,

198
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,060
we've searched the surrounding area,

199
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,570
but there's no sign of Sima Jiao.

200
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,540
He was already gravely injured.

201
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,380
In such a short time,

202
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,940
how could he just vanish?

203
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,970
Keep searching!

204
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,020
Bring him back to me, even if you have to dig deep into the ground!

205
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,940
Understood.

206
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,020
Father,

207
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,900
what should we do next?

208
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,090
Sima Jiao was badly wounded in the siege.

209
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,300
With his condition,

210
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,660
even if he hides for a few days, it won't help him.

211
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,260
Now that my plan is exposed

212
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,260
and Baifeng Mountain is destroyed,

213
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,180
our only option

214
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,810
is to take advantage of his injuries

215
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,850
and seal him away again.

216
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,940
But with Baifeng Mountain exposed,

217
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,090
I fear

218
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,020
the Eight Palaces may...

219
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,020
They are too busy hunting Sima Jiao right now

220
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,490
to think about that!

221
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,730
Zhenxu,

222
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,450
clean this place up.

223
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,300
Don't leave a single witness alive.

224
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,940
Yes, Father.

225
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,660
You're a demonic cultivator, aren't you?

226
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,450
Me, a demonic cultivator?

227
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,610
If the Sect Master or the other palace heads

228
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,450
learn your true identity,

229
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,730
do you think Sima Jiao will still protect you?

230
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,450
Well,

231
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,330
even though I'm a demonic cultivator,

232
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,140
I don't think I've ever harmed anyone.

233
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,450
Don't be nervous, miss.

234
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,850
I know.

235
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,660
My eyes can tell good from evil,

236
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,420
so I know

237
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,570
you are not one of the wicked.

238
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,940
Thank goodness.

239
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,540
You scared me.

240
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,260
I thought you were going to take my life.

241
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,730
Many years ago,

242
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,210
I met Sima Jiao once at the Three Saints Mountain.

243
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,780
He was still very young then,

244
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,380
yet he already showed

245
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,850
extraordinary intelligence and insight.

246
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,260
I gave him the Taoist name "Mercy"

247
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,690
in hopes that he would have compassion for living beings

248
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,900
and restrain his urge to kill.

249
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,690
I foresaw

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,610
that he would single-handedly destroy the Gengchen Celestial Palace,

251
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,060
nearly overturn the entire cultivation world,

252
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,900
and slaughter countless innocent mortals.

253
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,660
Fertile lands would be scorched barren.

254
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,900
The Immortal Realm would become hell.

255
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,780
The world would fall into devastation.

256
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,060
And he would commit terrible sins.

257
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,780
The Grandmaster may look ruthless,

258
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,810
but he doesn't kill indiscriminately.

259
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,940
Nothing in this world is absolute.

260
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,260
Even in a dead end, there may be a thread of hope.

261
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,490
In his blood-soaked, murderous future,

262
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,540
I caught sight of a faint glimmer of life.

263
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,660
So I foretold

264
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,300
that he would one day encounter a turning point,

265
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,730
a person who would change him.

266
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,090
Who is that person?

267
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,970
Back then, I left a prayer bead on him

268
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,850
to suppress his viciousness

269
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,210
and help keep his mind clear.

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,850
But at the same time,

271
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,810
if he gave in to killing intent,

272
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,730
he would be overcome by unbearable pain.

273
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,210
So this bead isn't just an ornament.

274
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,450
This prayer bead

275
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,180
is seen by others only as a seal that binds him.

276
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,610
From the day it was put on, no one has been able to remove it.

277
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,210
But in truth, it is also a divine medicine.

278
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,900
If you can undo this seal,

279
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,970
the bead can save his life once.

280
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,580
If not,

281
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,010
it means

282
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,820
Sima Jiao never found that spark of hope,

283
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,970
and today

284
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,690
will be his end.

285
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,900
Can't you just save him yourself?

286
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,010
Why don't you try?

287
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,900
I thought so.

288
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,340
Since you are Sima Jiao's one chance at life,

289
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,010
you are also the hope of all living beings.

290
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,970
I ask that you

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,290
guide Sima Jiao from now on.

292
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,860
Lead him toward the good.

293
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,490
There are other Spirit Fires in the world.

294
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,380
Tell him to handle them with care

295
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,290
and use them for righteous deeds.

296
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,730
Other Spirit Fires?

297
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,010
What do you mean?

298
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,050
Pass the message to Sima Jiao.

299
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,970
He will understand.

300
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,660
But look at him now.

301
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,100
He's gravely injured.

302
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,210
No number of bandages would be enough.

303
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,860
Master...

304
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,210
Master?

305
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,940
My connection with the Fengshan Clan

306
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,770
ends here.

307
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,490
Take care.

308
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,050
You're leaving just like that?

309
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,860
This bead

310
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,580
was taken off your ankle,

311
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,250
but surely you wouldn't mind, right?

312
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,140
His complexion looks better than before.

313
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,620
Finally, I've managed to save you for once.

I originally planned to use the Fengshan clansmen on Baifeng Mountain

333
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,770
to complete my grand plan,

334
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,770
but he has ruined everything!

335
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,900
He will repay

336
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,730
what he destroyed

337
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,730
with his own blood!

338
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,580
Don't worry, Father.

339
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,690
Even if we cannot find Sima Jiao here,

340
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,250
the Eight Palaces have spies

341
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,770
everywhere in the Celestial Palace.

342
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,290
He may hide for a while,

343
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,180
but he cannot hide forever.

344
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,250
Exactly.

345
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,340
My people are everywhere.

346
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:46,770
Father,

347
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,530
why don't I return now

348
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,180
to investigate the movements of the Eight Palaces for you?

349
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,450
At a time like this,

350
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,140
you are still caught up in romance?

351
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,620
I apologize, Father.

352
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,210
But

353
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,140
I have never asked you for anything.

354
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,380
My only wish is to be with Anxue.

355
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,580
I beg you, Father, let us be together.

356
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,860
Zhenxu,

357
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,490
I don't want to go against your wish,

358
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,940
but Sima Jiao found Anxue

359
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,530
while you were away

360
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,770
and killed her in the cruelest way!

361
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,490
I couldn't do anything.

362
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,530
And for fear of exposing myself,

363
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,180
I couldn't even recover her body.

364
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,380
What?

365
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,100
No... impossible.

366
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,380
That's impossible.

367
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,180
Anxue was always so cautious.

368
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,490
This can't be. How could this happen?

369
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,580
No...

370
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,940
Sima Jiao...

371
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,620
I will kill Sima Jiao

372
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,900
to avenge Anxue!

373
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,450
Zhenxu,

374
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,490
when do you plan to perform Soul Cleanse on Anxue?

375
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,770
Remember:

376
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,100
apart from me, no one

377
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,340
is truly trustworthy in this world.

378
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,420
In our great undertaking,

379
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,450
there must not be the slightest flaw.

380
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,530
Father.

381
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,100
Father.

382
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,140
I have always revered you.

383
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,820
I've worked hard since childhood.

384
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,620
You know

385
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,450
the only one I ever loved

386
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,100
was Anxue.

387
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,820
You know how much I loved her.

388
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,050
What are you implying?

389
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,530
Why are you saying this to me?

390
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,050
You are my son.

391
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,250
Of course I know you better than anyone else.

392
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,290
What is it?

393
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,490
Do you think I am lying to you?

394
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,100
No.

395
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,290
No.

396
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,380
I would never think that.

397
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,290
Good.

398
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,860
Get up.

399
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,580
Zhenxu,

400
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,290
from now on,

401
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,340
don't let yourself be entangled in love again.

402
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,490
Our top priority now is to capture Sima Jiao

403
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,180
so we can complete our plan

404
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,580
and attain immortality.

405
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,900
Yes.

406
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,250
When we achieve our goal, I will kill Sima Jiao

407
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,730
to avenge Anxue!

408
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,010
You're still sleeping?

409
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,660
He's about to die!

410
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,660
I just gave him a life-saving pill.

411
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,180
His Soul Manor is a complete mess.

412
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,970
He tried to die together with his enemies

413
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,770
and nearly burned up his very soul.

414
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,900
His body may be recovering now,

415
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,620
but his consciousness is fading away.

416
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,050
What does that mean?

417
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,420
It means he'll die!

418
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,580
So that master's medicine

419
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,690
can heal his body,

420
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,860
but not his soul?

421
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,100
Go inside his Soul Manor

422
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,010
and piece his soul back together.

423
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,620
Hurry!

424
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,290
Go!

425
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,490
Didn't you always say you wanted to kill Sima Jiao?

426
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,050
Why are you suddenly so concerned?

427
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,340
You think I want to save him?

428
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,690
I still haven't figured out how to separate from him.

429
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,940
If he dies now,

430
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,140
I die with him.

431
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,340
So hurry up and save him!

432
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,380
Easy for you to say.

433
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,380
Sima Jiao is at such a high realm.

434
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,450
If he doesn't open up his Soul Manor,

435
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,690
how am I supposed to get in?

436
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,770
Just try.

437
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,770
He's crazy about you, isn't he?

438
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,250
Maybe you can get in.

439
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,970
What makes you think that?

440
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,730
How could I not know how he feels?

441
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,580
Stop wasting time.

442
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,490
Get in already!

443
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,100
If you don't act fast, once his consciousness fades completely,

444
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,290
he'll really be gone!

445
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,660
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

446
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,180
How do I get into his Soul Manor?

447
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,250
Press your forehead to his.

448
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,010
Do it!

449
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,660
So this is Sima Jiao's Soul Manor?

450
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,250
Nothing?

451
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,380
Is his soul too damaged

452
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,210
to even fight back?

453
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,290
Grandmaster,

454
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,490
I'm here to save you.

455
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,490
Open the door, please.

456
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,340
Grandmaster?

457
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,530
Sima Jiao?

458
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,580
Jiao?

459
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,210
That was easy.

460
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,380
His Soul Manor is like the Mountain of Flames.

461
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,250
If I had to suffer like this all the time,

462
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,380
I'd go insane too.

463
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,770
He will live forever

464
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,940
in the agony of the Spirit Fire's burning.

465
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,730
I don't want him to live such a life.

466
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,180
Better to end

467
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,290
the Fengshan Clan's generations of tragedy here.

468
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,100
Jiao was born with this mission.

469
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,730
If you act recklessly, you might die!

470
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,290
Sima Jiao!

471
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,660
Why do these soul fragments

472
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,050
even carry emotions with them?

473
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,660
Sima Jiao, are you really this miserable?

474
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,100
I took you eating, drinking, and having fun.

475
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,140
Hasn't that cheered you up at all?

476
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,180
No...

477
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,580
No...

478
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,580
This is the soul core.

479
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,180
If it scatters,

480
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,660
he'll be completely annihilated.

481
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,450
No, stop.

482
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,940
Please stop.

483
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,620
No!

484
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,140
No...

485
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,450
How do I hold it together?

Sima Jiao,

508
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,620
am I going to die in your Soul Manor?

509
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,290
I'm already starting to forget who I am,

510
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,050
yet I can still clearly feel

511
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,420

if I don't want you to die,

00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,290

I...

524
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,210
He won't kill me when he wakes up, will he?

525
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,210
I told you you could do it.

526
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,010
His condition is much more stable now.

527
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,180
A few more tries and he'll be fine.

528
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,210
A few more tries?

529
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,530
That one nearly killed me already.

530
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,660
I thought barging in like that

531
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,290
would have damaged your soul,

532
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,620
but it seems

533
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,210
not only are you fine,

534
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,660
but you also came out with benefits.

535
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,250
Shut up, you little brat!

536
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,900
He's crazy about you, isn't he?

537
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,380
Maybe you can get in.

538
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,900
Grandmaster,

539
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,050
I'm here to save you.

540
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,010
Open the door, please.

541
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,420
Then why don't you tell me what you really think?

542
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,860
I want to hear the truth.

543
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,860
I'm doing this

544
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,940
because I cherish you so much

545
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,380
that I don't want you to be harmed in the slightest.

546
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,420
Maybe he really does like me

547
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,940
a little bit.

548
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,860
No...

549
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,820
I'm getting ahead of myself.

550
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,740
One of life's biggest illusions is thinking,

551
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,900
"He must like me."

552
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,860
Nine times out of ten, it's just wishful thinking.

553
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,220
Calm down...

554
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,940
He's at least

555
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,010
500 years old.

556
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,970
How could he possibly have feelings for me?

557
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,340
Even if I'm into him,

558
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,380
he won't care.

559
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,010
You, a lowly cultivator at the Foundation Rise realm,

560
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,700
think I am into you?

561
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,700
How laughable.

562
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,170
Thinking about romance day and night?

563
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,050
No wonder the people from your world

564
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,970
never make progress in cultivation.

565
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,490
But I can't just give up halfway, right?

566
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,570
Wouldn't that be a waste of effort?

567
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,860
All right,

568
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,450
I'll see this through to the end.

569
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,050
Liao Tingyan's Soul Manor

570
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,570
is so peaceful and pleasant.

571
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,380
I don't think I've ever really

572
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,300
looked closely at your face.

573
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,170
Most of my memory of your face

574
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,420
is still stuck on the day we first met.

575
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,220
Back then, the disciple beside me collapsed,

576
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,740
her blood splattering onto my dress and hands.

577
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,450
I immediately broke out in a cold sweat.

578
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,740
Later on,

579
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,010
as I saw you fight against more and more people,

580
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,650
I gradually learned

581
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,650
about your painful past.

582
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,450
The pain I've endured will be repaid.

583
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,610
Every bit of it.

584
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,050
Grandmaster,

585
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,780
so we've broken the seals, right?

586
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,010
Correct.

587
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,650
But my fear of you actually grew weaker.

588
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,130
Now, I'm not afraid of you at all.

589
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,450
Even though I think you'll lash out at me when you wake up,

590
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,650
to be honest,

591
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,700
I don't feel nervous at all.

592
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,130
You have such plump earlobes.

593
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,300
Why didn't that make you a man of good fortune?

594
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,260
You're awake.

595
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,820
It's hard to explain this to you right now.

596
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,010
That stupid flame

597
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,170
said it would take at least

598
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,900
three rounds of merging before he could wake up.

599
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,450
But it's only been two!

600
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,700
Can't it do basic math?

601
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,260
I think

602
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,300
I just had a very good sleep.

603
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,970
Maybe I had something to do with that.

604
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,820
The wounds on your chest are almost healed.

605
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,900
That pill really worked like a charm.

606
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,820
The best medicine

607
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,450
isn't the pill.

608
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,740
What...

609
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,860
