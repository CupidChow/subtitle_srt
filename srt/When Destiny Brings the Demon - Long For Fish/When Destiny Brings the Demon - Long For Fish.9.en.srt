Isn't this the flying pavilion I saw during the day?

111
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,610
Did I just check into a five-star hotel?

112
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,940
The view is amazing.

113
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,090
Did he put a bug on me or something?

114
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,260
How did he know I wanted to stay here?

115
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,180
Grandmaster.

116
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,690
You put together such a big setup,

117
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,420
yet you still couldn't defeat a mere spy from the Demon Realm.

118
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,610
It seems the Eight Palaces are due for new leaders.

119
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,380
Grandmaster, what do you mean by that?

120
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,810
Didn't you know Liao Tingyan

121
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,940
was from the Demon Realm?

122
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,420
Then who exactly did you prepare

123
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,970
all this for today?

124
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,900
We only just learned of it ourselves.

125
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,300
What do you intend to do with Liao Tingyan, Grandmaster?

126
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,780
Remove her tendons,

127
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,690
peel off her skin,

128
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,060
and break her bones.

129
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,090
I will imprison her first.

130
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,180
This place is wonderful.

131
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,420
I'd be happy to stay here for a month.

132
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,610
Then roast her flesh over fire.

133
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,300
A little more roasting and it'll be ready.

134
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,300
And throw her into a freezing cold pool to soak.

135
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,660
Is this paradise?

136
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,900
Finally, she will be devoured by beasts,

137
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,850

138
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,330
This really is a five-star hotel.

139

It's so comfortable.

140
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,940
And what about Liao Tingyan's body?

141
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,690
There will be no body.

142
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,690
Under such torture,

143
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,940
nothing will remain.

144
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,660
For a mere Demon Realm spy,

to die at the Grandmaster's hand

146
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,570
would be an honor.

147
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,490
Get lost.

148
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,330
Get lost!

149
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,420
Grandmaster,

150
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,810
Liao Tingyan may have committed grave crimes,

151
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,090
but she is still my disciple.

152
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,380
I beg you, Grandmaster,

153
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,540
let me bury her properly.

154
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,380
I already said there would be no body.

155
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,260

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,020
the Grandmaster killed that woman

158

159
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,060
Yes, that's what he said.

160
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,300
That's why we came to confirm.

161
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,300

Liao Tingyan is finally dead.

165
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,330
Chuhui, did you see something?

166
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,380
I took the Snow Goose Flying Pavilion

167
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,420
near White Deer Cliff.

168
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,490
The Grandmaster suddenly brought Liao Tingyan there

169
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,020
and treated her with extreme cruelty.

170
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,210
He even said the flying pavilion was perfect for killing someone.

171
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,570
What a lovely flying pavilion.

172
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,060
Perfect place to kill someone.

173
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,810
Liao Tingyan was scared stiff.

174
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,450
I offered to do it for the Grandmaster,

175
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,260
but it seemed he wanted to kill her himself.

176
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,850
So it's true?

177
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,020
I thought Sima Jiao was just tricking us.

178
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,660
There's no point in guessing.

179
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,140
One look at the life lamp, and we'll know.

180
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,090
Sect Master!

181
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,970
Sect Master, Liao Tingyan's life lamp

182
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,020
suddenly went out.

183
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,300
We can't summon her soul either.

184
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,810
Looks like that demon really is dead.

185
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,660
Even her soul is gone?

186
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,210
What a pity. Without Liao Tingyan as bait,

187
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,180
none of us can match the Grandmaster.

188
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,420
Of all times to die,

189
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,810
she had to die now.

190
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,690
I say we end the meeting here for today

191
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,180
and return to our palaces.

192
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,490
Hold on, everyone.

193
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,610
Sect Master Shi, do you still have doubts?

194
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,970
Everyone, you all saw with your own eyes

195
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,610
how the Grandmaster protected Liao Tingyan

196
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,090
the day he broke the seals.

197
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,970
How dare you act with such impudence before me?

198
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,210
What are you afraid of?

199
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,570
If I don't let you die,

200
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,180
you won't die.

201
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,060
He has been cruel since childhood, without exception to anyone.

202
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,490
Just because he protected someone before

203
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,940
doesn't mean he'll protect them now.

204
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,420
How about this?

205
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,210
To confirm the demon is truly gone,

206
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,260
I suggest you go

207
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,380
to White Deer Cliff once more.

208
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,610
If she is not dead,

209
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,420
then right now, she must think she has fooled us,

210
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,210
and her guard will be at its lowest.

211
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,690
If we search for her aura now,

212
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,660
we will surely find something.

213
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,020
That is easy for you to say, Sect Master Shi.

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,140
Tell me, who in the Gengchen Celestial Palace

215
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,210
would dare to trespass on the Grandmaster's territory?

216
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,210
Then I suppose Sect Master Shi

217
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,260
will have to do it himself.

218
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,810
I am willing to go to White Deer Cliff to investigate, Sect Master Shi.

219
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,490
Good. Master Yuan,

220
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,970
you must be very careful on this trip.

221
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,140
Don't worry, Sect Master.

222
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,610
I must report this matter to the Grandmaster at once.

223
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,180
Wait, Master Yuan.

224
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,940
Master Yuan,

225
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,020
I can't let you take such a risk alone.

226
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,690
I will bring a few disciples and go with you

227
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,260
to ensure nothing goes wrong.

228
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,060
Listen carefully:

229
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,780
once you enter White Deer Cliff,

230
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,490
search immediately for the Demon Realm spy's aura.

231
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,260
If you find her, capture her on the spot.

232
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,380
- Understood. - Understood.

Why are you really here?

237
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,660
To fix my sleep schedule and unwind.

238
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,180
In short, to take a vacation.

239
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,810
Don't you want to kill me?

240
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,570
No.

241
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,140
Why not?

242
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,380
I am just an innocent nobody.

243
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,690
But I thought of a way

244
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,450
that might cheer you up.

245
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,260
It worked!

246
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,210
I raised your realm,

247
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,610
and you use it for this?

248
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,060
It's cheered you up, hasn't it?

249
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,730

nor somewhere I even know well.

255
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,780
For no reason at all, I keep ending up

256
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,540
in life-threatening trouble.

257
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,450
Luckily, I have you, Grandmaster.

258
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,090
With your protection, I can live safely as a nobody,

259
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,810
even in a place this dangerous.

The Demon Realm spy's aura is inside!

263
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,100
Grandmaster.

264
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,380
Grandmaster, this...

265
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,580
What is this?

266
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,210
How dare you trespass?

267
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,100
Do you also want to know what it's like

268
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,620
to be wiped out without a trace?

269
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,340
Forgive us, Grandmaster.

270
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,970
I detected traces

271
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,180
of the Demon Realm spy's aura remaining

272
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,770
and was concerned for your safety,

273
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,970
so I came to report it.

274
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,450
Since you like to busy yourself so much,

275
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,900
come.

276
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,820
Clean this up.

277
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,770
Yes, Grandmaster.

278
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,770
This is the only thing in the room

279
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,210
that carries Liao Tingyan's aura.

280
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,490
It seems she really has been killed.

281
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,690
If you dare trespass again,

282
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,690
you will no longer be the Sect Master.

283
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,100
Understood.

284
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,010
Let's go.

285
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,100
Canglan, you schemed against me?

286
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,620
What did you do?

287
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,140
What's wrong?

288
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,210
What happened?

289
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,100
We can never return to the Demon Realm now.

290
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,450
Sima Jiao killed Liao Tingyan,

291
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,730
leaving no trace of her body.

292
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,250
Her body, her core...

293
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,420
Everything is gone.

294
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,210
What did you say?

295
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,770
Everyone heard it. Sima Jiao said it himself.

296
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,100
He only just realized Liao Tingyan was from the Demon Realm.

297
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,210
Then he killed her.

298
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,180
Even her life lamp has gone out.

299
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,140
Sima Jiao has saved Tingyan many times.

300
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,140
He's been with her constantly since ending seclusion.

301
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,860
Their bond could only have grown deeper.

302
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,970
Would he really have killed her in cold blood?

303
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,770
Ruling, now that Liao Tingyan is dead,

304
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,140
perhaps we should consider

305
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,530
shifting the target to Sima Jiao.

306
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,490
Absolutely not.

307
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,050
To act recklessly under the Grandmaster's nose

308
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,180
would only doom the entire Yin Palace.

309
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,970
What does the Yin Palace have to do with you?

310
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,580
Have you grown so attached to the palace mistress's seat

311
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,820
that you've forgotten Mother's dying wish

312
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,210
and the clansmen still waiting for you to take them home?

313
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,820
How dare you!

314
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,450
Madam,

315
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,620
the Black Serpent that follows the Grandmaster

316
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,620
is requesting an audience.

317
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,380
I will not see him.

318
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,210
Go and tell him

319
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,490
she will see him now.

320
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,730
Understood.

321
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,770
Father,

322
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,420
Sima Jiao is cruel and bloodthirsty.

323
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,580
Liao Tingyan was just a passing amusement for him.

324
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,340
It is no surprise he killed her.

325
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,140
Why are you still worried?

326
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,340
Do you think Sima Jiao has already figured out

327
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,900
that we plan to seal him?

328
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,050
If not, why didn't he attend the banquet at Serene Vale?

329
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,490
If he no longer cared about Liao Tingyan,

330
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,180
it makes sense that he didn't accompany her there.

331
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,340
If he did know about our plan,

332
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,050
he would have already gone berserk.

333
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,490
Until Sima Jiao

334
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,010
is sealed,

335
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,690
I cannot feel at ease.

336
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,380
Any news from Chiyan City?

337
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,730
Nothing yet.

338
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,250
But rest assured, Father.

339
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,770
Everything is proceeding as planned.

340
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,100
Ruling.

341
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,770
Ruling.

342
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,420
No.

343
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,490
Greetings, Madam Ye.

344
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,450
You may leave us.

345
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,860
What happened to Tingyan?

346
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,580
The Grandmaster didn't kill her, did he?

347
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,860
Let's sit and talk.

348
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,940
Come.

349
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,820
Ruling, I don't think Tingyan is dead.

350
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,770
Really?

351
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,970
Then where is she now?

352
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,970
She...

353
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,730
Well, I don't really know where she is now.

354
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,100
But I think the Grandmaster must've found a way

355
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,010
to keep her alive.

356
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,050
He simply doesn't want others

357
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,730
to know her whereabouts.

358
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,940
So you are saying Tingyan is not with the Grandmaster now?

359
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,100
In that case, I can rest easier.

360
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,050
Still, as a man,

361
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,340
you should not come here so often.

362
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,820
People will talk.

363
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,180
What are you doing?

364
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,660
Madam Ye,

365
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,290
please take me as your disciple.

366
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,490
This isn't a place for you to fool around.

367
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,450
Get up.

368
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,940
I am not fooling around.

369
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,770
Ruling,

370
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,620
if I become your disciple,

371
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,620
I will have a reason to see you every day,

372
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,770
and you won't

373
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,530
have to worry about gossip.

374
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,820
So please,

375
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,940
take me as your disciple.

376
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,970
You inherited the Grandmaster's spiritual power and techniques.

377
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,580
What could I possibly teach you?

378
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,580
How to be human.

379
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,380
And you think that is not fooling around?

380
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,380
I am serious.

381
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,770
As you know,

382
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,100
I have only just taken human form.

383
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,250
There are still so many, so many things

384
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,820
about being human that I need to learn.

385
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,100
So, will you be my master?

386
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,010
Please?

387
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,690
Please?

388
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,860
If I had that much time,

389
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,100
I could spend it on my own cultivation.

390
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,970
Why should I waste time teaching you?

391
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,100
Because

392
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,010
if I learn well,

393
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,490
I can become your capable aide,

394
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,380
and you can use me

395
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,820
to get what you want.

396
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,970
What do you mean by that?

397
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,580
I remember

398
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,420
Tingyan once said

399
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,100
you fought with everything you had to become the palace mistress

400
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,100
because there was power you wanted to gain,

401
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,620
things you wanted to accomplish,

402
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,660
and goals you wanted to achieve.

403
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,580
And I

404
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,210
can help you with all of that.

405
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,420
Ruling, he is Sima Jiao's guard.

406
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,490
You must make good use of this pawn.

407
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,580
Trust me.

408
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,690
All right. Come with me.

409
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,050
I will tell you

410
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,580
what I want to do.

411
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,620
Move it.

412
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,420
Get up!

413
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,770
Hurry!

414
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,450
They...

415
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,860
The people here

416
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,970
are all captives taken from the Demon Realm

417
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,380
during the Immortal-Demon War years ago.

418
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,970
They have almost no access to spiritual veins

419
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,010
and have to rely on their scant memories

420
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,140
of the Demon Race to cultivate.

421
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,530
So they are the poorest in cultivation

422
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,940
in the entire Yin Palace.

423
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,820
This

424
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,100
is also where I grew up.

425
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,290
How could this happen?

426
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,290
They are already people

427
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,770
of the Celestial Palace.

428
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,210
They shouldn't be abused like this in the Yin Palace.

429
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,010
Soon, there will be no more abuse.

430
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,340
I have negotiated with the elders for a long time

431
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,660
and finally brought them to abolish their slave status.

432
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,210
So today

433
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,900
is their last day in the Labor Camp.

434
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,290
Ruling,

435
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,100
you must have

436
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,140
suffered so much in the past.

437
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,340
Children, remember this.

438
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,050
No matter how difficult things become in the future,

439
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,180
you must find a way

440
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,210
to lead our people back to our homeland.

441
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,970
But at least

442
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,620
you have done

443
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,770
something great for your people.

444
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,490
But

445
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,250
for most of them,

446
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,420
if they can't return home

447
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,340
in the Demon Realm,

448
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,860
then it doesn't matter

449
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,580
where they live.

450
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,620
I brought you here to tell you

451
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,900
that letting my people

452
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,900
live the life they want

453
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,820
is my true wish.

454
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,490
I will help you.

455
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,050
Really?

456
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,340
Really.

457
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,770
You say you aren't used to being human and don't understand humanity,

458
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,690
but in my eyes,

459
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,580
you're actually more sincere than most people.

460
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,420
Really?

461
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,050
You're making me blush

462
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,970
with all that praise.

463
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,770
If you truly want to help me,

464
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,050
I should, of course, give you something in return.

465
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,340
What do you mean?

466
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,210
I'm willing to be your master.

467
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,050
Master.

468
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,450
I bow to you, Master.

469
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,140
All right.

470
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,050
Since I am now your master,

471
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,970
I will give you a name.

472
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,250
Okay.

473
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,210
Since you are a black serpent,

474
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,770
and the day you took human form was the twenty-ninth of the month,

475
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,100
I name you Hei Nianjiu. What do you think?

476
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,620
You actually remember the day I became human?

477
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,210
What's so hard about that?

478
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,420
Nianjiu...

479
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,860
I like this name.

480
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,100
I'm glad you do.

481
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,380
Grandmaster.

482
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,050
Why does he look so big?

483
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,210
Even his hand reaching toward me looks huge.

484
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,490
It's like he's a giant.

485
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,900
What is that?

486
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,380
Why have I turned into an otter?

487
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,690
Why did you turn me into this?

488
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,970
Change me back!

489
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,210
I want my long legs and pretty face back!

490
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,900
I didn't turn you into this.

491
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,940
You wanted to become this yourself.

492
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,140
Nonsense.

493
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,010
You sly fox, full of lies!

494
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,620
I fed you a Form-Changing Pill,

495
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,180
and it turned you

496
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,420
into the form you remembered most vividly in your heart.

497
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,420
[This otter is so good at playing cute.]

498
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,100
This otter looks so sleek and shiny.

499
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,010
It must feel amazing to pet.

500
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,180
Why, oh why?

501
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,860
I can't feel this great fur myself,

502
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,050
but instead, Sima Jiao gets to enjoy it.

503
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,900
The internet has ruined me...

504
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,940
Change me back!

505
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,940
The Form-Changing Pill

506
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,380
will keep you like this for three months.

507
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,860
Could you move your noble hand away?

508
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,660
I'm a person, not a body pillow, okay?

509
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,970
A body pillow?

510
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,660
Meaning a pillow to hold while you sleep?

511
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,730
That's a fine name.

512
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,530
Why did you feed me the Form-Changing Pill?

513
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,770
Because in the eyes of others,

514
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,140
you are already dead.

515
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,490
Otherwise, sooner or later,

516
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,940
you'd be killed by that traitor, Shi Qianlv.

517
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,940
Isn't he your guardian?

518
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,620
The respect he shows now

519
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,490
is just an act.

520
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,050
So you did this for my sake?

521
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,420
But turning me into an otter is going too far.

522
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,100
I think it's "schoolkid-ish."

523
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,490
That's not how you use that word.

524
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,900
Never mind.

525
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,100
If sleeping could raise your realm,

526
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,340
you'd be dominating the Gengchen Celestial Palace.

527
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,660
Where did this spirit pet come from?

528
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,450
The Grandmaster is so close to it.

529
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,490
Grandmaster, I have a new name now.

530
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,730
It's Hei Nianjiu.

531
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,450
Nice name!

532
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,690
Congrats, Nianjiu!

533
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,770
What are you squealing about, you little thing?

534
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,940
What's it to you?

535
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,580
Even with a new name, he's still the same dumb snake.

536
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,340
Grandmaster,

537
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,380
you value Tingyan greatly.

538
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,100
Surely you didn't really kill her, right?

539
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,900
I haven't even told her my new name yet.

540
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,970
If you don't find out what I told you to investigate soon,

541
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,820
I will kill you, too.

542
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,250
Spare me, Grandmaster.

543
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,210
I've already found that girl.

544
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,690
She's Anxue from the Yin Palace.

545
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,340
I asked Ruling about her.

546
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,530
She said

547
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,100
she hadn't seen Anxue for days.

548
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,010
But her life lamp is still lit,

549
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,250
so she should still be alive

550
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,940
and just hidden somewhere.

551
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,420
By the way,

552
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,340
I've brought many things

553
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,940
Anxue left in the Yin Palace.

554
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,660
Maybe some of them could be useful?

555
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,340
Neither erasing her memory nor killing her outright...

556
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,530
That's not Shi Qianlv's style.

557
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,820
What's so special about this Anxue

558
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,380
that he'd go to so much trouble?

559
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,380
Could it be that Shi Qianlv has taken a liking to Anxue

560
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,970
and has ulterior motives toward her?

561
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,380
You actually guessed it.

562
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,900
That shameless old fool.

563
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,050
You fool, this is something Shi Zhenxu has touched.

564
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,690
So it was Shi Zhenxu who hid Anxue away?

565
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,380
He's the one she's involved with?

566
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,690
Inject this strand

567
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,940
of spiritual power into Anxue's life lamp

568
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,340
and spread the word

569
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,860
that we are looking for her.

570
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,340
Understood.

571
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,250
Who knows?

572
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,690
Perhaps Shi Zhenxu is Shi Qianlv's weak point.

573
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,860
[The new Spirit Fire has taken shape.]

574
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,250
We did it!

575
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,210
The new Spirit Fire has taken shape!

576
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,380
Congratulations, Father.

577
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,770
Now that the Spirit Fire is ready,

578
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,770
we're one step closer to completing our plan.

579
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,380
We've reached a key turning point.

580
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,660
Hurry to Chiyan City.

581
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,860
Get them to speed things up.

582
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,690
Rest assured, Father.

583
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,580
I will not let you down.

584
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,420
[The new Spirit Fire has taken shape.]

585
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,380
Sima Jiao, your days are numbered.

586
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,660
Stay here for now.

587
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,900
Once Father's plan is fulfilled,

588
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,820
we will be together forever.

589
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,820
I'll wait for you to come back.

590
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,860
Goodbye.

591
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,940
Sect Master.

592
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,050
Do you know Sima Jiao is searching for you everywhere?

593
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,050
Zhenxu hasn't performed Soul Cleanse on you yet,

594
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,820
has he?

595
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,130
I will be extra careful in the coming days.

596
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,940
I won't let Sima Jiao find me.

597
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,010
Good.

598
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,610
Go now.

599
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,380
Thank you, Sect Master.

600
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,220
Only the dead

601
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,610
can never be found.

602
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,010
Grandmaster,

603
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,820
Anxue's life lamp went out.

604
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,530
Shi Qianlv killed her.

605
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,260
Looks like we won't be able to get any information from her.

606
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,970
If I want it,

607
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,820
even the dead can come back to life.

608
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,530
Grandmaster.

609
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,610
Still going to protect the one who killed you?

610
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,340
I only wished to be with Zhenxu forever.

611
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,860
Why did he kill me?

612
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,220
I will tell you whatever you want

613
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,650
to know, Grandmaster.

614
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,820
Please avenge me

615
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,610
and kill Shi Qianlv.

616
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,700
What exactly is Shi Qianlv plotting

617
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,220
with Shi Zhenxu?

618
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,570
I...

619
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,380
I don't know.

620
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,780
Where did Shi Zhenxu go?

621
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,170
Chiyan City.

622
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,740
To find someone with a flame-shaped birthmark on their back.

623
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,450
Why is he looking for such a birthmark?

624
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,010
Grandmaster, is she truly gone just like that?

625
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,940
Her soul was completely destroyed.

626
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,220
Even my spell

627
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,780
could only keep her here for a short while.

628
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,820
Shi Qianlv is so ruthless.

629
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,260
Now, I finally understand

630
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,420
what you meant when you said Shi Zhenxu

631
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,490
was Shi Qianlv's weak point.

632
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,490
Let's hear it.

633
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,420
You already knew Shi Qianlv was unhappy about Shi Zhenxu

634
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,050
being involved with Anxue,

635
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,700
so you had me spread the word

636
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,090
that we were looking for her,

637
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,530
knowing his dissatisfaction and resentment

638
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,300
would drive him to kill her.

639
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,780
When you had me inject your spiritual power

640
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,970
into Anxue's life lamp,

641
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,010
it was all in preparation for this day.

642
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,380
You're finally making some progress.

643
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,050
Grandmaster,

644
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,130
this is Tingyan's bed.

645
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,530
Nianjiu,

646
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,780
why do you look like you just lost a dear friend?

647
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,970
Grandmaster, you didn't really kill Tingyan, did you?

648
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,530
Grandmaster, hurry and tell him the truth.

649
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,490
If I didn't kill her,

650
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,820
others would have.

651
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,380
Death was inevitable for her.

652
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,820
Better to end her suffering early.

653
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,610
I don't believe it. You would never kill Tingyan.

654
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,340
You must have hidden her away to protect her,

655
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,820
right?

656
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,300
I can't let this thing

657
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,610
take the Grandmaster's attention away.

658
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,010
I have to do something.

659
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,490
How am I supposed to eat, drink, and have fun like this?

660
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,820
We will go on vacation somewhere else.

661
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,260
Where?

662
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,740
Somewhere more fun than the flying pavilion?

663
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,780
Yes.

664
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,610
You'll see.

665
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,340
Even though you turned me into an animal and keep petting me,

666
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,860
you did it to protect me.

667
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,530
Sima Jiao, I guess you're not completely heartless after all.

668
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,570
What's wrong with these puppet servants?

669
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,490
Are they broken?

670
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,860
These puppet servants

671
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,780
are all eyes for that old fool, Shi Qianlv.

672
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,300
You said it so calmly.

673
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,380
You knew from the start, didn't you?

674
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,570
If I hadn't left him a few flaws to find,

675
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,090
how else would he have lowered his guard?

676
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,570
How long will we be gone?

677
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,220
Will people find out?

678
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,530
I doubt they would dare

679
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,340
to trespass on White Deer Cliff again.

680
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,050
Grandmaster, I'm dull-witted.

681
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,420
I don't know how to have fun the way Tingyan did.

682
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,010
Don't mention that dead woman again.

683
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,010
Have you found who spread the news about Liao Tingyan?

684
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,970
Yes.

685
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,260
It was Anxue from the Three Saints Mountain.

686
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,650
She held a grudge against Tingyan,

687
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,530
so she must have

688
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,450
spread the news to take revenge.

689
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,780
But she's already dead,

690
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,860
so I couldn't get anything out of her.

691
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,570
Sima Jiao,

692
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,450
let's see how much longer you can act so arrogantly.

693
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,420
[Chiyan City]

694
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,220
Is Chiyan City the outer perimeter of the Gengchen Celestial Palace

695
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,740
you mentioned before?

696
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,820
That's right.

697
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,340
The inner area is where the main branches of the great clans reside.

698
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,450
It is rich in spiritual energy and ideal for cultivation.

699
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,530
The outer perimeter

700
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,780
is a gathering place

701
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,820
for smaller affiliated families,

702
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,650
mostly the families of the sect's disciples,

703
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,300
who have lived here for generations.

704
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,350
- Bravo! - Bravo!

705
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,260
There are also common people

706
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,940
who moved here for protection.

707
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,340
So here...

708
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:09,960
- Bravo! - Bravo!

709
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,610
...everyone's at a low realm.

710
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,940
- I see. - Wonderful!

711
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,670
Nice!

712
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,100
- Bravo! - Bravo!

713
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,560
Again!

714
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,960
- Bravo! - Bravo!

715
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,130
You have good taste, sir.

716
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,760
- Bravo! - Bravo!

717
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,820
It's been so long since I last saw this kind of street scene.

718
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,220
Did you live in a place like this before?

719
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,570
Sort of.

720
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,970
It feels a bit familiar.

721
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,780
We have business to attend to here.

722
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,420
If you like, you can eat

723
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,260
to your heart's content here.

724
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,380
- Great! - All right.

725
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,860
I was talking to the otter.

726
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,780
Grandmaster is so nice to that newcomer.

727
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,530
Why did something inside me just stir?

728
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,450
What is it trying to tell me?
