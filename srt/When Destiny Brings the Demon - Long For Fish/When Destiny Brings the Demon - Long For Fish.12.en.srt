22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,420
Pull yourself together.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,250
Your father has told us about Baifeng Mountain.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,700
My Grand...

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,010
My young master is very powerful.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,890
You can count on him to take care of things there

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,650
and ensure your safety.

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,220
We've already paved the way for you.

The Fengshan bloodline

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,060

into tragedy.

35
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,220
He's right.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,500
Grandmaster,

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,690
why don't you go check on Ms. Qing'er?

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,370
Please.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,940
After all,

40
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,300
you still haven't met your daughter.

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,090
You were the one who named her Yueqing.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,060
Don't you want to see her?

43
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,500
Yueqing?

44
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,180
My child?

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,540
Zhou Yueqing.

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,060
You gave her that name yourself.

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,340
Come with me. Meet her.

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,650
Thank you so much back there.

49
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,370
I will never forget this kindness.

50
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,970
I didn't do it for you.

51
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,410
I know.

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,740
To you,

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,220
it may have been nothing.

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,060
But to me,

55
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,940
it's a blessing for a lifetime.

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,250
What about Master Yan?

57
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,130
I'll take care of it.

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,340
Much obliged.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,620
Even though I can't shake off this settling feeling,

60
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,020
this is also the most at peace

61
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,340
I've felt in years.

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,810
Peace...

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,970
It feels like only recently

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,130
I've learned what peace means.

65
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,460
Congratulations.

00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,170

Huan!

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,370
Ms. Qing'er...

70
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,540
Look,

71
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,100
with the help of this young lady

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,660
and this gentleman,

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,810
I found us a home.

74
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,890
Do you like it, Huan?

75
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,570
Ms. Qing'er,

76
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,130
why waste your time on

77
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,890
someone like me?

78
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,740
Huan,

79
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,660
don't you want to hold our daughter?

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:52,940
Here.

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,100
Why are you crying?

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,500
The mood is so touching.

83
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,010
It feels rude not to cry.

84
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,420
Knowing that I helped make this happen

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,420
makes me feel pretty amazing.

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,300
Huan,

87
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,130
sit.

88
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,810
Huan,

89
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,250
the kind lady prepared

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,210
everything for us.

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,770
She helped us reunite with each other.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,300
Put her to sleep.

93
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,010
I'll go prepare some food and wine.

94
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,300
Tonight, we should celebrate.

95
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,980
Ms. Qing'er,

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,740
the way you are now

97
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,500
is different from when I first met you at the pleasure house.

98
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,810
Back then, your smile could topple a city,

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,810
your hands never did chores.

100
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,500
But now you're content with a quiet home,

101
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,250
and willing to cook and care for me.

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,130
Huan.

103
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,060
Don't make fun of me.

104
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,450
As long as I have you and Yue with me,

105
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,250
I'll be content anywhere.

106
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,060
Yue.

107
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,450
It's the first time we've met.

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,980
I want to keep you in my arms forever.

109
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,770
So this is the wondrous bond of blood and kinship.

110
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,690
Such a tiny being

111
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,620
has given me so much courage.

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,690
I don't want to go back there.

113
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,100
It's terrifying.

114
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,660
It's disgusting.

115
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,940
I am but a lifeless man.

116
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,450
I am nothing but a walking corpse.

117
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,180
Yue.

118
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,540
The two of us...

119
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,060
We need to find a place no one can ever reach.

120
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,370
Only then can we live a peaceful and happy life.

121
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,660
And we won't drag your mother down with us.

122
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,980
Will you come with me?

123
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,450
The Yan family's ill fate

124
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,210
should end with our generation.

125
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,980
Mr. Yan and Ms. Qing'er

126
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,890
finally got their happy ending.

127
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,810
You could say we've done a good deed.

128
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,330
Let's take it as building up our own blessings.

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,980
Do you really think

130
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,300
this peace will last?

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,210
Of course it will last.

132
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,330
Grandmaster,

133
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,970
a person's fate is in their own hands.

134
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,180
As long as we want to change,

135
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,420
we can alter our own destiny.

136
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,900
Do you know what destiny is?

137
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,210
Of course I do.

138
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,570
My destiny is

139
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,060
that I'm meant to live carefree,

140
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,780
eating, drinking, and having fun.

141
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,420
Yue! Huan!

142
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,020
Huan!

143
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,090
- Not another step! - Huan!

144
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,020
Huan!

145
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,850
Not another step!

146
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:08,970
Huan!

147
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,210
Stay away!

148
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,140
Yes, but calm down!

149
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,020
Stay away!

150
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,330
Huan!

151
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,660
Huan, don't do it!

152
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,690
- Ms. Qing'er, don't go! - Huan!

153
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,450
Huan!

154
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,660
Put Yue down now!

155
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,300
Ms. Qing'er...

156
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,610
A quick release is better than suffering.

157
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,090
No.

158
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,180
Please, no!

159
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,490
You have no idea

160
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,180
what life Yue would be forced to endure.

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,660
- Huan, stop! - Don't do this!

162
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,450
Huan, don't! Please!

163
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,900
- Ms. Qing'er! - No!

164
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,810
Calm down!

165
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,260
Ms. Qing'er...

166
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,330
Would you rather live in shame

167
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,850
than die with your head held high?

168
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,940
Huan.

169
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,940
Don't you dare touch my Yue!

170
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,380
Please, help us!

171
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,570
Save him!

172
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,260
Please!

173
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,780
Grandmaster!

174
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,690
I can't let him go on like this.

175
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,380
Better to end it now,

176
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,660
and stop the Fengshan curse once and for all.

177
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,940
Give her back to me!

178
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,810
- Huan! - Grandmaster, can't you save him?

179
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,060
You have the power.

180
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,420
You can save Mr. Yan and Yue!

181
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,420
Huan, please, calm down!

182
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,060
Grandmaster!

183
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,900
No one can save him.

184
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,490
Sir...

185
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,810
This is his fate.

186
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,900
- No! - But what about the child?

187
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,020
She's alive, she's her own person!

188
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,450
She deserves her own future.

189
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,450
She should be free to choose.

190
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,810

Ever since I opened my Soul Manor,

I've begun to feel

218

Yan Huan only lived for a little over twenty years,

226
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,690
For Yan Huan, death was release.

227

But for Grandmaster?

228
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,020
He must suffer even more than Yan Huan did.

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,210
Take my blood.

380
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,820
Who turned you into this?

381
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,210
He said if there is blood, then I get porridge.

382
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,970
Porridge.

383
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,250
Take my blood.

384
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,380
Take my blood.

385
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,450
Where is he?

386
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,100
I want porridge.

387
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,970
Tell me where the man is.

388
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,730
How many more

389
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,660
of the Fengshan clan are here?

390
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,490
I do not know either.

391
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,420
Every child

392
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,820
with a flame-shaped birthmark

393
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,210
is sent to Baifeng Mountain.

394
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:30,860
Go.

395
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,940
Go!

396
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,180
We can leave now!

397
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,250
You dare stand in my way?

398
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,580
We have an array against the Sima clan.

399
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,340
He will not gain any advantage.

400
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,290
Do you think you can save anyone?

401
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,860
All of their bodies are bound with restrictions.

402
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,970
Once this barrier is broken,

403
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,820
they will all die.

404
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,450
Stay here!

405
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,970
Come back!

406
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,860
Stop!

407
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,940
If you leave here, you will die!

408
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,050
That is still better than being livestock,

409
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,210
caged and eaten,

410
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,620
never seeing daylight again!

411
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,660
Come back!

412
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,490
Father, Sima Jiao has broken into Baifeng Mountain.

413
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,580
He may destroy our operation.

414
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,770
Quickly, go tell the palace heads.

415
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,730
Say that Chiyan City has sent a plea for help.

416
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,530
Sima Jiao has gone mad.

417
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,140
He burns Baifeng Mountain and seeks to slaughter Chiyan City.

418
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,730
Yes.

419
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,660
Zhenxu, set fire in Chiyan City.

420
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,490
Make the flames spread as much as possible.

421
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,340
Say it was done by Sima Jiao.

422
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,450
Sima Jiao.

423
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,620
You asked for it.

424
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,180
Greetings, Sect Master.

425
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,900
Now the Shi family and the palaces

426
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,420
seem intent on capturing Sima Jiao.

427
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,860
Perhaps we can use their hands

428
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,490
to take his life.

429
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,450
Has the news about Baifeng Mountain

430
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,450
reached the Eight Palaces?

431
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,580
Sect Master,

432
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,010
Master Yuan is ill and cannot come.

433
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,290
Madam Ye is missing.

434
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,010
The other palace heads are ready.

435
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,940
Ruling.

436
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,380
Shi Qianlv is gathering the palace heads and elders.

437
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,900
They must have found traces of the Grandmaster.

438
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,970
Ruling, watch them closely.

439
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,530
I will report to the Grandmaster.

440
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,860
Nianjiu, forgive me.

441
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,050
I can't let you inform Sima Jiao.

442
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,420
Very well, let us depart.

443
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,690
The palaces and the Shi family

444
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,420
will join forces against Sima Jiao.

445
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,970
This may be the best chance for me and my people

446
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,660
to return to the Demon Realm.

447
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,180
[Yan Residence]

448
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,140
What are you looking at, you filthy brat?

449
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,050
Annoying kid.

450
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,620
Fire! Run!

451
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,730
What fire! What's happening?

452
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,490
What's going on?

453
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,490
Run!

454
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,050
Is the Grandmaster in trouble?

455
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,100
No, I must go find him!

456
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,940
My child!

457
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,340
My child!

458
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,620
The glory and wealth of the Yan family!

459
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,250
A sea of purgatory flames...

460
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,730
Master Yan!

461
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,420
I must find Sima Jiao.

462
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,130
As long as I exist,

463
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,780
the fate of the Sima bloodline can't be changed.

464
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,380
If one day

465
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,700
the Fengshan Spirit Fire no longer exists in this world,

466
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,420
then perhaps the Sima clan

467
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,450
may finally be freed.

468
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,260
May you be born

469
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,170

470
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,860

471
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,490
How did you end up like this?

472
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,610
I am dying.

473
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,130
Now is not the time to joke.

Since the day I was born,

475
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,900
many have wanted to kill me.

476
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,010
They wanted my life.

477
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,490
But I wouldn't give it to them.

478
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,610

I can give it to you.
