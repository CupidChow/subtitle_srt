00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,250
But I heard

192
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,460
she killed her fiancé, Lord of Mercy,

193
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,940
to seize his Spirit Fire.

194
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,010
That Lord of Mercy was feared by all.

195
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,220
To kill him

196
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,060
shows the ruler was even more ruthless.

197
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,220
Truly terrifying.

198
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,980
It's good they fear her.

199
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,890
After hearing she killed Lord of Mercy,

200
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,860
those with scheming hearts

201
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,980
never dared turn disloyal.

202
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,730
Exactly.

203
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,770
Besides, the ruler cares for the people,

204
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,820
with the world in her heart.

205
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,010
Everyone can see that.

206
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,580
Sir,

207
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,700
which side do you think

208
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,860
is the true ruler?

209
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,530
Yes, sir.

210
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,610
That's for the people of both realms to judge.

211
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,100
I only know she's done much

212
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,580
to merge the realms

213
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,250
and bring peace,

214
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,300
with great results.

215
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,730
Senior Li, Senior Gu.

216
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,010
You're finally here!

217
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,130
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

218
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,340
We've developed some new spells this time.

219
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,770
We want to discuss them with you.

220
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,890
Now that the Immortal-Demon Barrier between realms is gone,

221
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,340
travel is easy,

222
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,700
and yet you arrive only now!

223
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,820
We just wanted to prepare properly

224
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,940
before coming to study.

225
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,460
Alright.

226
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,940
Let's talk at my residence.

227
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,730
Fine, let's go!

228
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,730
- Please! - After you!

229
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,770
Let's go home.

230
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,610
Okay, Mother.

231
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,180
Careful.

232
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,820
Just follow the prescription.

233
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,490
Thank you!

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,250
My head hurts.

235
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,940
Here, Madam.

236
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,460
Nothing serious.

237
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,770
Here's your prescription.

238
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,180
And a subsidy for your medicine.

239
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,460
I came to get medicine and ended up with gems?

240
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,890
Before this, such things were unbelievable.

241
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,980
Thank you so much!

242
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,890
Please, have a seat.

243
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,340
Master Yuan,

244
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,530
did you secretly stay up

245
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,530
working on papers again last night?

246
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,250
I had nothing to do yesterday,

247
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,890
so I drafted the next five days' papers

248
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,100
ahead of time.

249
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,130
The rule I set for both realms

250
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,130
is an eight-hour workday.

251
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,940
If you don't lead by example,

252
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,220
how can the people follow?

253
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,580
Abide by the law.

254
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,700
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

255
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,100
I admit my mistake.

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,220
You all heard it.

257
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,860
Anyone breaking the eight-hour rule

258
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,980
will lose half a year's salary.

259
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,340
We obey!

260
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,940
If there's nothing else, court is dismissed.

261
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,460
Long live Your Majesty!

262
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,410
Sleeping so soundly.

263
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,650
Did you dream of something sweet?

264
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,930
Where have you been all these years?

265
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,610
Sima Jiao?

266
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,540
Sima Jiao.

267
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,740
Sima Jiao!

268
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,500
♪I'm unafraid though memories are gone♪

269
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:26,060
♪Through karma's journey, all lifetimes share one gaze♪

270
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,220
♪I believe in each life we'll fall in love again♪

271
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,140
♪Through every trial we've endured...♪

272
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,060
You said this tree's scent

273
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,410
calms the heart

274
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,740
and suppresses the turmoil inside, liar!

275
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,860
It just makes me dream of you every day,

276
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,540
unable to forget you!

277
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,140
♪Awakened memories will never fade again...♪

278
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,020
Back then,

279
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,860
you suffered the burning of the Spirit Fire like this,

280
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,930
yet always pretended you were fine.

281
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,970
Such heavy worries

282
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,260
will harm Her Majesty's health.

283
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,690
Back then,

284
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,580
Grandmaster burned his own flesh and soul

285
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,690
to purify Yan's inner core,

286
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,100
injecting the refined Spirit Fire into her body,

287
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,020
securing her place as today's Immortal-Demon Ruler.

288
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,370
How could she ever forget that?

289
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,820
The Grandmaster gave his love.

290
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,260
The Ruler returned it with devotion.

291
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,020
He refined the Spirit Fire with his very being

292
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,740
to cleanse her demon core,

293
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,100
losing his cultivation and his soul.

294
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,500
To give him a chance to survive,

295
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,970
she forcibly preserved a wisp of his soul,

296
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,500
using secret arts to transfer it and grant his rebirth.

297
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,100
But without his complete soul as a guide,

298
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,340
the demon core inside her

299
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,540
could never be fully removed.

300
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,020
And so,

301
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,930
she suffers the Spirit Fire's torment day and night.

302
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,890
The Grandmaster's soul was burned to a single wisp,

303
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,650
and with no suitable vessel nearby,

304
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,970
she could not fuse it.

305
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,300
She had to release that wisp of soul

306
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,340
back into the world,

307
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,130
to find its own path.

308
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,650
Even now, Yan doesn't know

309
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,690
where her Grandmaster is.

310
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,130
Preceptor,

311
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,340
she must drink this medicine.

312
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,890
We can't ease her grief,

313
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,370
but at least

314
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,650
it can ease her pain.

315
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,690
Now the world is peaceful,

316
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,580
the quiet I longed for.

317
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,370
Sima Jiao,

318
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,100
if only you were here.

319
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,740
You're here, Preceptor.

320
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,260
I'll make sure you drink it.

321
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,370
Your master said

322
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,890
this medicine is for the burning pain inside you.

323
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,610
It only works if you take it regularly.

324
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,100
Come on.

325
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,890
It barely works.

326
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,210
Every month there are days of pain.

327
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,690
It's not just for pain relief.

328
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,690
The demon core inside you is suppressed,

329
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,780
but it still troubles you.

330
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,300
This medicine can calm your mind.

331
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,170
Drink it, come on.

332
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,820
Alright.

333
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,370
Bitterness always ends with sweetness.

334
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,170
Since I'm being so obedient,

335
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,130
let's go feast on Yan City's food street!

336
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,690
Eating again?

337
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,410
- Try it! - Freshly grilled skewers!

338
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,410
Come, take a look!

339
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,410
All the things you left me,

340
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,540
I like them all.

341
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,300
But without you,

342
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,780
what meaning do they have?

343
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,540
Look.

344
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,130
Your exchange program really worked

345
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,970
in bringing realms together.

346
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,970
Look at this street now.

347
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,860
Immortals and demons live like family,

348
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,820
don't they?

349
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,890
How about this place to eat?

350
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,130
Sure.

351
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,690
Let's go.

352
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,650
Sir,

353
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,300
we haven't even ordered.

354
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,580
Did you serve the wrong table?

355
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,100
With Your Majesty's presence,

356
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,210
these are free dishes from our shop.

357
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,060
Please enjoy.

358
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,930
Your shop's so small,

359
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,210
and you send out so many dishes.

360
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,500
How will you make money today?

361
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,020
I'll pay.

362
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,740
No!

363
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,020
Your light taxes

364
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,650
already help small shops

365
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,820
like ours.

366
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,780
These few dishes are just respect.

367
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,540
Please enjoy.

368
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,690
I already treat people kindly,

369
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,690
yet when they look at me,

370
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,170
it's like they've seen a demon.

371
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,860
You have to understand.

372
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,970
After all,

373
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,170
your killing of Sima Jiao is known everywhere,

374
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,340
and now you've merged with the Spirit Fire.

375
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,540
All he planned

376
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,340
was to keep everyone too scared to cross me.

377
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,930
If he can see

378
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,650
you're ruling both realms

379
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,860
so well,

380
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,610
he'll be at peace.

381
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,860
Enough talk. Drink up.

382
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,580
Preceptor Hongluo, you're so diligent

383
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,410
and selfless.

384
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,540
Exactly.

385
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,060
Haven't seen you with Nianjiu lately.

386
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,540
Him?

387
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,340
How can I ever get

388
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,820
a big shot like him?

389
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,890
These days he's all secretive,

390
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,340
not even a shadow to be seen.

391
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,890
When I look for him, he's "too busy."

392
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,170
Or we're together fine one moment,

393
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,020
the next he's suddenly gone.

394
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,060
It makes no sense.

395
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,820
Where's he gone?

396
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,450
Haven't you asked him?

397
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,860
Of course I did.

398
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,580
He won't say.

399
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,100
Every time I see him, I get mad.

400
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,500
If he isn't guilty,

401
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,860
why be so sneaky all the time?

402
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,860
What's going on with him?

403
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,210
Didn't he just propose to you days ago?

404
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,930
Well,

405
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,690
forget it.

406
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,890
No!

407
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,970
I've watched you two fall in love for two lifetimes.

408
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,930
You can't just end it like this.

409
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,100
I'll vent your anger for you.

410
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,100
I'll go talk to him.

411
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,260
Drink up!

412
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,740
Tingyan.

413
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,930
What are you doing?

414
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,100
You scared me.

415
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,690
So you do know fear.

416
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,890
Tell me,

417
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,130
you keep sneaking around lately,

418
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,860
where've you been?

419
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,020
Chi Anhe said

420
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,820
you've been neglecting your duties,

421
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,020
even leaving Hongluo behind.

422
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,500
I never abandoned Hongluo.

423
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,500
But she wants to drop you now.

424
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,410
She thinks you've been unfaithful

425
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,610
and sent me to cut ties with you.

426
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,300
Hongluo misunderstood me.

427
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,500
I'll explain to her right away.

428
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,970
How about you explain it to me first?

429
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,450
Explain what?

430
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,540
I... I can't say.

431
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,970
Forcing me to fight, huh?

432
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,860
If I find

433
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,060
another girl's scent on you,

434
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,060
you're done!

435
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,370
Why do you carry Sima Jiao's aura?

436
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,500
What?

437
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,300
You've known where Sima Jiao was all along?

438
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,970
And you kept it from us this whole time?

439
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,820
Yes...

440
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,890
Nineteen years ago,

441
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,170
before Grandmaster went into seclusion to refine the Spirit Fire,

442
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,410
he told me

443
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,210
where I could find him, if Tingyan

444
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,020
was willing to keep his soul.

445
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,340
Grandmaster

446
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,300
seemed to have something to finish,

447
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,970
but never told me.

448
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,210
But we failed to give him

449
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,820
the Soul-Restoring Pill in time.

450
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,740
So he should have lost all memory by now.

451
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,170
How could he follow the old plan?

452
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,970
Maybe

453
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,860
Grandmaster has his own way.

454
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,100
We can restore his memories

455
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,890
through cultivation.

456
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,340
Then we'll know everything!

457
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,100
No.

458
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,300
He hasn't even come of age yet.

459
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,930
Tingyan,

460
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,970
his soul right now

461
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,580
can't bear the weight of old memories.

462
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,340
I once suggested to him

463
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,740
that he tell me

464
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,930
what he want to do,

465
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,340
every single thing.

466
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,130
And when I find you again, I'll tell you then.

467
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,890
But Grandmaster said

468
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,860
even without old memories,

469
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,930
he wouldn't believe someone else's words.

470
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,930
If I went and told him,

471
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,370
it would only make him wary.

472
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,450
At least he knows what he's like.

473
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,130
Tingyan, don't be mad.

474
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,060
Grandmaster truly didn't want you to worry.

475
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,370
How can I not worry?

476
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,020
Either way I'll worry.

477
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,370
You might as well tell me where he is!

478
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,060
Tell me, where is he now?

479
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,540
Right now,

480
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,100
he's in the mortal realm.

481
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,890
Nineteen years ago,

482
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,210
Grandmaster was born as a prince of Hu Kingdom.

483
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,970
But he ascended the throne as a child,

484
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,970
unable to govern.

485
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,650
Many sought his life

486
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,060
to seize the throne.

487
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,500
[Marquis of Nanyan]

488
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,650
Mercy, Your Majesty!

489
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,930
Mercy!

490
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,780
Silence!

491
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,780
How dare you act so clumsy before the Emperor!

492
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,580
Guards!

493
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,610
Drag him out!

494
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,820
Mercy, Your Majesty!

495
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,340
- Mercy! - That's why I must often go to the mortal realm

496
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,690
to protect Grandmaster's safety.

497
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,450
That guy really is something.

498
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,610
Wherever he goes, he's like royalty.

499
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,740
He actually became an emperor in the mortal world.

500
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,450
So, the task he wants to finish

501
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,020
requires him to be emperor?

502
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,210
I don't know.

503
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,100
Just recently,

504
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,610
Grandmaster visited Liyang County in secret,

505
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,540
but was ambushed by bandits.

506
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,100
So I went to protect him.

507
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,060
Hongluo,

508
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,820
that's why

509
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,410
I missed our meeting.

510
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,500
You could've just told me sooner.

511
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,410
Grandmaster didn't allow it.

512
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,340
Fine.

513
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,450
Then I want to see how he rules a kingdom.

514
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,610
Tingyan,

515
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,580
you can't just go to the mortal realm.

516
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,780
Hu Kingdom has almost no spiritual energy.

517
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,100
There aren't even basic sects there.

518
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,780
They're all mortals.

519
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,060
For them,

520
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,260
cultivators like us are just legends.

521
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,170
Many have never even heard of us.

522
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,170
Get to the point.

523
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,260
In the mortal realm,

524
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,020
the stronger your power, the greater the limits.

525
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,970
Tingyan,

526
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,690
right now you're the most powerful cultivator

527
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,450
in existence.

528
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,820
Which means the restrictions on you will be greatest.

529
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,860
There,

530
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,890
you can only use the most basic spells.

531
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,300
Otherwise, you'll suffer terribly,

532
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,890
even face backlash.

533
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,580
Doesn't matter.

534
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,410
I'm used to being mortal.

535
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,860
There's more!

536
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,410
You Yan might've used the body from Bi'an

537
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,540
to return to this world.

538
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,580
What?

539
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,780
Fengshan blood can nourish his soul.

540
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,340
Besides,

541
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,100
Bi'an's been gone so long without a trace.

542
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,260
I fear...

543
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,540
Tingyan,

544
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,860
Grandmaster was truly worried about you.

545
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,780
That's why he never told you all this.

546
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,300
And right now, no one knows

547
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,410
if You Yan hides in the both realms or among mortals.

548
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,370
So you must be extremely careful this trip.

549
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,580
Alright, I know.

550
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,410
- I'll go with you! - Also!

551
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,860
You mustn't let them know who you are...

552
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,650
- Got it! - or the mortal realm will fall into chaos.

553
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,740
It'll be even worse!

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,940
[Liyang County, Hu Kingdom]

555
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,300
I just heard the news.

556
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,100
Sima Jiao here is said to be cruel and lustful.

557
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,970
With plenty of concubines,

558
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,610
he must be a foolish ruler.

559
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,130
You should be prepared.

560
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,060
Get out!

561
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,930
Now!

I, Wei Xianyu, Governor of Liyang County, greet Your Majesty.

565

I thought this place was too complex.

566
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,820
Your Majesty's life is priceless.

567
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,370
With only one eunuch by your side,

568
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,020
it's unfit for you to stay in this brothel.

569
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,300
To be safe,

570
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,650
I came to escort Your Majesty back.

571
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,100
Even when Sima Jiao was Grandmaster,

572
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,170
outsiders called him brutal.

573
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,300
But that was just the surface.

574
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,130
As for lust...

575
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,580
his throne isn't steady now.

576
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,340
He probably needs marriages to win over officials.

577
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,500
Whatever he is in this life,

578
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,540
I'll accept it.

579
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,060
I just want him alive.

580
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,930
Your Majesty,

581
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,650
what have I done wrong

582
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,100
to anger you?

583
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,100
Your presence here alone

584
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,020
angers me.

585
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,890
Guards.

586
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,260
Drag him out and execute him in the street.

587
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,690
Your Majesty!

588
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,020
Spare me!

589
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,820
- Look, an execution! - Move aside!

590
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,370
Don't crowd around!

591
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,260
Move aside! No watching!

592
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,780
Who is that?

593
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,300
Move aside!

594
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,340
Everyone, move aside!

595
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,780
Isn't that the county governor?

596
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,130
Why is he being dragged by his own guards?

597
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,820
Yeah.

598
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,100
Life and death in the mortal world follow fate.

599
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,130
Best not meddle.

600
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,740
Who else can execute a governor in public?

601
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,540
You mean

602
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,170
the Grandmaster Emperor in disguise?

603
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,540
Could be.

604
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,370
If we save him,

605
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,540
maybe he'll lead us to Sima Jiao.

606
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,050
Your Majesty.

607
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,570
Everything is arranged?

608
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,300
Reporting to Your Majesty,

609
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,410
we sent men to rescue Wei Xianyu during the execution.

610
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,260
By now they should've succeeded,

611
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,930
and are on their way back to report.

612
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,660
Frankly, killing Wei Xianyu outright won't be wrong.

613
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,890
That bandit raid the other day

614
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,010
was his doing too.

615
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,820
Too bad he escaped.

616
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,970
He's already grown disloyal.

617
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,970
Sooner or later, he was bound to strike again.

618
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,490
Now if I give him another chance,

619
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,570
we can use him

620
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,140
to catch the Marquis of Nanyan.

621
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,860
Years ago, Wei Xianyu made his fortune

622
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,570
by hoarding grain during Yan Prefecture's drought.

623
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,930
Later he embezzled soldiers' pay,

624
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,820
seized land and killed innocents.

625
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,700
He's got plenty of dirty dealings.

626
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,260
How could a mere county governor

627
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,050
pull all this off?

628
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,450
Of course it was under the orders

629
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,930
of that old fox, the Marquis of Nanyan.

630
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,050
Exactly.

631
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,090
The Marquis has had wild ambitions.

632
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,820
Since Your Majesty's childhood,

633
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,860
he's held court power and the imperial guards,

634
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,570
weakening your influence,

635
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,780
leaving you to inherit the throne in a tight spot.

636
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,050
Since you were young,

637
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,090
assassins have come after you countless times,

638
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,970
even leaving you with a head illness.

639
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,450
Truly bitter.

640
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,260
Bitter or not,

641
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,700
someone has to guard

642
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,340
Hu Kingdom's land.

643
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,780
Your coming of age is near.

644
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,530
Then comes the rite that affirms your rule.

645
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,450
By then,

646
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,090
the ambitious will be forced to hold back.

647
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,570
- Kill him! - Kill him!

648
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,340
What are you doing?

649
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,930
See,

650
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,930
you've been hit by backlash.

651
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,260
Reflex.

652
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,410
Don't use your power so rashly.

653
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,140
I'll handle it.

654
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,010
- Kill him! - Kill him!

655
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,450
Why do they want to kill you?

656
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,930
Who gave the order?

657
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,820
It...

658
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,970
it was His Majesty.

659
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,220
Your Majesty.

660
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,410
I waited at the dock,

661
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,530
ready to rescue Wei Xianyu during the execution.

662
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,890
But suddenly my vision blurred.

663
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,300
When it cleared,

664
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,530
- Wei Xianyu had already been taken. - Kill him!

665
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,690
Kill him!

666
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,340
Hurry and find out who did it!

667
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,180
Yes, sir!

668
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,570
Bring me that woman in orange.

669
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

670
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,660
Ladies, please stay.

671
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,370
Such beauty and elegance,

672
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,700
no wonder.

673
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,860
My lord saw you

674
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,300
from afar at the tavern,

675
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,140
and couldn't get you out of his mind.

676
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,890
So he sent us to invite you.

677
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,260
Please come meet him.

678
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,820
I see.

679
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,780
We've run into a lecher,

680
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,930
sending his men to grab women.

681
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,220
Don't be rude!

682
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,970
My lord means no offense,

683
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,700
only wishes to speak with you at Songbird Pavilion.

684
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,930
Is your lord Sima Jiao?

685
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,490
How dare you call him by name!

686
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,140
How do you know?

687
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,450
Songbird Pavilion...

688
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,780
Sima Jiao, you scoundrel!

689
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,570
Don't lose your temper.

690
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,820
How can I not?

691
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,490
He's not only got concubines, brothels,

692
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,300
now he sends men to snatch girls off the street!

693
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,260
Didn't you just say

694
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,740
you'd accept him no matter what,

695
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,970
as long as he's alive?

696
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,490
Not anymore.

697
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,180
My standards just shot up.

698
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,860
Alright.

699
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,490
Now that we've found him,

700
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,490
I'll head back to Yan City.

701
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,490
The rest is up to you.

702
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,860
Just say I went into seclusion.

703
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,490
Affairs of state will be handled by my Preceptor.

704
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,260
Please, lead the way.

705
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,180
This way.

706
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,970
Miss...

707
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,880
[Yi Huo, Imperial Physician]

708
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,620
Miss Yi Huo.

709
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,820
On the Marquis's order, I'm here to deliver a message.

710
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,410
Since the bandit plot failed,

711
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,340
you must act again quickly.

712
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,570
If Sima Jiao returns to court,

713
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,010
we'll lose the chance.

714
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,620
Since Sima Jiao shows no mercy,

715
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,620
I won't hold back either.

716
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,570
At this point,

717
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,740
we can only strike at the root.

718
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,140
Please tell the Marquis:

719
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,660
this time I will succeed,

720
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,970
and help him kill Sima Jiao!

721
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,490
Why would the aura of demon core

722
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,050
and Spirit Fire appear here?

723
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,490
Liao Tingyan has merged with the Spirit Fire?

724
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,010
Why did she come to the mortal world?

725
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,370
No matter.

726
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,860
The timing is perfect.

727
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,660
I've rested for over a decade.

728
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,180
It's about time

729
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,930
I met some folks.

730
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,140
Have you found her?

731
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:33,970
Yes.
