22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,010
Grandmaster.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,340
Grandmaster, are you all right?

24
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,370
Is the Spirit Fire inside you restless again?

25
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,940
Have you found Shi Qianlv?

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,860
He...

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,620
he escaped.

28
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,420
Then why are you back here?

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,940
Grandmaster, look.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,130
Ye Ruling?

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,130
She was Hongluo,

32
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,340
the girl killed by those two

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,690
from the Zhihun clan.

34
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,970
So she ended up in the Demon Realm as well.

35
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,690
Grandmaster,

36
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,340
have you heard?

37
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,130
The people at Rouge Terrace said

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,410
they found her by Yin-Yang Lake.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,300
And they told me

40
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,250
she was carrying the tube whistle I gave her.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,530
Grandmaster,

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,970
I finally got word of her,

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,220
but then I instantly lost her again.

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,940
Does this mean

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,780
I will never see her again?

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,090
Her soul has been transferred.

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,250
You guarded the rite.

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,940
Really?

49
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,500
When I stood guard over the Soul Transfer,

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,850
all I found was a handful of ashes.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,650
I never knew

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,300
that was her.

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,970
But

54
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,650
don't be too quick to rejoice.

55
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,570
When I performed the Soul Transfer Spell for her,

56
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,130
I found that her soul was badly damaged.

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,620
The memories of when she was Ye Ruling

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,250
may never return.

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,220
Grandmaster, are you saying

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,530
that she

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,300
may not remember me?

62
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,340
She may even treat your devotion

63
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,940
as nothing,

64
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,980
leaving you in pain.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,010
Even though none of this

66
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,570
has happened yet,

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,690
your words

68
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,740
already make my heart ache.

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,690
As long as she remains alive,

70
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,620
no matter how much it hurts you,

71
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,890
you must endure it.

72
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,420
You are right, Grandmaster.

73
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,940
What matters most

74
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,010
is that she remains alive.

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,660
Move it.

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,660
Keep up.

77
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,180
Hurry.

78
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,210
Move it!

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,060
Move!

80
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,890
- Keep up. - Qianlv,

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,130
people from the Demon Realm and Sima Jiao's men

82
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,180
are all looking for us.

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,950
Hurry up!

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,540
If Liao Tingyan doesn't act soon,

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,060
are we just going to wait for death?

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,690
Avoid that squad of ghost envoys.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,570
Hurry!

88
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,660
Greetings, Preceptor.

89
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,690
Routine inspection.

90
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,500
Who is in the carriage?

Qianlv...

92
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,860
Go on.

93
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,130
Yes.

94
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,210
That man once held power in the Celestial Palace.

95
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,130
He has some cunning.

96
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,330
But look at him now.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,100
How laughable.

98
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,540
Preceptor,

99
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,420
why did you let him go?

100
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,010
I've heard Liao Tingyan has called him Father these past 18 years,

101
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,690
believing he was her savior.

102
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,940
He's also the one who knows her history

103
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,540
in the Celestial Palace best.

104
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,010
I'm letting him live.

105
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,330
Perhaps one day he'll be of use to me.

106
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,210
But what if he doesn't repay the favor?

107
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,330
I don't need him to.

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,330
Once he is driven to a dead end,

109
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,540
he will swallow his pride.

110
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,540
Keep a close watch on him.

111
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,940
Understood.

112
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,450
We're lucky they didn't realize

113
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,620
we were from the Celestial Palace.

114
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,010
That was Mingli, the Preceptor of the Demon Realm.

115
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,660
With his cultivation, he surely saw

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,740
our true identity.

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,540
Then why did he let us go?

118
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,540
Perhaps he has an ulterior motive.

119
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,810
Hey, you.

120
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,940
Stop.

121
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,890
Why are you still here?

122
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,690
Your Grandmaster said

123
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,890
I could stay.

124
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,210
Listen up.

125
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,180
You're only still alive

126
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,690
because our Grandmaster cares

127
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,180
about Tingyan's feelings.

128
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,450
You should be keeping your head down.

129
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,490
How dare you strut around like this?

130
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,490
Listen.

131
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,570
From now on, you are not to appear before Tingyan again.

132
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,330
Fine.

133
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,330
But Yan loves the food I make.

134
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,970
If she can't have it, she'll grow restless

135
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,140
and have trouble sleeping.

136
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,490
If she falls ill because of this, who will take responsibility?

137
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,690
Are you saying

138
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,380
she can't do without you?

139
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,300
It seems that way.

140
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,180
You are too dangerous

141
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,570
for her.

142
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,780
I'm staying by her side

143
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,780
to shield her from you.

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,260
She and I are cultivation partners.

145
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,380
You

146
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,570
are nothing but a clown.

147
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,660
Still,

148
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,180
these do smell nice.

149
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,060
Don't flatter yourself.

150
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,970
This is nothing.

151
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,210
Our Grandmaster can get Tingyan

152
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,300
whatever she wants to eat.

153
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,380
Grandmaster,

154
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,850
even if you don't kill him,

155
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,660
you can't let him act so arrogantly.

156
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,730
Someone like him

157
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,780
is not worth my anger.

158
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,810
I won't take him seriously.

159
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,210
But Grandmaster,

160
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,780
you don't really seem

161
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,260
like you're not angry.

162
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,610
Let's go.

163
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,900
Your spells are getting stronger.

164
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,020
Have you been practicing in secret?

165
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,210
Of course not.

166
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,900
Come on.

167
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,540
I know you love training.

168
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,570
Again.

169
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,810
Love it? I'm forced into it.

170
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,850
What?

171
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,060
Nothing. Let's keep going.

172
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,060
It's already dark.

173
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,610
Go back and rest.

174
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,260
I'll scout outside to see

175
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,490
if there are any gaps in the defenses

176
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,730
and prepare for our departure.

177
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,610
All right.

178
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,020
Why doesn't Feng Qi listen?

179
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,570
I told him to leave, but he just won't.

180
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,260
Every day, he drags me to train like he's on stimulants.

181
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,970
I only train for self-defense,

182
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,180
not because I like it.

183
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,690
When did you come in?

184
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,730
Let me take you somewhere.

185
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,450
Why can't I ever say no to him?

186
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,060
[Central Tower, Winter City Lord Residence]

187
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,420
Why does it feel like I've been here before?

188
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,260
You remember?

189
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,020
No.

190
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,090
I just feel

191
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,690
like I saw it in a dream.

192
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,450
That was no dream.

193
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,260
This is where we first met.

194
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,420
I'm exhausted.

195
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,180
Can't walk anymore?

196
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,810
Grandmaster,

197
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,900
forgive me for asking,

198
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,490
but why are we

199
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,300
climbing so high?

200
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,300
No reason.

201
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,900
Back then, when you climbed these stairs,

202
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,140
you nearly collapsed.

203
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,210
I had never met anyone

204
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,210
weaker than you.

205
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,690
Even the snake I kept

206
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,330
was 100 times stronger.

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,810
without tiring so much.

211
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,780
At the Soulbud stage,

212
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,420
some flights of stairs are nothing to me.

213
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,490
But I know

214
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,210
that even if you can climb them, you don't like doing it.

You've always liked delicate things.

221
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,330
I put up

222
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,140
these lanterns after moving the tower here.

223
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,660
Do you like them?

224
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,380
In the Demon Realm, everything is practical.

225
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,420
It's rare to see something so beautiful.

226
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,970
If you like them,

227
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,940
I'll light them for you every day.

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,210
This is so beautiful,

236
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,330
like a sky full of stars.

237
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,660
You like watching the stars?

238
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,570
This is breathtaking.

239
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,610
It's been so long since I last saw a meteor shower.

240
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,610
This tower is perfect for stargazing.

241
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,850
It once stood on Three Saints Mountain.

242
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,780
I moved it here.

243
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,330
You must really like it.

244
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,660
I hate it.

245
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,020
It imprisoned me for 500 years.

246
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,010
Five hundred years?

247
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,160
Then why did you bring it here?

248
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,900
Because we once lived here.

249
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,660
It carries your aura.

250
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,380
I nearly forgot. I'm only a substitute.

251
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,010
None of this is really for me.

252
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,530
Is something missing here?

253
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,970
I'll kill you!

254
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,900
So what if your cultivation partner died?

255
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,970
Yes, my power caused her death,

256
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,580
but I didn't kill her!

257
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,180
You were the fool who schemed

258
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,050
against others

259
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,860
and ended up burning her to death by accident!

260
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,580
You keep blaming me.

261
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,340
Even if you feel nothing, I suffer!

262
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,970
You huge jerk! You scum!

263
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,820
Why does this flame curse

264
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,730
just like me?

265
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,210
Shut up.

266
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,620
You brought her back?

267
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,730
I once had you water it

268
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,450
so it would produce Bloodseal Blooms,

269
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,690
and you taught it to talk this way.

270
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,490
You vile, wicked woman!

271
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,690
How could you still water me after learning the truth?

272
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,580
You're just

273
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,730
a petty little evil flame.

274
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,690
Of course I'd choose

275
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,730
to obey the far more terrifying Grandmaster.

276
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,580
So this is the famed Bloodseal Bloom.

277
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,730
I taught it?

278
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,210
These loungers are exactly my style.

279
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,140
You really know how to enjoy yourself.

280
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,730
You taught me this.

281
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,660
So the body's original owner used facial masks too?

282
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,210
I haven't had time

283
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,010
to put on a mask and relax like this in years.

284
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,690
What's the point of it?

285
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,530
It keeps the skin moisturized.

286
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,820
When you were gone,

287
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,380
I once came here alone.

288
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,340
And somehow,

289
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,580
the past ten-odd years felt

290
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,140
even longer than the 500 years

291
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,050
in the Three Saints Mountain.

292
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,530
Remember:

293
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,580
he isn't doing any of this for you.

294
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,900
We once shared

295
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,380
countless memories here.

296
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,660
They are real,

297
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,340
unchanging,

298
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,210
and will never fade.

299
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,450
The truth is, I am not the Liao Tingyan you speak of.

300
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,730
We went through life and death together.

301
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,530
How could I mistake you?

302
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,770
But none of that matters.

303
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,050
You can treat today

304
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,050
as our first encounter.

305
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,690
From now on,

306
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,900
I will create new memories for us,

307
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,420
memories that belong

308
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,620
only to the present.

309
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,690
Will you allow it?

310
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,250
Then this

311
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,340
first meeting of ours, filled with lanterns and stars,

312
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,250
is quite romantic.

313
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,860
Other wounds, no matter how grave,

314
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,100
always heal under my treatment.

315
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,100
Why is it so hard with yours?

316
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,580
The more you gain,

317
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,010

My lord,

338
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,380
one of our men sent word that he saw him,

339
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,290
but by the time we got here,

340
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,900
all we found was this empty carriage.

341
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,580
He really was here.

342
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,820
He's over there.

343
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,620
After him!

344
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,490
Yes.

345
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,380
Let's go!

346
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,660
Qianlv...

347
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,970
- Well? - They're coming.

348
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,860
What do we do?

349
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,940
Already?

350
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,210
Run.

351
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,770
Qianlv!

352
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,940
Your legs...

353
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,250
Run, now!

354
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,530
Shi Qianlv,

355
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,730
you cannot escape.

356
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,250
They say you were crippled.

357
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,900
But now it seems you lied to Tingyan.

358
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,290
Enough talk!

359
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,620
Qianlv, go!

360
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,940
Keep chasing him.

361
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,940
I'll bring this one back to the Grandmaster.

362
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,580
Understood.

363
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,820
I actually slept all the way till morning again.

364
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,210
If you like them,

365
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,900
I'll light them for you every day.

366
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,340
Why is my face so hot?

367
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,900
Have I really fallen for Sima Jiao?

368
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,010
Yan, may I come in?

369
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,140
Come in.

370
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,770
Thank you.

371
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,690
I saw everything.

372
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,210
Sima Jiao really was laughable,

373
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,250
thinking he could win you over with tricks like that.

374
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,490
He's really underestimated you.

375
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,380
In fact,

376
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,770
he is very kind to me.

377
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,290
He treats you well

378
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,690
because of the woman he once loved.

379
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,940
It has nothing to do with you.

380
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,380
You said so yourself. Remember?

381
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,050
Those lanterns

382
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,970
and that tower

383
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,140
have nothing to do with you.

384
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,940
Don't get confused.

385
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,380
Enough. I know.

386
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,940
I feel like I'm the other woman right now.

387
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,820
His feelings aren't really for me.

388
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,250
Yan,

389
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,140
in fact, we...

390
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,100
I want to take you to see someone.

391
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,900
Aunt!

392
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,010
Don't call me that!

393
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,210
Our clan has no traitor like you!

394
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,180
How dare you speak such nonsense in front of me?

395
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,050
Please, calm down.

396
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,340
Free her first, will you?

397
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,620
I will let you see for yourself

398
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,940
how the Shi clan deceived you.

399
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,380
You wicked girl.

400
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,580
You killed your own brother.

401
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,860
And now, are you going to watch me

402
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,770
die for you too?

403
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,340
You should kill him now!

404
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,530
I'll cooperate.

405
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,250
But promise me this:

406
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,140
no matter what happens, don't harm her.

407
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,380
Very well.

408
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,180
I promise.

409
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,490
Sima Jiao,

410
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,650
you vile man!

411
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,520
Let me go! Let my father go!

412
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,970
Sima Jiao!

413
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,820
How could this be?

414
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,450
Yan.

415
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,210
Zhenxu.

416
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,290
Come on.

417
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,140
Let's go. Come with me.

418
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,770
But Father...

419
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,340
Don't worry about him.

420
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,490
I'll take care of it. Go now.

421
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,140
Leave this to me. Go!

422
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,290
I...

423
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,490
Zhenxu!

424
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,100
Just leave me.

425
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,530
Go!

426
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,820
Remember: kill Sima Jiao

427
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,050
to avenge our clan.

428
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,580
Zhenxu!

429
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,450
Tingyan...

430
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,290
She's using

431
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,180
Father's energy to heal my wounds?

432
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,530
He would even shorten his own life for me...

433
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,730
Someone tampered with her memories.

434
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,050
But weren't you the one

435
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,860
who showed me all that?

436
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,730
Aunt!

437
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,900
You promised not to hurt her.

438
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,970
When I performed Soul Search,

439
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,490
I shielded her soul.

440
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,290
I didn't hurt her.

441
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,050
My mind is a mess.

442
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,140
Give me time to think.

443
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,010
Tingyan...

444
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,290
I am not your Liao Tingyan!

445
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,580
And I don't want to be her!

446
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,580
You only need to be yourself.

447
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,690
You don't even know who I really am.

448
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,770
I do.

449
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,580
You like vacations.

450
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,380
You like touching fish.

451
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,820
And you hate killing most of all.

452
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,820
You're courting death!

453
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,970
Tingyan!

454
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,450
Tingyan!

455
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,340
Qiandu.

456
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,340
Please forgive me.

457
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,570
I never thought it would come to this,

458
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,450
using your life to buy myself

459
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,650
one last chance.

460
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,700
Qianlv,

461
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,530
we are already at the end of the road.

462
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,490
I am willing to give my life to win a chance for the Shi clan's revenge.

463
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,010
Absolutely not.

464
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,610
If you appear before Sima Jiao,

465
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,610
you will surely die.

466
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,380
Besides,

467
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,530
we still have

468
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,050
Liao Tingyan as a piece on the board.

469
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,050
If Liao Tingyan ever meant to strike,

470
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,300
would she have waited until now?

471
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,170
If I am captured and brought before Sima Jiao,

472
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,900
he will certainly use Soul Search on me

473
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,970
to prove himself to her.

474
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,570
You can implant the memories we want her to see

475
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,450
into my Soul Manor.

476
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,650
Once she has seen them,

477
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,170
I will end my own life,

478
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,900
and her hatred for Sima Jiao will be completely awakened.

479
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,700
But...

480
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,420
Qianlv, we have no time left.

481
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,130
They are closing in.

482
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,740
Let me bid you farewell here.

483
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,220
When the Shi clan's vengeance is fulfilled,

484
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,410
please let the winds carry word of it to me.

485
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,650
Sima Jiao,

486
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,970
you will die at the hands of the one you love most.

487
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,300
Grandmaster,

488
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,820
Senior Sister Tingyan is fine.

489
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,650
But she seems to have been forcibly subjected to repeated marrow cleansing.

490
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,820
Her Soul Manor has been badly damaged,

491
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,740
which is why she fainted when her emotions

492
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,450
became unstable.

493
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,900
As her cultivation partner,

494
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,090
you may try to enter her Soul Manor

495
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,490
and repair it yourself.

496
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,610
She has not accepted me yet.

497
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,970
Forcing my way into her Soul Manor would only hurt her.

498
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,970
Use my blood to heal her.

499
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,860
Grandmaster,

500
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,530
your wounds are already

501
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,220
harder to heal than before.

502
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,050
If you draw your blood directly...

503
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,170
With her spirit veins blocked,

504
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,050
using raw blood

505
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,530
might cause backlash.

506
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,700
It must be refined into a pill.

507
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,450
I've heard there are skilled alchemists in Winter City.

508
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,970
Perhaps I can seek their aid.

509
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,220
I will summon every alchemist in the city.

510
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,380
The pill must be made,

511
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,820
but see to it that it is not bitter.

512
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,090
Understood.

513
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,380
Nianjiu,

514
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,610
have you arranged the search for Shi Qianlv?

515
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,700
All preparations are complete.

516
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,860
We can depart at any time.

517
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,170
Then go now.

518
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,940
Yes.

519
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,490
By the way, Grandmaster,

520
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,900
while searching for him,

521
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,490
we could also seize the southwest of the Demon Realm.

522
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,450
The three cities there

523
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,220
have no intention of surrendering.

524
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,090
Don't waste lives needlessly.

525
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,530
Grandmaster,

526
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,820
you care about other people's lives now.

527
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,940
Grandmaster,

528
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,170
before I go, I have one more request.

529
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,340
When Hongluo is reborn,

530
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,340
I will send word to you.

531
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,700
Thank you, Grandmaster.

532
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,860
Where am I?

533
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,610
Could this be the legendary Soul Manor?

534
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,650
But my body's original owner is dead.

535
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,010
There shouldn't be a Soul Manor at all.

536
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,740
No...

537
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,610
This seems to be my Soul Manor.

538
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,260
Why does this flower

539
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,530
look so much like Sima Jiao's Bloodseal Bloom?

540
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,170
Liao Tingyan!

541
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,570
Zhenxu?

542
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,610
I'm out.

543
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,570
Tingyan!

544
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,490
Tingyan!

545
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,130
I'm back!

546
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:14,940
Hongluo!

547
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,820
Why are you a child?

548
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,220
I've grown quickly.

549
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,530
Truth is, I've only been alive three or four days.

550
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,740
If not for all the spirit medicines

551
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,490
poured on me since the Soul Transfer,

552
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,570
I'd still be a newborn now.

553
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,260
Why did you just now call me Tingyan,

554
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,610
like Sima Jiao does?

555
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,490
Did I?

556
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,170
It must have been instinct.

557
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,170
Since my rebirth,

558
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,900
strange visions keep surfacing in my mind.

559
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,010
I see you, me,

560
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,420
even Sima Jiao, and that City Lord, the Black Serpent.

561
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,220
But I have no memory

562
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,530
of living through any of them.

563
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,380
Anyway, I heard

564
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,150
it was you who asked Sima Jiao to perform the Soul Transfer for me.

565
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,070
Why would you do that?

566
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,940
Aren't you two supposed to be enemies?

567
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,110
That's a long story.

568
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,380
So,

569
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,570
you and your enemy, Sima Jiao,

570
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,300
once fell in love, and now you've reunited.

571
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,970
He says your father deceived you,

572
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,820
but your father says Sima Jiao deceived you.

573
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,450
Then, in a conflict,

574
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,530
Sima Jiao killed your aunt.

575
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,700
But when I accidentally entered my Soul Manor,

576
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,570
I felt something was off.

577
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,170
You actually entered your Soul Manor?

578
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,100
They say fragments of past memories appear there.

579
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,530
What did you see?

580
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,780
I saw that the one who killed my brother wasn't Sima Jiao.

581
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,530
It was me.

582
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,780
What?

583
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,300
Why would

584
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,300
such a memory appear in your Soul Manor?

585
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,740
Could it really be, as Sima Jiao said,

586
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,130
that you are Liao Tingyan

587
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,530
but have only lost that part of your memory?

588
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,260
That is exactly what baffles me.

589
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,380
If what I saw in my Soul Manor was true,

590
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,170
then my aunt's memories were false.

591
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,420
Besides, if Sima Jiao had something to hide,

592
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,450
he wouldn't have insisted on taking me to search for my aunt's soul.

593
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,700
So you suspect your father has been lying to you all along?
