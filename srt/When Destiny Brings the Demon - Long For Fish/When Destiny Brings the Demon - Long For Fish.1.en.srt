You need only sit in meditation, activate your heavenly crown,

188
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,730
and wait quietly.

189
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,730
Understood.

190
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,820
[Yuan Che, Ri Gui, Yin Liunian, Di Zhiyuan]

191
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,300
[Tian Wuya, Yang Chi, Xing Hecan, Yue Langning]

192
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,810
How do I activate my heavenly crown?

193
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,210
Do I just sit here?

194
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,660
[Mu Nisheng, disciple of Heaven Palace]

195
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,580
[An Xue, disciple of Yin Palace]

196
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,340
[Ye Ruling, disciple of Yin Palace]

197
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,500
[Yue Chuhui, Young Mistress of Moon Palace]

198
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,180
Wasn't I just here to make up the numbers?

199
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,690
Who bought me a debut spot?

200
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,420
There must be a mistake. If even I am not chosen,

201
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,850
how is that three-spiritual-root loser qualified?

202
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,380
I, the loser, would like to know that, too!

203
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,210
Mother...

204
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,610
Master!

205
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,090
Tingyan,

206
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,300
I heard you were chosen.

207
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,090
I am truly pleased

208
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,850
and honored as your master.

209
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,850
- Since Serene Vale's founding... - Stop.

210
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,260
Didn't you say

211
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,730
I was only there to make up the numbers?

212
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,100
How did I end up chosen?

213
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,810
Can you report this to the higher-ups?

214
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,620
I don't want to go.

215
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,000
Plenty would kill for this job offer.

216
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,380
What do you mean by "kill"?

217
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,380
In short, I am happy to give it

218
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,180
to someone else.

219
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,210
But Serene Vale is only a minor branch

220
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,810
within the Four Seasons Palace.

221
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,850
Being selected is such a great honor.

222
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,900
How could we refuse?

223
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,780
Besides,

224
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,380
this decision was made jointly by Sect Master Shi

225
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,730
and the eight palace heads.

226
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,540
It cannot be changed.

227
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,090
Even in the cultivation world,

228
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,730
people are forced to compete?

229
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,610
I just want to be a pretty good-for-nothing.

230
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,330
Besides, I know nothing about this place.

231
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,780
What if I offend the Grandmaster?

232
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,730
If he is displeased, I can't handle the consequences.

233
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,780
Don't worry.

234
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,300
Though I have never met

235
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,490
the Lord of Mercy,

236
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,020
his title suggests

237
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,940
leniency and kindness.

238
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,060
If you do not wish to serve him,

239
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,060
he likely will give you a hard time.

240
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,940
The Three Saints Mountain is rich in spiritual energy.

241
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,690
Going there will surely improve your cultivation.

242
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,060
A promotion and a raise

243
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,900
mean nothing to me.

244
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,540
I just want good food, good drink,

245
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,570
and to get by quietly.

246
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,210
Congratulations, Junior Sister!

247
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,090
- Congratulations! - Congratulations, Sister Liao!

248
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,730
- Congratulations. - You bring great honor to our branch.

249
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,060
[Bai Zhu, disciple of Serene Vale]
This is our gift to you.

250
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,510
Yes.

251
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,690
Why does it sound

252
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,570
like everyone's counting on me?

253
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,450
Now I'm really stressed.

254
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,540
Don't be.

255
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,780
Enough. Back up.

256
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,970
Stop giving her more pressure.

257
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,420
Tingyan, you being selected

258
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,450
has already brought honor to Serene Vale.

259
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,900
Given

260
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,970
your low cultivation level

261
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,730
and your reluctance to serve the Grandmaster,

262
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,140
he will probably

263
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,690
send you back before long.

264
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,690
So there is no KPI?

265
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,140
What?

266
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,810
All right, then.

267
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,180
Well, I cannot return to reality anyway.

268
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,330
A temporary break from the daily grind

269
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,570
might not be so bad.

270
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,900
So this is the Three Saints Mountain.

271
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,810
Why do I not see anything?

272
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,940
How could you, a mere three-spiritual-root

273
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,490
grasp the sanctity

274
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,300
of the mountain?

275
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,900
Three saints once ascended here.

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,450
Since the Lord of Mercy entered seclusion,

277
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,330
it has been closed for 500 years,

278
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,730
with no one entering.

279
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,180
Sounds like a hidden megadungeon in a game.

280
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,850
What's going on?

281
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,300
Grandmaster, please quell your anger.

282
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,210
Please quell your anger, Grandmaster.

283
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,970
Please quell your anger, Grandmaster.

284
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,970
When I come out, you will all die.

285
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,780
Wait.

286
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,490
Are we sure this is

287
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,970
a righteous grandmaster,

288
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,940
not one from the Demon Realm?

289
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,540
This Lord of Mercy

290
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,210
doesn't sound merciful at all.

291
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,780
Five hundred years have passed,

292
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,540
yet the Grandmaster has grown even more brutal.

293
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,180
What should we do?

294
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,060
If we cannot calm the Grandmaster,

295
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,660
the Gengchen Celestial Palace,

296
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,450
a great sect for hundreds of thousands of years,

297
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,900
may end

298
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,970
in our generation.

299
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,610
Grandmaster, I, Shi Qianlv,

300
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,140
have brought 100 disciples today

301
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,340
to serve you in the mountain.

302
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,820
Enter.

303
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,180
Nisheng,

304
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,290
you are the most outstanding of my disciples.

305
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,140
The Heaven Palace is counting on you.

306
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,820
Understood, Master.

307
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,140
So in the cultivation world, when the boss gets angry,

308
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,580
the employees start bleeding?

309
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,580
I should probably not go.

310
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,010
Let's go.

311
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,580
I've lost something.

312
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,010
Where did it go?

313
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,490
What are you looking for? I will help you look.

314
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,210
You're too kind. I can find it myself.

315
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,970
Oh, my stomach... It hurts so much.

316
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,580
I'm going to faint.

317
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,290
Ow... My stomach...

318
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,700
Get up there first.

319
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,690
It hurts.

320
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,450
It really hurts.

321
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,820
All right.

322
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,050
I'm fine now. I can walk on my own.

323
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,180
This Grandmaster is living in such a vile place.

324
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,100
Is he practicing some kind of demonic art?

325
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,140
Aunt-Master, this place is frightening.

326
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,770
[Qian Mo, disciple of Heaven Palace]
Should we really keep going?

327
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,970
Before we entered, Master Tian told me

328
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,380
there was a barrier in the mountain.

329
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,010
If you leave rashly,

330
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,050
you will anger the Grandmaster

331
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,770
and be swallowed by the barrier.

332
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,900
If you're tired of living, go ahead and run.

333
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,450
A snake!

334
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,740
How terrifying!

335
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,450
Please wait.

336
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,180
Senior,

337
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,620
we disciples are here to greet the Grandmaster.

338
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,530
We are new here. Please guide us.

339
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,820
Come on.

340
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,530
They're actually following it? No way I'm doing this job.

341
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,940
How bold.

342
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,820
Those people are too brave.

343
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,010
They couldn't leave, so they followed a snake.

344
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,580
Good thing this world has no time clock.

345
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,250
No one will notice I've skipped out.

346
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,940
What the...?

347
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,180
Demonic energy? She is from the Demon Realm.

348
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,660
Who's there? I can see you.

349
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,970
Clueless fool.

350
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,580
This is too creepy. I am going back.

351
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,940
Let's go.

352
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,100
In horror movies,

353
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,940
the first to die is always the one alone.

354
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,340
I should stay with the group.

355
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,970
The tower is so high.

356
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,450
But there's not even an elevator?

357
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,860
Blood!

358
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,340
What a bunch of fools.

359
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,940
Greetings, Grandmaster.

360
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,210
Greetings, Grandmaster.

361
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,010
The Grandmaster's feet

362
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,860
are incredibly well-cared-for.

363
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,290
So smooth and soft.

364
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,620
I wonder if his face is the same.

365
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,300
[Sima Jiao]

366
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,290
This centuries-old Grandmaster

367
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,900
is actually a pretty boy?

368
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,180
You.

369
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,940
Why have you come here?

370
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,580
[Yu Rongrong, disciple of Moon Palace]
I wish to serve you, Grandmaster.

371
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,100
Liar.

372
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,450
How can someone so fair-skinned

373
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,140
have such a bad temper?

374
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,660
He's like a landmine ready to explode.

375
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,420
Do not come near me.

376
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,290

377
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,490
I am Wan Ling. I worship you, Grandmaster,

378
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,860
and wish to serve you.

379
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,940
[Wan Ling, disciple of Yin Palace]

380
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,620
That wasn't Junior Sister Wan Ling. Who was she?

381
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,940
How dare she enter disguised as Wan Ling?

382
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,250
What did she want?

383
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,900
He seems to be looking at me.

384
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,100
Please, Grandmaster, just ignore me.

385
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,380
Here is someone even bolder.

386
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,010
How am I bold?

387
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,900
I have done nothing, Grandmaster.

388
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,210
Look at me.

389
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,620
Open your eyes and look at me.

390
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,240
You're still trying to play tricks?

391
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,050
I've done nothing, Grandmaster.

392
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,940
The Spirit Fire...

393
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,180
All of you, get out.

394
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,340
Out!

395
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,420
The Grandmaster seems to have lost his mind.

396
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,380
In fact, he's pure madness!

397
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,340
I suspect he let us in

398
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,010
just to stock up on fresh meat

399
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,470
for his pet snake.

400
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,430
Nonsense.

401
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,420
The audience is over for today.

402
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,050
We should find a place to rest

403
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,290
and wait for his orders.

404
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,900
Let's go.

407
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,940
like everyone has to obey her.

408
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,480
Well, I will not.

409
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,530
[Yun Xiyue and Hua Wanqing, disciples of Star Palace]

410
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,430
Let's go this way.

411
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,180
Looks like these palace schemers

412
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,250
aren't impressed with me.

413
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,770
Good. The less I stand out, the better.

414
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,530
I just want to make it out alive.

415
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,940
We've walked so long.

416
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,490
I think my feet are blistering.

417
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,100
Sima Jiao actually spared her in the hall.

418
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,660
What is so special about her?

419
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,530
I hope the Grandmaster

420
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,770
does not hold regular meetings

421
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,340
and will not see me again.

422
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,970
My feet hurt.

423
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,580
Let me help.

424
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,900
They do not hurt now.

425
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,250
Thank you.

426
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,420
I'm Liao Tingyan. What's your name?

429
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,010
Why are you alone, too?

430
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,180
Are you, like me,

431
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,490
from the "Doing Minimum Realm"?

432
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,380
"Doing Minimum Realm"?

433
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,420
Is she referring to the Demon Realm?

434
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,530
Where is the "Doing Minimum Realm"?

435
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,940
I just mean I do not want to serve the Grandmaster.

436
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,450
I am a disciple of the Yin Palace.

437
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,900
My palace master sent me here.

438
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,380
Why do you not want to serve the Grandmaster?

439
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,690
The entire Gengchen Celestial Palace

440
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,580
is sustained by his spiritual energy.

441
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,580
If you can gain his favor,

442
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,970
your cultivation will improve greatly.

443
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,660
In a short time, you could

444
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,530
achieve what would take a millennium of bitter training.

445
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,420
I have no such ambition.

446
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,340
I just want good food, good sleep,

447
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,860
and to stay alive.

448
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,250
Then what is your plan?

449
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,380
I plan to find a sunny spot

450
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,250
where I can nap in the sun at midday

451
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,900
and stay there.

467
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,180
Good. Once she kills Sima Jiao,

468
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,770
the Immortal-Demon Barrier will vanish,

will no longer be trapped in this desolate place.

471
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,770
When that time comes, you had better keep your promise.

472

and was already one with the Spirit Fire.

488

Thus, the duty of sustaining the Spirit Fire with flesh and blood
