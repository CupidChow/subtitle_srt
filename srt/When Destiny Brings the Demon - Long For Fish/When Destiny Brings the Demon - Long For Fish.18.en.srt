[Episode 18]
[No Quest is Harder Than Love]

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,500
Sect Master Shi,

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,420
all the damaged sites on the spiritual peak

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,780
show traces of Sima Jiao's spiritual power and the Spirit Fire.

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,530
It seems his target

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,340
is still you.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,700
I never thought

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,340
Sima Jiao would be so arrogant,

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,250
even with grave wounds.

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,900
If this continues,

31
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,810
I'm afraid the other spiritual peaks

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,020
would wind up like Baifeng Mountain.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,780
Come.

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,810
At your service, Sect Master Shi.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,340
Summon a dozen elite disciples

36
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,410
to strengthen the defenses on Wufeng Mountain.

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,570
Don't allow anyone

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,300
to set foot there again.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,300
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

40
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,780
Master Yuan,

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,220
Wufeng Mountain holds something

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,370
that's of great importance to the Shi family.

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,900
Go with them

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,300
and guard it well.

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,970
Report back at once if anything happens.

46
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,410
Yes.

47
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,740
Father, the Spirit Fire isn't on Wufeng Mountain.

48
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,890
Is this a trap to catch them?

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,130
Yuan Che clearly has something up his sleeve.

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,020
We'll play along.

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,340
We shall use Yuan Che as bait

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,970
to draw Sima Jiao to Wufeng Mountain.

53
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,130
I'll lead some disciples to set an ambush there.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,940
All right.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,340
By the way, Father,

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,300
the Spirit Fire is hidden on Taiwei Mountain.

57
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,650
It must also be guarded.

58
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,130
I'll take my men to protect it from behind.

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,810
You ought to conceal yourselves well

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,620
and hold the defense of Taiwei Mountain.

61
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,570
Once we capture Sima Jiao

62
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,500
and obtain his blood,

63
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,300
we can then find a chance

64
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,850
to merge with the new Spirit Fire.

65
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,410
Sect Master Shi, Madam Ye is here.

66
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,370
Let her in.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,300
Yes.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,220
Go prepare first.

69
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,180
Yes.

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,940
Madam Ye.

71
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,810
You'll follow me to Wufeng Mountain tomorrow.

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,690
That's a perfect chance for you

73
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,340
to take your clan back to the Demon Realm.

74
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,900
This time, you'd better show your utmost sincerity.

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,900
Is Sima Jiao at Wufeng Mountain?

76
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,060
He set his trap himself,

77
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,620
he will surely come.

78
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,100
Grandmaster, Yuan Che has sent word.

79
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,660
Please follow the spiritual power.

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,300
Fish in a barrel.

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,980
What fish? Shi Qianlv?

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,620
Don't worry about that.

83
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,980
I want to know.

84
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,100
Tell me, Nianjiu.

85
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,810
The Shi family's spiritual peaks are vast.

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,570
Even if Grandmaster sends out many puppets

87
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,420
to search,

88
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,010
it would consume much time.

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,200
So he has Yuan Che

90
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,420
damage the spiritual peaks

91
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,420
with Grandmaster's spiritual power

92
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,320
to provoke Shi Qianlv's suspicion.

93
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,720
That way, Shi Qianlv will dispatch men

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,130
to guard the place where the Spirit Fire is hidden.

95
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,060
If we follow them,

96
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,100
we can find the new Spirit Fire.

97
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,450
Stay here. I'll be back soon.

98
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,060
No, your wounds aren't healed.

99
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,890
I'll go with you.

100
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,210
I may not help much,

101
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,810
but being with you

102
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,980
is better than worrying here alone.

103
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,980
Just this once.

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,250
Let's go.

105
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,250
Master Yuan,

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,210
all Shi's disciples are in position.

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,100
Good.

108
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,860
Let's head to Wufeng Mountain.

109
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,860
Yes, Master Yuan.

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,180
Is everything ready?

111
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,250
Sect Master Shi,

112
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,210
300 elite disciples are gathered

113
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,890
to march with you.

114
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,300
Xu,

115
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,940
how's it on your side?

116
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,940
All is ready.

117
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,770
I can lead my men

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,180
to Taiwei Mountain at any time.

119
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,890
Excellent.

120
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,390
[Wufeng Mountain]

121
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,860
Sect Master Shi ordered us to guard this place.

122
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,940
You stay here.

123
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,330
I'll scout the surroundings first. Once it's clear,

124
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,660
I'll regroup with you.

125
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,450
Yes, Master Yuan.

126
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,450
Sect Master Shi.

127
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,540
Sect Master Shi,

128
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,130
don't forget your promise.

129
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,690
You may kill Sima Jiao,

130
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,770
but you mustn't hurt Liao Tingyan

131
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,060
or Hei Nianjiu.

132
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,740
Madam Ye, you're truly a loyal friend.

133
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,770
As long as you prove your sincerity,

134
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,100
I'll keep my word.

135
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,690
Sima Jiao will show himself soon.

136
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,250
Once he does, strike him down.

137
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,130
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

138
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,370
I wonder how things are going on Father's side.

139
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,860
Don't worry, Young Master.

140
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,660
Sect Master commands hundreds of disciples,

141
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,010
and most are beyond the Soulshift stage.

142
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,890
And with Sect Master leading the charge,

143
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,660
plus Sima Jiao's injury,

144
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,570
he won't get away so easily.

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,980
All we need to do is head to Taiwei Mountain and secure the Spirit Fire.

146
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,420
The Gengchen Celestial Palace will soon welcome its new master.

147
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,330
Let's go.

148
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,180
That old man

149
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,770
hid the Spirit Fire on Taiwei Mountain.

150
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,100
How did you know it wasn't on Wufeng Mountain,

151
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,740
and that they'd split their forces?

152
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,130
I had already planted puppets there.

153
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,420
I see.

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,370
You can sense the Fengshan bloodline

155
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,370
through puppets.

156
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,180
You knew long ago

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,330
the Spirit Fire wasn't on Wufeng Mountain.

158
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,540
And you also foresaw that Shi Qianlv

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,130
would send his men to guard the new Spirit Fire

160
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,090
out of caution.

161
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,970
So he divided his forces,

162
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,810
one to lure you in,

163
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,380
the other to guard the Spirit Fire.

164
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,330
So you played along,

165
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,210
had Yuan Che pretend to fall into his trap,

166
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,850
and at the same time, placed a tracking spell on Shi Zhenxu

167
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,060
to guide us,

168
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,850
saving us from searching blindly.

169
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,330
Brilliant.

170
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,490
It seems Yuan Che wasn't conspiring with Sima Jiao.

171
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,690
And Sima Jiao didn't fall for your plan either.

172
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,900
All is ready, Father.

173
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,540
I can lead my men

174
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,540
to Taiwei Mountain at any time.

175
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,260
No, it's a trap!

176
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,490
Zhenxu, Sima Jiao is after you.

177
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,610
Stop! Return at once!

178
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,450
Who's there?

179
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,020
Yuan Shang, you could've lived a few more days,

180
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,780
but you came seeking death.

181
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,060
You villain, I hold no grudge against you,

182
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,020
yet you try to harm me! Shameless!

183
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,450
You're nothing

184
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,210
but a coward who colludes with the Demon Race.

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,330
I'll kill you. You deserve to die.

186
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,690
You slaughter innocents for your own gain.

187
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,850
Compared to Sima Jiao,

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,570
you're the true heartless sinner!

189
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,810
Once I take the Gengchen Celestial Palace,

190
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,450
who is sinner and who is saint,

191
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,020
I will decide.

192
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,420
Old thing, die!

193
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,940
Shang.

194
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,450
Do you have a death wish, too, Yuan Che?

195
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,940
Shi Qianlv, you don't deserve to be called human!

196
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,140
Let's leave.

197
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,140
Father,

198
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,420
I'm useless and always a burden to you.

199
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,810
How could I ever blame you? You're my son.

200
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,140
I made grave mistakes out of greed,

201
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,940
and I've disappointed you.

202
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,380
But all I ever wanted was to be your pride,

203
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,210
not your burden.

204
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,970
I, Yuan Shang,

205
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,380
am no worthless trash raised by the Four Seasons Palace.

206
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,210
Shang!

207
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,180
Get up, all of you! Come with me to Taiwei Mountain.

208
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,450
It's Father's messenger crane.

209
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,180
Zhenxu, Si... is after...

210
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,970
Stop! Return... at once!

211
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,810
I can't hear it clearly.

212
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,570
Could something have happened to Father?

213
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,180
What is it, Young Master?

214
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,180
Something has happened to Father.

215
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,300
We must head to Wufeng Mountain now.

216
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:16,940
Let's go.

217
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,300
Yes, Young Master.

218
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,660
Sima Jiao?

219
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,570
Take me to the Spirit Fire.

220
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,690
Over my dead body.

221
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,780
In that case...

222
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,900
Sima Jiao, I'll see how long you can keep that smug face.

223
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,490
Once my father arrives,

224
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,970
you will die for sure.

225
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,450
The Gengchen Celestial Palace belongs to the Shi family.

226
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,900
My only regret

227
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,970
is that I can't kill you to avenge Xue.

228
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,300
I will not forgive you, even in death.

229
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,610
What nonsense are you spouting?

230
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,850
Anxue was killed by Shi Qianlv.

231
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,810
It had nothing to do with Grandmaster.

232
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,100
No. That's impossible.

233
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,280
This is all Sima Jiao's fault!

234
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,380
This is all your scheme!

235
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,140
Your wound just healed, but you're bleeding again.

236
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,610
It's fine.

237
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,850
You did well just now.

238
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,330
Since you're at it, carry on.

239
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,090
Kill him.

240
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,850
I don't think so.

241
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,180
I... I don't want to.

242
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,660
Sima Jiao, you're despicable.

243
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,250
You let this demon wench kill me?

244
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,140
You think you two can stay together forever?

245
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,690
You're courting death.

246
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,730
Your love bond will be severed by the way of heaven!

247
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,970
No!

248
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,380
No!

249
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,420
Why must you be mad with me?

250
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,430
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

251
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,820
No, I don't.

252
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,620
Shi Zhenxu was meant to kill us,

253
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,420
and he insulted you.

254
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,580
That's why I wanted you to kill him yourself.

255
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,100
I know you were born into a world

256
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,140
where it's kill or be killed.

257
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,970
I understand that.

258
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,530
But I will never kill unless there's no other way.

259
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,660
Is that so wrong?

260
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,690
Tingyan.

261
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,900
I don't want to talk to you now.

262
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,450
What do you want then?

263
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,050
I've never stopped you

264
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,940
or forced you to do anything.

265
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,420
You can't treat me this way.

266
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,730
For me,

267
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,340
there's only "want" or "don't want",

268
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,450
never "can't".

269
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,250
But for me,

270
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,420
killing is something I cannot do.

271
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,450
You may dislike killing,

272
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,900
but you must know how.

273
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,620
Otherwise, you'll only be killed.

274
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,140
Whatever the reason, I don't want to kill anyone.

275
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,620
And right now, I don't want to see you either.

276
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,730
Then, when will you want to see me?

277
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,770
Grandmaster,

278
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,820
I believe Shi Zhenxu was heading toward the Spirit Fire.

279
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,010
The puppets you transformed from Shi family's man earlier today

280
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,100
are already searching for the Spirit Fire

281
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,050
around the spiritual peak.

282
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,050
I'll go there to inspect.

283
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,730
Let me go with you, Grandmaster.

284
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,970
No, stay here and protect her.

285
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,730
Zhenxu.

286
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,050
It is all my fault

287
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,490
that you've suffered this fate.

288
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,960
[Shi Zhenxu]

289
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,820
Don't worry.

290
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,730
I'll kill Sima Jiao with my own hands

291
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,490
and avenge you.

292
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,770
Sect Master Shi, Taiwei Mountain is undisturbed.

293
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,490
Sima Jiao hasn't discovered the Spirit Fire yet.

294
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,730
Fortunately, we acted in time.

295
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,660
But...

296
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,210
My...

297
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,420
My son.

298
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,420
But Sima Jiao and his partner are strange.

299
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,690
They're impossible to track.

300
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,180
Didn't you already discover

301
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,770
that they once entered my treasury

302
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,770
and the Thunder Valley?

303
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,940
Go.

304
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,860
Follow this trail and send Ye Ruling to investigate.

305
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,940
She found Liao Tingyan last time.

306
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,820
She will surely find

307
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,710
their hideout again.

308
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,770
Go now.

309
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,860
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

310
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,100
Come back.

311
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,860
My patience is wearing thin.

312
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,770
Tell her to meet me in the secret chamber.

313
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,620
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

314
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,490
Canglan.

315
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,010
Canglan.

316
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,010
Are you all right?

317
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,720
Ruling.

318
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:29,970
Sect Master Shi,

319
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,580
why are you pressing us so hard?

320
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,100
Madam Ye,

321
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,290
you slew the back serpent last time.

322
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,820
Am I right?

323
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,730
But

324
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,050
why is he still alive?

325
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,580
You'd show mercy

326
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,660
to a mere beast,

327
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,530
let alone to Liao Tingyan.

328
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,860
Tell me, what should I do with you?

329
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,620
Sect Master Shi,

330
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,580
release my sister first.

331
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,210
Say what you want me to do.

332
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,290
In three days,

333
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,970
capture Liao Tingyan.

334
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,180
Otherwise,

335
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,340
if you fail by a single day,

336
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,580
I'll slaughter a hundred of your clan.

337
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,050
Canglan.

338
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,490
Canglan.

339
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,340
Sect Master Shi.

340
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,210
I think I've been too kind to you.

341
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,420
Canglan.

342
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,420
Canglan.

343
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,690
Three days.

344
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,730
You only have three days.

345
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,820
This is your last chance.

346
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,420
Canglan.

347
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,050
Canglan, don't be afraid.

348
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,380
I'm here.

349
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,620
I won't let anything happen to you.

350
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,660
Don't be afraid.

351
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,860
I'm not afraid of dying.

352
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,690
I only regret

353
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,380
that I can't see our people return home,

354
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,580
to see Mother's last wish fulfilled.

355
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,340
Don't say that.

356
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,940
I'm here with you.

357
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,210
I won't let you die.

358
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,970
Ruling,

359
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,620
my single life is nothing

360
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,210
compared to our whole clan.

361
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,550
Ruling,

362
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,860
don't let hatred blind you.

363
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,770
Remember

364
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,250
what you promised Mother and me.

365
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,250
You must bring our people home.

366
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,860
Canglan.

367
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,250
Canglan.

368
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,690
Canglan.

369
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,770
Canglan.

370
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,140
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,490
I'm so sorry.

372
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,530
It's my fault.

373
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,820
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,100
I'm sorry, Canglan.

375
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,450
Canglan.

376
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,860
How could this happen?

377
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,420
I know I killed someone. I was wrong.

378
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,450
Must you do this to me?

379
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,210
It was terrifying.

380
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,900
Don't make me keep remembering it.

381
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,580
No.

382
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,450
I must do something else

383
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,770
to distract myself.

384
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,050
I don't want to kill anyone.

385
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,970
And right now, I don't want to see you either.

386
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,820
Then, when will you want to see me again?

387
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,860
I can't sense her around here.

388
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,770
Did she leave?

389
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,210
Grandmaster.

390
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,620
Where did she go?

391
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,340
I don't know.

392
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,450
Tingyan told me not to follow.

393
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,660
She said

394
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,210
she was going to put the silence bugs caught in Thunder Valley

395
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,010
to great use.

396
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,970
It smells wonderful,

397
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,490
but I don't feel like eating at all.

398
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,140
Sima Jiao,

399
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,900
I once read in a travel anecdote

400
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,580
that the silence bugs can attract Soul Flying Fish,

401
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,010
so I secretly collected them,

402
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,180
hoping I could catch fish for you.

403
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,180
Let's try them together.

404
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,940
You mustn't do this again.

405
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,580
Do you still want to be angry with me

406
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,580
over something like this?

407
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,210
If you were

408
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,450
that lofty Grandmaster,

409
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,340
I wouldn't dare be angry at all.

410
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,690
But you're not.

411
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,450
You're the one dearest to me

412
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,580
in this world.

413
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,210
You're right.

414
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,420
Our peaceful days together

415
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,210
are precious.

416
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,690
I shouldn't have quarreled with you.

417
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,250
You say that

418
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,100
as if our good days are over.

419
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,380
Of course not.

420
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,340
I didn't sleep well this afternoon.

421
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,250
I'm tired.

422
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,580
You can rest.

423
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,690
Tingyan,

424
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,450
seeing you cry,

425
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,530
it was the first time in my life I felt regret.

426
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,970
From now on, I'll never force you to do

427
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,210
what's against your will.

428
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,940
There's nothing in this world

429
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,340
I fear.

430
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,050
But the thought of you

431
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,730
not eating

432
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,010
or sleeping well

433
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,010
really scares me.

434
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,250
Hold him down.

435
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,730
Don't be afraid.

436
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,180
It's a dream.

437
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,340
No.

438
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,690
This is the most frightening thing I've ever seen.

439
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,290
In my Soul Manor, I've witnessed

440
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,180
seas of corpses and blood

441
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,340
and the horrors of hell.

442
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,530
I never knew

443
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,290
that one could be so traumatized

444
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,490
just by killing an animal.

445
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,380
You can take my fear as a spectacle.

446
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,140
Of course not.

447
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,690
What is this?

448
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,940
You can sleep on it,

449
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,660
and you'll have sweet dreams.

450
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,940
That's incredible.

451
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,490
The pillow isn't as hard as it looks.

452
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,210
Quite comfortable.

453
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,700
I'll enter your Soul Manor to stay with you tonight.

454
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,530
What is that scent?

455
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,410
It smells like sweets.

Tingyan,

00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,860
let's divide the cake.

470
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,530
Sure.

471
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,380
Bring the plates.

472
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,490
Bring the plates.

Good morning, Jiao.

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,820
Did you have a nice dream?

484
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,780
Were you happy?

485
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,530
Very happy.

486
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,700
I dreamed my master and juniors

487
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,780
celebrated my birthday.

488
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,450
And you too.

489
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,570
We ate cake together.

490
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,700
It reminded me

491
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,860
of the days with my family.

492
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,220
So this jade pillow works wonders.

493
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,650
It's so useful.

494
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,120

and many artifacts and elixirs

498
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,490
are useless to me.

499
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,490

Once your heart is calmed by this pillow,

503
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,900
you can rest in my Soul Manor again.

504
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,450
But why carve

00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,170
a wild boar on it?

506
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,300
A wild boar?

507
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,220
That's a dream tapir.

508
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,420
It eats dreams.

509
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,220
This is the legendary dream tapir?

510
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,450
A mere dream tapir.

511
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,900
What's so legendary about it?

512
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,300
I've never seen one before.

513
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,420
I'll take you to see it

514
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,940
when I return.

515
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,050
Do you have important matters today?

516
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,820
Yes.

517
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,900
To pursue my career.

518
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,420
I'll leave Nianjiu here with you.

519
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,820
No matter what happens,

520
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,050
don't step into the Inner Court.

521
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,570
Alright.

522
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,610
Wasn't this Yingluo necklace broken

523
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,220
during the thunder tribulation?

524
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,900
How is it even more beautiful now?

525
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,610
I found the Thunderstone Core to reforge it.

526
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,820
Not even the lightning

527
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,780
can damage it now.

528
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,900
We just left Thunder Valley,

529
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,340
and you've secretly repaired it.

530
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,740
Impressive.

531
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,090
This artifact

532
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,260
can withstand all harm.

533
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,050
Even against

534
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,380
an expert like Shi Qianlv,

535
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,490
even if you lie still,

536
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,450
it would take half a day of his full strength

537
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,940
to break it.

538
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,860
And after it's broken?

539
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,490
Before that happens,

540
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,610
I'll find you.

541
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,610
You must promise me

542
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,380
not to tear open your wounds,

543
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,490
stumble, or fall.

544
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,570
I'll be worried.

545
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,450
No one can harm me.

546
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,820
Hark at him.

547
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,170
I mean, you're the best.

548
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,220
That's not what you really think.

549
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,260
My mind is calm now.

550
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,700
You can't read my thoughts.

551
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,530
I don't need to read them.

552
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,380
I can guess.

553
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,900
Wait for me.

554
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,220
I will.

555
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,090
You carry another trace

00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,420
of Sima blood.

557
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,570
It's from the one who feeds the Spirit Fire.

558
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,050
Take me to him.

559
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,650
The barrier is powerful.

560
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,900
Looks like

561
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,970
