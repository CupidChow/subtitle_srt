To have lived this long in defiance

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,530
was worth it.

46
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,020
Yan!

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,130

Yes.

54
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,100
I've waited so long for you.

55
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,100
Who are you?

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,250
We are the same person.

57
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,330
Are you my lost memories?

58
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,450
You could say that.

59
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,330
Together, you and I make up

60
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,330
the complete memory

61
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,980
of our time in this cultivation world.

62
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,300
Greetings, Masters and Madams.

63
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,060
A snake!

64
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,420
Watch out!

65
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,540
It's cheered you up, hasn't it?

66
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,890
Don't you like it?

68
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,660
is to live a carefree life, eating, drinking,

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,060
and enjoying myself.

70
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,250
Jiao!

71
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,500
Come!

72
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,210
I'm doing this

73
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,570
because I cherish you so much.

74
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,180
I don't want you to be harmed in the slightest.

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,370
Now, you are the one closest to me

76
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,660
in this world.

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,420
When I saw you cry,

78
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,180
I felt regret for the first time in my life.

79
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,060
From now on, you will not just be my boyfriend.

80
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,100
Sima Jiao,

81
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,690
this time,

82
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,370
I can't wait for you to come home.

83
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,300
I remember now.

84
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,860
I remember everything now.

85
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,740
How do we get out of here?

86
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,420
Sima Jiao is injured.

87
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,940
I need to save him.

88
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,860
Sima Jiao is injured?

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,060
Was it your doing?

90
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,620
The cold energy here

91
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,100
awakened my assassin instincts as the Frost Fish,

92
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,810
and I lost control.

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,810
I...

94
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,330
I stabbed him.

95
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,420
How could you hurt the one

96
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,770
I cherished the most?

97
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,130
Now,

98
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,500
what matters most is finding a way

99
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,180
to leave the Bone Pool and save him.

100
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,330
The Bone Pool is bottomless.

101
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,100
Before you woke, I tried to swim out,

102
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,980
but I failed.

103
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,250
Then together,

104
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,540
we will succeed.

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,810
My lord, I have slain Sima Jiao.

106
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,100
The blood of the Fengshan Clan is ready.

107
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,570
But the barrier at Yin-Yang Lake remains.

108
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,010
That means Sima Jiao isn't dead yet!

109
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,620
What?

110
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,130
You can't even handle Sima Jiao.

111
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,660
Had I been in command,

112
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,690
I would have rallied the Demonic Army

113
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,210
and personally led a march into the Gengchen Celestial Palace.

114
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,940
My lord,

115
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,300
don't waste time

116
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,260
arguing with him.

117
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,180
Feng Qi, do it!

118
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,330
Are you ready?

119
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,330
I will make every moment

120
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,660
of death's approach

121
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,090
so painfully real

122
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,780
that you will recall

123
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,660
each and every sin you ever committed.

124
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,540
Feng Qi, let me go!

125
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,210
Yan!

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,260
How dare you use me to harm him?

127
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,490
As expected of the assassin I raised with my own flesh and blood.

128
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,900
Shut up!

129
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,180
Feng Qi,

130
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,730
quicken the sacrifice!

131
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,300
You want to take what is mine?

132
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,420
I won't let you!

133
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,210
Liao Tingyan, remember this:

134
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,180
I was the one who gave you form.

135
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,540
From now on, you will fight for me, You Chi!

136
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,970
You fool! What are you doing?

137
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,660
Stop her!

138
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,690
No!

139
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,420
My lord!

140
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,570
What happened?

141
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,020
The Frost Fish

142
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,970
has merged with the Demon Lord's core!

143
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,810
What?

144
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,090
Doesn't that make her

145
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,380
our new ruler?

146
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,900
What are you talking about?

147
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,330
Ridiculous. I don't want to be your ruler.

148
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,940
How is the Grandmaster?

149
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,020
How is he?

150
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,940
His spiritual power is severely depleted,

151
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,330
and he has lost too much blood.

152
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,570
I fear

153
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,060
he cannot be saved.

154
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,380
How could that be?

155
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,020
The Grandmaster is gravely injured, and Yan is missing.

156
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,940
What are we supposed to do?

157
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,380
Bai Zhu, you take care of the Grandmaster.

158
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,420
We will think of a plan.

159
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,540
Yes.

160
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,090
I knew that woman couldn't be trusted.

161
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,020
I wondered why she could ease

162
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,450
Sima Jiao's pain from the Spirit Fire.

163
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,970
Turns out she didn't ease it. She just suppressed it.

164
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,970
Now that her extreme-cold nature has been fully awakened,

165
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,450
if she wants him dead, he'll die at any moment!

166
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,940
Tingyan would never harm the Grandmaster.

167
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,850
At the end of the day, she is from the Demon Race.

168
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,330
There's no way she truly cares for him!

169
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,940
You...!

170
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,810
And he, foolish as ever, used his own heart-protecting bone

171
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,140
to make her a protective artifact.

172
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,330
In the end, he left himself riddled with wounds

173
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,940
and barely able to control the Spirit Fire.

174
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,900
Could you not

175
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,140
say such pointless things

176
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,850
at a time like this?

177
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,540
Liao Tingyan is a Frost Fish assassin by nature,

178
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,450
while Sima Jiao is the Spirit Fire's host.

179
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,780
The two were born enemies,

180
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,060
yet they insisted on being together.

181
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,300
Wasn't that a losing battle they were fighting?

182
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,940
He is in terrible condition. If you don't

183
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,060
wake him soon,

184
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,210
he will burn himself alive!

185
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,060
With the Grandmaster unconscious,

186
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,810
what if...

187
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,060
what if the Demon Race attacks us now?

188
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,260
What should we do?

189
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,610
Perhaps... perhaps I can try something.

190
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,260
Nianjiu,

191
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,940
the Grandmaster once cast a protective spell on me

192
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,570
to conceal my aura as a Fengshan descendant.

193
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,090
Now that he is in danger,

194
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,060
I ask you to lift the spell

195
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,180
so I may replenish his blood through Blood Infusion.

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,450
I know it may have little effect,

197
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,180
but this is the only way I can help him.

198
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,260
Bi'an, I will perform the Blood Infusion carefully.

199
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,730
You won't be harmed. Don't worry.

200
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,810
It doesn't matter.

201
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,900
If it can save the Grandmaster

202
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,780
and protect peace between immortals and demons,

203
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,660
my death would be worth it.

204
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,690
But your life is precious too.

205
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,140
Bai Zhu is right.

206
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,900
Even if you gave all your blood to the Grandmaster,

207
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,260
we couldn't be sure it would work.

208
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,420
Besides,

209
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,490
if he knew,

210
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,330
he would never allow you to sacrifice yourself this way.

211
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,690
Are you all right?

212
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,450
His condition has somewhat stabilized.

213
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,780
But if he doesn't wake soon,

214
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,140
it will still be very dangerous.

215
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,180
Still, this much improvement means there is hope.

216
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,490
Bi'an, thank you.

217
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,730
This is what I should do.

218
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,260
Dear gods,

219
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,380
I pray to you

220
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,300
that the Grandmaster will wake safe and sound.

221
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,380
I smell Fengshan blood...

222
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,140
And please let Ms. Yan return safely soon.

223
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,380
So besides Sima Jiao,

224
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,850
another Fengshan descendant still lives.

225
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,810
Why are you following me?

226
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,610
Do you really want me to be your ruler?

227
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,970
You have absorbed the Demon Lord's core.

228
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,970
Only you can be our ruler now.

229
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,090
Besides, it was you who gravely injured the Grandmaster of the Celestial Palace.

230
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,490
That makes you our new ruler.

231
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,610
Greetings, Madam!

232
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,020
But the Grandmaster of the Celestial Palace is only injured, not dead.

233
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,020
I heard she and that Grandmaster

234
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,970
had a murky relationship.

235
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,490
What if this is just a trick to deceive us?

236
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,900
Madam, now that Sima Jiao is gravely injured,

237
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,380
why don't we help you kill him

238
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,180
and destroy the Spirit Fire?

239
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,090
If you can kill Sima Jiao,

240
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,690
I will acknowledge you as Demon Mistress.

241
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,060
I can't let them

242
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,850
go after Sima Jiao at a time like this.

243
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,020
If you all go, it will draw too much attention.

244
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,020
While he is gravely injured,

245
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,060
I will kill him alone.

246
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,300
Then everything will be solved.

247
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,690
What do you say?

248
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,380
Then we shall wait here for your triumphant return, Madam.

249
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,010
Sima Jiao!

250
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,660
This is impossible.

251
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,340
Did I really kill him?

252
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,820
Sima Jiao,

253
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,940
wake up.

254
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,010
Look at me.

255
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,690
Sima Jiao,

256
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,290
wake up and look at me.

257
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,690
Yan, he isn't dead.

258
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,210
Calm down.

259
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,290
Senior Sister Tingyan,

260
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,250
everything here is to help keep the Grandmaster's vitality steady.

261
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,140
We have been waiting for your return.

262
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,250
Tingyan, only you can save him now.

263
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,050
Sima Jiao!

264
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,940
Sima Jiao!

265
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,940
No!

266
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,900
It's been hours. Why hasn't anything happened?

267
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,450
Sister Tingyan may have fallen into the Grandmaster's dreamscape.

268
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,210
If she cannot find the way out,

269
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,770
she will be trapped there

270
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,730
until she fades away.

271
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,180
I'll go wake her.

272
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,770
No, don't!

273
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,180
If interrupted by an external force,

274
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,380
the Grandmaster's Soul Manor will close immediately,

275
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,660
and the two of them will never come out again.

276
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,580
Tingyan,

277
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,970
don't give up.

278
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,050
This is the night when the Sima clan was wiped out,

279
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,010
the beginning of Sima Jiao's lifelong nightmare.

280
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,940
If I save him here,

281
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,050
he should awaken

282
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,530
into another fate, right?

283
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,290
No!

284
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,900
You cannot take Jiao away.

285
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,820
Do you want to watch him die here?

286
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,690
As long as Jiao remains here, he still has a chance.

287
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,490
If you take him away,

288
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,820
he will vanish without a trace.

289
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,970
Then how can I save him?

290
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,340
The Spirit Fire.

291
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,010
The Spirit Fire?

292
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,900
Only the Fengshan Spirit Fire can save him.

293
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,530
It is both the curse of our clan

294
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,530
and the thing that can save our lives.

295
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,690
If so, why haven't you acted?

296
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,210
He's already...

297
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,690
The fire seed is about to die out,

298
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,250
but I can't take him back to Thunder Valley either.

299
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,620
Jiao...

300
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,050
Thunder Valley?

301
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,730
If I take him back there,

302
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,900
will the Spirit Fire be restored?

303
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,770
Grandmaster.

304
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,530
Tingyan,

305
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,770
how is he?

306
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,380
Where are you taking him?

307
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,820
Thunder Valley.

308
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,620
It will probably take thunderbolts to reignite the Spirit Fire.

309
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,940
But there is no tribulation to go through now.

310
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,660
If I want lightning,

311
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,250
I must defy the way of heaven myself.

312
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,180
Look at how chaotic the Immortal and Demon Realms have become!

313
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,210
Why haven't you intervened?

314
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,180
Sima Jiao struck down You Yan for you.

315
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,140
Why do you want his life in return?

316
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,530
You call this the way of heaven?

317
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,010
How are you worthy of people's worship?

318
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,420
I haven't even gotten to the point,

319
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,250
and you strike already?

320
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,210
Oh, I see. The Demon Lord's core is inside me.

321
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,940
You are furious that a demon

322
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,490
has entered

323
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,340
the holy Immortal Realm, aren't you?

324
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,490
Immortals and demons

325
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,770
are all living beings.

326
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,690
What difference is there?

327
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,450
So what if this is a holy place?

328
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,340
I am not leaving.

329
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,770
Strike me down with your 81 thunderbolts, I dare you!

330
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,380
If you don't, I will destroy this so-called heaven

331
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,970
that has no mercy!

332
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,340
I can't die yet.

333
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,050

As Demon Mistress,

364
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,420
you gave in to me quite easily.

365
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,690
Are you fully recovered now?

366
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,210
When I went into your Soul Manor earlier,

367
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,450
it was a wreck.

368
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,860
If you had been an ordinary man,

369
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,770
would the pain have killed you long ago?

370
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,940
But am I an ordinary man?

371
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,530
So you're all right now?

372
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,530
This is all my fault. I should never have gone to Grain Rain Vale.

373
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,420
I was too naive.

374
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,490
In a world like this,

375
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,620
how could there have been such a paradise?

376
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,490
How foolish I was.

377
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,140
And I nearly got you killed.

378
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,340
Once I clear away the filth from both the Immortal

379
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,180
and Demon Realms,

380
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,770
wherever you go will be like Grain Rain Vale.

381
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,940
You mean you want to unify both realms?

382
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,180
Did you ask the Demon Realm's ruler about that?

383
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,380
My cultivation partner is the Demon Mistress.

384
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,970
Do I really need to be worried?

385
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,490
I only stumbled into this position.

386
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,860
I have no real authority.

387
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,420
They let me be Demon Mistress

388
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,290
only because of the demon core inside me.

389
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,140
They obey on the surface,

390
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,340
but in truth, it all depends on how I behave.

391
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,940
The Demon Realm is a place where only the strong are respected.

392
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,010
You are the only one in this world

393
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,340
who can make me yield without a fight.

394
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,180
That makes you the strongest of all.

395
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,770
The people of the Demon Realm won't be so easily fooled.

396
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,050
I will sort everything out for you.

397
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,530
You just need to sit back and relax.

398
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,530
You are doing so much for me.

399
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,290
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

400
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,050
Whether in a civil war or a war against outsiders,

401
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,420
it is always the common people who suffer most.

402
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,490
Why don't we work toward uniting immortals and demons?

403
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,450
As for those who resist,

404
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,450
we can take our time dealing with them.

405
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,530
As you wish.

406
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,050
Master Yuan, what is going on?

407
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,210
It's the Grandmaster and the Grandmistress.

408
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,180
Sima Jiao is alive?

409
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,180
How did our ruler

410
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,770
become their Grandmistress?

411
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,970
I told you

412
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,250
she couldn't destroy the Spirit Fire.

413
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,450
Now she's even consorting with Sima Jiao.

414
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,290
Do you still want to accept her as Demon Mistress?

415
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,050
War is never a lasting solution.

416
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,290
The Grandmaster of the Celestial Palace and I have reached an agreement.

417
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,420
He will help us resolve

418
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,450
the Demon Realm's lack of spirit veins for cultivation.

419
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,420
Is that true?

420
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,620
That's wonderful!

421
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,010
For the Demon Realm,

422
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,250
this is an unexpected blessing!

423
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:53,940
Amazing!

424
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,940
There is one rule.

425
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,770
As long as you

426
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,940
no longer stir up conflict with the Immortal Realm,

427
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,010
you will be able to cultivate with spirit veins

428
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,050
just like those in the Celestial Palace.

429
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,340
There will be no more need for twisted practices

430
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,100
or spells that seize people's cores.

431
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,290
We won't have to eat people anymore!

432
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,490
If anyone dares to cause trouble...

433
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,380
We will follow your lead, Madam.

434
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,620
Then this is the day the Immortal-Demon War ends completely.

435
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,380
No more barriers will be raised.

436
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,290
People will move freely and coexist peacefully.

437
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,900
You must also set an example yourselves

438
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,340
to guide those outside the Celestial Palace.

439
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,140
Yes, Grandmaster!

440
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,900
Where has Bi'an gone?

441
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,820
Sima Jiao,

442
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,820
you are really hard to kill.

443
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,860
The aura of the Fengshan bloodline...

444
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,140
I've found her.

445
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,250
Bi'an, I've finally found you.

446
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,380
What are you doing here?

447
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,620
We've been looking for you.

448
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,970
You are not Bi'an.

449
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,010
How loyal you are.

450
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,970
Even on the brink of death, you still try to send word.

451
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,530
Bai Zhu is dead?

452
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,530
Yes.

453
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,970
After Bi'an went missing,

454
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,140
Bai Zhu and I

455
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,420
split up to search for her.

456
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,770
But just now,

457
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,820
Bai Zhu's life lamp went out.

458
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,210
His soul is completely gone.

459
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,940
It's my fault. I shouldn't have let him search alone.

460
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,580
Though the conflicts between immortals and demons have calmed recently,

461
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,010
the two realms are still in chaos.

462
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,250
Many demonic cultivators

463
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,940
are still trying to seize the cores of the Celestial Palace disciples.

464
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,660
Bi'an had her protective spell lifted.

465
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,340
Her blood aura

466
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,210
could easily be found by You Yan's lingering soul.

467
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,690
Judging by her sudden disappearance

468
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,970
and Bai Zhu's death,

469
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,820
I fear You Yan has already found Bi'an

470
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,690
and intends to use her body for rebirth.

471
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,940
So,

472
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,340
Bai Zhu's death was You Yan's doing?

473
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,700
I will do whatever it takes to find him

474
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,090
and avenge Bai Zhu and Bi'an!

475
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,170
Those traitors of the Demon Realm

476
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,530
must be hoping

477
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,860
for You Yan's return,

478
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,010
so they refuse to obey Tingyan.

479
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,090
Even with only a wisp of soul left, that filthy worm

480
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,260
still managed to cause such turmoil.

481
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,900
Mingli.

482
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,090
Mingli is You Yan's confidant.

483
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,050
If we want to find You Yan, Mingli is the key.

484
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,260
As for the other troublemakers, they are like weeds.

485
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,650
Rooting them out cannot be done in a day.

486
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,650
Go to the Celestial Palace

487
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,610
and find cultivators skilled in strategy and war,

488
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,740
preferably ones familiar with the Demon Realm.

489
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,610
Have Tingyan choose those she trusts,

490
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,530
and leave them in the Demon Realm to serve her.

491
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,530
Now that the Immortal and Demon Realms

492
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,420
are temporarily at peace,

493
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,860
we can let

494
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,050
those long-displaced disciples of the Celestial Palace return home.

495
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,820
Yes, Grandmaster.

496
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,220
My lord,

497
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,300
word has it the Frost Fish and Sima Jiao are in league.

498
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,260
They even want to unite the Immortal and Demon Realms.

499
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,010
The demonic cultivators may obey him out of fear

500
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,700
for Sima Jiao's strength.

501
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,260
Though this body of the Fengshan descendant

502
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,780
can repair my primordial spirit,

503
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,530
I am too gravely wounded

504
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,700
to fully seize

505
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,300
her body for myself just yet.

506
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,090
I must enter seclusion to heal.

507
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,420
When my primordial spirit is whole again,

508
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,650
I will reemerge.

509
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,260
But with You Chi dead,

510
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,570
you won't be able to appear in your true form.

511
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,740
When this body is spent,

512
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,530
you will revert to a disembodied soul again.

513
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,220
Don't be so short-sighted.

514
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,820
For millennia, I have descended into the world again and again.

515
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,860
My purpose has never been mere survival,

516
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,010
but to open the Nine Nether Purgatory

517
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,300
and release the sealed Demonic Army.

518
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,780
When that day comes,

519
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,650
the Demon Realm will enter a new golden age.

520
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,130
Your wisdom is unmatched.

521
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,650
As for Liao Tingyan, she is not of the You clan.

522
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,900
She cannot hold the position of Demon Mistress for long.

523
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,740
Here's a wisp of my demonic energy.

524
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,970
It can take root in human desire.

525
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,450
Use it

526
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,970
to further our cause while I am away.

527
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,300
Guard the Demon Realm well

528
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,380
and wait for my return.

529
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,940
Yes, my lord.

530
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,490
What do you want?

531
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,380
Are you here to capture me for Liao Tingyan?

532
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,220
My father once told me

533
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,740
the Demon Lord's core can only be absorbed by those from the You clan.

534
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,860
Yan is an outsider.

535
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,010
Why was she able to merge with it?

536
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,490
Why should I tell you?

537
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,220
You don't have to.

538
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,220
But in that case,

539
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,170
I will take you to Sima Jiao

540
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,700
and let him ask you.

541
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,420
Preceptor, you and the former Demon Lord once saved my clan.

542
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,900
I am not ungrateful.

543
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,700
But I will never let Yan come to harm.

544
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,650
Fine, I will tell you.

545
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,130
You are right.

546
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,860
Without outside help,

547
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,090
Liao Tingyan could never have merged with the demon core.

548
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,380
If you use the Chang clan's secret technique to aid the fusion,

549
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,050
you'll exhaust your cultivation.

550
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,650
Moreover, she is already in Sima Jiao's pocket,

551
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,170
which makes her a traitor to the Demon Realm.

552
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,700
I advise you

553
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,260
not to waste your strength on her,

554
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,260
or you will only end up benefiting Sima Jiao.

555
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,060
[Yan City]

556
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,940
Master!

557
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,380
Senior Brother.

558
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,490
Tingyan.

559
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,090
Are you preparing your dowry?

560
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,130
That's right.

561
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,260
Sima Jiao said he built me a city, Yan City,

562
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,700
so it would be easier for us to meet.

563
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,010
It spans from Mount Daiying,

564
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,450
with its autumn-colored slopes

565
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,860
and cold sands along the streams,

566
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,380
all the way to the Lone Peaks.

567
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,900
He gave me such a grand gift.

568
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,420
I should return the gesture.

569
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,570
After much thought, I decided the best gift would be a proposal.

570
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,780
Oh, my girl has truly grown up.

571
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,780
That Black Serpent probably won't stay put either.

572
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,050
What do you mean?

573
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,970
Didn't you appoint Mu Nisheng as a general?

574
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,940
Now Hei Nianjiu can't stop fawning over her.

575
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,450
Mu Nisheng has strategy and vision.

576
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,420
She's perfect for a general.

577
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,450
You are clever and quick-witted.

578
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,780
Why don't you be my preceptor?

579
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,780
That way, Nianjiu would be chasing after you every day.

580
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,740
I could give it a try.

581
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,740
But it's not because

582
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,860
I want him around me all day.

583
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,050
Really, it's not!

584
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,420
All right...

585
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,010
I'm here for Hongluo.

586
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,900
Nianjiu,

587
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,220
when you first took human form, I told you

588
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,170
that feelings took time to grow.

589
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,380
But I left something out.

590
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,170
Once those feelings are deep enough,

591
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,340
you must seize the moment,

592
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,940
or you'll lose your chance.

593
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,090
Good luck.

594
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,170
Hongluo.

595
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,260
What is it?

596
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,970
This is Qiling nectar

597
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,420
I brought back from Serene Vale.

598
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,490
They say it strengthens the lungs

599
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,860
and nourishes the Seven Senses.

600
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,300
Maybe

601
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,490
it will help you

602
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,700
remember some of your past.

603
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,490
I don't like sweets.

604
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,380
Hongluo,

605
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,820
I know you want to turn it down again,

606
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,260
but this carries my feelings for you.

607
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,130
Back then,

608
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,740
you gave me a name

609
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,450
and stirred something inside me.

610
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,260
Since then, I've always been drawn to you.

611
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,450
But I was newly human then.

612
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,220
I didn't realize

613
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,220
you were someone who kept

614
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,610
everything hidden deep inside.

615
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,010
I'm sorry.

616
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,300
I let you bear

617
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,420
all those burdens alone

618
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,300
and swallow so much bitterness.

619
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,490
This time,

620
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,300
I want you to have a sweet, happy life.

621
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,970
Hongluo...

622
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,130
It sounds

623
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,050
as though our past was full of twists and turns,

624
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,650
almost like a storyteller's tale.

625
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,130
I meant to take the nectar.

626
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,260
Well?

627
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,260
Do you like it?

628
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,340
It's all right.

629
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,450
That's it?

630
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,490
"All right"?

631
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,420
Is there anything special about this city?

632
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,650
You've seen

633
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,170
every object

634
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,420
and every scene here before.

635
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,650
This city is built from our memories

636
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,490
since the day we first met.

637
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,610
Now that you mention it, I do recall.

638
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,300
But compared to this city,

639
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:02,900
Lord of Mercy,

640
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,050
I have a matter that concerns both immortals and demons

641
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,700
to discuss with you.

642
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,530
Do you remember my suggestion

643
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,380
about an exchange program between the two realms?

644
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,860
What do you think?

645
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,010
Too troublesome.

646
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,700
Too likely to cause problems.

647
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,340
Then why don't we start with a celebration?

648
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,900
It would lift everyone's spirits.

649
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,900
What is there to celebrate?

650
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,170
How about a marriage between an immortal

651
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:38,970
and a demon?

652
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,220
Are you

653
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,900
proposing to me?
