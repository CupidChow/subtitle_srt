[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,420
[Episode 3]
[Don't bother guessing. Live your life.]

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,290
You came back from the dead?

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,060
You're still alive?

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,060
Miss...

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,860
I mean,

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,170
you didn't die after all.

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,900
Of course not.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,810
I never meant to offend Grandmaster.

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,210
He was just giving me

30
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,340
a lesson and a warning.

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,980
I will remember it well.

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,500
I will be more prudent.

33
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,330
How is Grandmaster today?

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,610
Him?

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,980
No way.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,010
I can't spread gossip

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,940
about the boss.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,820
Reporting to Aunt-Master,

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,540
Grandmaster is doing perfectly fine.

40
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,860
Serving Grandmaster is a privilege.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,700
Make the most of it.

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,890
So when he said he would kill me,

43
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,170
he was only trying to scare me.

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,330
Now that I think about it,

45
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,260
Grandmaster does not act like one at all.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,700
He acts like a schoolkid.

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,860
Maybe aside from being

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,420
a little slow in the head,

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,860
he isn't one to kill someone

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,860
over every little thing.

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,490
She can take the edge off

52
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,450
the burning pain my Spirit Fire causes.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,770
If she truly has no greed toward me,

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,890
she could be a very useful piece in the game.

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,820
Undo the barrier outside the tower.

56
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,940
Say it is to catch a Demon Realm spy.

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,570
Open the gate.

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,100
The rat will follow the gap

59
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,290
and slip inside.

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,290
At least I won't have to clock in for work.

61
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,730
I can sleep so well!

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,220
No water left.

63
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,130
This disciple seems to be favored by Grandmaster.

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,730
She comes and goes from the Central Tower.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,100
Yes. I wonder what is so special about her.

66
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,460
Maybe only those with low cultivation can get close to Grandmaster?

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,690
Who knows.

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,290
How are you still alive?

69
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,100
I am embarrassed.

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,610
I am the low-key type.

71
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,370
I haven't run into any danger yet.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,420
You escaped from the main hall.

73
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,780
You got lucky.

74
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,610
You had better not have

75
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,170
any vile thoughts toward Grandmaster.

76
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,220
Otherwise,

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,130
you will die eventually.

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,490
What?

79
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,050
Worried she will beat you to it

80
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,930
and win Grandmaster's favor?

81
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,900
Her? Really?

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,460
Some low-grade spiritual root

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,460
that came out of nowhere?

84
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,290
How is she worthy?

85
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,370
So what if it is low-grade?

86
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,050
Does cultivation and a noble background

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,170
make someone naturally superior?

88
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,540
Of course it does.

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,100
What is it, Ye Ruling?

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,810
Just because you were born low,

91
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,860
you feel connected with her?

92
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,130
A word of advice.

93
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,810
You should find another companion.

94
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,290
Her status

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,290
is even lower than your low-grade spiritual root.

96
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,450
Miss.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,130
Aunt-Master.

98
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,810
It is fine if you think I am useless.

99
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,810
But why resort to personal attacks?

100
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,300
You rely on your higher cultivation

101
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,860
to bully those weaker than you.

102
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,620
Is that not being petty?

103
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,890
Utter nonsense.

104
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,420
Birds of a feather, indeed.

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,540
They insulted you.

106
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,060
You never fought back.

107
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,860
Why are you willing to speak up for me today?

108
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,370
They look down on me for being behind.

109
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,370
I accept that.

110
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,980
But I can't stand it when they

111
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,610
use background as an excuse.

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,490
That is too much.

113
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,380
I may not fully understand

114
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,250
what you are saying,

115
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,420
but I can tell

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,460
you are not looking down on me.

117
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,900
You are so pretty

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,780
and capable.

119
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,460
I can only admire you.

120
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,930
Here is my thank-you gift.

121
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,610
It is very sweet. Try it.

122
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,340
Thank you.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,660
I really like it here more and more.

124
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,370
No clocking in for work,

125
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,810
and I met good colleagues.

126
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,460
Although there are also

127
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,490
those obsessed with office politics,

128
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,050
as long as I stay out of it,

129
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,220
I'll be safe.

130
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,020
Clock in?

131
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,810
Office politics?

132
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,490
What are those?

133
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,020
I don't quite understand.

134
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,170
Just think of them as

135
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,460
our Serene Vale slang.

136
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,540
I see.

137
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,170
Do you really want nothing from Grandmaster?

138
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,860
I am someone

139
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,900
with little curiosity or ambition.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,660
I just want to live comfortably.

141
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,050
Live?

142
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,900
As in, just keep breathing.

143
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,020
I sleep until I wake naturally every day,

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,220
eat well, sleep well.

145
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,420
Really?

146
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,810
Those immortal sects claim they cultivate

147
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,220
to save the world.

148
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,420
In truth, they all carry filthy desires.

149
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,690
You are different.

150
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,980
Even though you are bullied,

151
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,890
you still find your own comfort,

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,020
and stay true to yourself.

153
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,580
I doubt there is another disciple in these mountains

154
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,810
who can live as freely as you.

155
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,810
Are you talking about me?

156
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,730
I have learned

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,420
the art of speaking.

158
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,780
But

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,690
aren't you from the Gengchen Celestial Palace too?

160
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,460
Why do you talk

161
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,020
as if you are not one of them?

162
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,580
One of them?

163
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,860
I am just a stranger here.

164
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,180
From now on, we are friends.

165
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,580
Alright.

166
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,300
I actually came in without knocking.

167
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,770
Another tedious climb.

168
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,460
Can we please skip this part?

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,890
Follow me if you want to live.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,650
The road to work is too exhausting.

171
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,490
No benefits and no pay.

172
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,460
He is worse than a capitalist.

173
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,370
With my limited knowledge of fantasy world,

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,700
this must be valuable.

175
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,530
Boss.

176
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,180
Do you hear a child crying?

177
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,100
Come here every day and water this.

178
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,060
When it thrives,

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,980
I grow restless.

180
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,860
I grow murderous.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,300
Are you serious?

182
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,060
Will watering it not put out the flame on the flower?

183
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,490
If you manage to put it out,

184
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,410
that would be a great feat.

185
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,340
Come with me.

186
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,180
I thought the cultivation world

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,580
didn't have overtime.

188
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,340
I never thought it would be worse than my reality.

189
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,820
Where I come from, no overtime just means losing your job.

190
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,940
But here at Three Saints Mountain,

191
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,980
not working means losing my head.

192
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,730
What did I do to deserve this?

193
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,370
When will I ever

194
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,300
get rid of this demon?

195
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,010
What are you thinking?

196
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,530
Boss.

197
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,610
I'm thinking you could go do something else.

198
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,530
I won't slack off.

199
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,860
You keep saying "boss."

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,130
What exactly is a boss?

201
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,220
A boss is someone I keep working for,

202
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,770
and who keeps rewarding me.

203
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,610
How is that different from raising cattle?

204
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,670
That is an interesting view.

205
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,130
People at my home say the same thing.

206
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,980
Why don't you use spells to work?

207
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,650
Your cultivation is already low.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,180
You are barely at the Qi Forge stage.

209
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,940
[Foundation Rise, Coreform]
Above that is Foundation Rise, Coreform,

210
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,010
[Nascent Soul, Soulshift]
Nascent Soul and Soulshift.

211
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,180
[Void Forge, Unity Merge]
Then, Void Forge and Unity Merge.

212
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,980
[Grand Ascend, Tribulation Break]
Then, Grand Ascend and Tribulation Break.

213
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,860
[Tribulation Break]
You are at the very bottom.

214
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,530
Maybe the immortal officer who picked you

215
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,730
made a mistake.

216
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,220
That is why you got such an opportunity.

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,340
I guess my cultivation is low.

218
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,580
I'm not good at it.

219
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,620
I hurt my head before.

220
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,250
I forgot a lot of things.

221
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,940
You drank my blood.

222
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,220
Now you should at least be at Foundation Rise.

223
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,490
So I am already Foundation Rise?

224
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,610
I can do spells now.

225
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,700
She finally showed your Demon Realm identity.

226
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,100
At least she is more honest now.

227
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,410
Come here.

228
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,820
Why can I still not live an easy life in this world?

229
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,980
Other protagonists are destined heroines.

230
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,890
I'm just an overworked corporate grunt.

231
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,650
No money, no days off,

232
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,860
and I have to please the boss.

233
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,940
I typed on a keyboard every day.

234
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,060
Now I wipe with a rag!

235
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,010
Life without slacking is half the fun gone.

236
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,410
As if that is not enough,

237
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,530
I still have to deal with bratty kids.

238
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,060
You brat.

239
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,130
That hurt!

240
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,100
I will burn you!

241
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,770
You can talk?

242
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,220
Is there anything else talking here?

243
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,580
Calm down.

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,100
In the cultivation world, talking flames are normal.

245
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,730
Little flame.

246
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,460
I'm just following the boss's orders.

247
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,130
Please do not take it personally.

248
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,250
Little flame?

249
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,300
Do you know who I am?

250
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,730
Why should I care?

251
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,610
I must follow the boss's order.

252
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,340
Sorry, our sect specializes in farming.

253
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,650
Bear with me. I will be quick.

254
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,770
I may not beat Grandmaster,

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,180
but I can handle a little brat like you.

256
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,100
It feels like my body is being drained.

257
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,180
Why are kids in this world

258
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,530
so full of energy?

259
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,300
Climbing these stairs every day is killing me.

260
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,410
I'm working harder than an ox,

261
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,770
but no pay, no contract. This is pure exploitation.

262
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,530
At least the boss is rarely around.

263
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,370
And Black Serpent is easy to get along with.

264
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,060
The work target spits fire,

265
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,250
- but it is manageable. - That hurts!

266
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,820
Eat my flame!

267
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,610
Babysitting is no easy job.

268
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,250
Please, stop watering me.

269
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,700
I feel awful.

270
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,460
You can't even spit a spark.

271
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,060
That should be enough.

272
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,060
Sima Jiao said you are also from Gengchen Celestial Palace.

273
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,860
Then, do not water me again.

274
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,220
If I do not water you,

275
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,250
how do I explain it to my boss?

276
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,530
Are you not his woman?

277
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,610
Why would you need to deal with him?

278
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,460
And where did you

279
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,340
get that bright idea?

280
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,580
Anyone he brings here

281
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,940
is obviously his person.

282
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,860
You are a woman,

283
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,610
so you must be his woman.

284
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,610
Seems logical.

285
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,370
That logic is something else.

286
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,180
Sima Jiao, don't look at me like that.

287
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,220
Feeding the Fengshan Spirit Fire with your blood

288
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,820
is the fate of the Sima clan.

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,410
Don't think that refining my avatar

290
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,340
means you can escape me.

291
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,860
We live and die together.

292
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,130
This fate

293
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,370
will follow you forever.

294
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,180
Looking at it this way, Three Saints Mountain

295
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,580
isn't such a bad workplace.

296
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,460
The only downside is

297
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,460
that no one here eats or drinks.

298
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,940
I can't order takeout.

299
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,220
Life has lost a lot of fun because of that.

300
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,130
Again?

301
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,340
Boss.

302
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,820
Boss.

303
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,100
There should be some distance between ranks.

304
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,890
Nonsense.

305
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,740
Is this how you serve people?

306
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,500
I'm already doing my best.

307
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,740
Speaking of which,

308
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,450
we have never talked about

309
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,020
an employment contract.

310
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,370
There may be no labor laws here,

311
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,650
but proper benefits should still be a thing.

312
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,740
Go on.

313
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,540
What do you want?

314
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,970
I guess asking for a salary is impossible.

315
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,450
At least give me weekends off.

316
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,930
So after all that,

317
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,690
this is what you want.

318
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,970
No weekends? Okay.

319
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,260
One day off a week then.

320
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,060
Keep watering.

321
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,130
No slacking.

322
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,740
I heard you have been here for five hundred years.

323
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,970
Does staying in one place too long

324
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,780
make people or flames sick?

325
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,020
It is all Sima Jiao's fault.

326
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,500
Heartless scoundrel.

327
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,580
Always making fun of me.

328
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,970
Sima Jiao?

329
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,890
What?

330
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,580
Such a delicate-sounding name.

331
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,130
So different from the grandmaster.

332
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,130
Fool!

333
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,340
It is Jiao,

334
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,780
as in burnt.

335
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,300
Now that makes sense.

336
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,170
Why are you so irritable?

337
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,610
No wonder the boss says he wants to kill when you thrive.

338
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,890
That is a lie.

339
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,740
We do not share feelings.

340
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,890
You watering me and making me suffer

341
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,610
won't make him feel better.

342
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,370
Then, I'm working for nothing.

343
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,100
With such a good opportunity,

344
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,740
why not steal the Bloodseal Bloom?

345
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,610
Hey, you nasty, evil woman.

346
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,820
You know the truth and still water me?

347
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,020
Sorry.

348
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,970
Stop watering.

349
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,020
Between him

350
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,130
and your tiny evil force that spits sparks,

351
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,370
of course I will bow

352
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,450
to the greater evil of the boss.

353
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,060
That is how office politics works.

354
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,820
One day when I recover,

355
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,930
I will burn you into ashes

356
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,260
and scatter them in front of that cursed Sima Jiao.

357
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,580
My flower!

358
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,410
Sima Jiao!

359
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,890
I grew this flower with your blood.

360
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,860
Do you not feel

361
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,650
the least bit sorry for your own blood?

362
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,060
Pick it up.

363
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,890
Do you know what this is?

364
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,130
It is a flower.

365
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,780
Petals?

366
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,060
Do you want them?

367
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,740
You tore the flower apart.

368
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,100
What would I want them for?

369
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,370
Looks like you have no idea.

370
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,540
And they still let you in.

371
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,170
Yes.

372
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,210
No one told me anything.

373
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,370
I'm not that close with my master or seniors.

374
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,780
They don't know any secrets either.

375
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,930
Besides, the more you know, the faster you die.

376
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,210
The Petals are yours.

377
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,450
He isn't so generous to everyone.

378
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,860
Generous?

379
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,930
The petals are pretty.

380
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,130
But what can I even do with them?

381
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,540
You really have no idea?

382
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,650
This is a Fengshan Bloodseal Bloom.

383
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,890
One petal holds a thousand years of cultivation.

384
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,860
Everyone in Gengchen Celestial Palace

385
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,340
is desperate to get it.

386
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,300
This should count as wages.

387
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,170
Help me,

388
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,930
and I will give you more petals.

389
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,780
No thanks.

390
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,780
I'll pass.

391
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,300
Greed can kill you.

392
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,370
I wouldn't dare use

393
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,210
an item like this.

394
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,500
What if I can't handle it and just die?

395
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,690
That is a common trope in novels.

396
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,860
My work is done for today.

397
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,930
I'm off now.

398
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,500
Bye.

399
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,930
Don't go! Stay and talk to me!

400
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,210
You're leaving already?

401
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,740
I finished all my work.

402
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,580
Can't I leave?

403
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,300
Who said you're done?

404
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,580
Why open your mouth

405
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,930
and give yourself more work?

406
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,410
Follow me if you want to live.

407
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,580
No more chores for you today.

408
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,260
You just need to learn

409
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,690
a killing spell.

410
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,210
A killing spell?

411
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,690
Can I please not learn it?

412
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,890
Refuse, and I'll kill you.

413
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,650
Pick it up.

414
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,500
Draw it out.

415
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,540
Celestial Palace artifacts

416
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,340
must be infused with spiritual power

417
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,820
to be used.

418
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,260
But I don't have spiritual power.

419
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,170
Why do I have to learn to kill?

420
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,340
It will be useful in the future.

421
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,650
Grandmaster.

422
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,060
I'd like to confirm something with you.

423
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,650
So we don't misstep

424
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,740
in the future.

425
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,170
Speak.

426
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,340
Well...

427
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,650
You fed me your blood,

428
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,300
kept me by your side,

429
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,740
and are personally teaching me spells.

430
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,500
There are so many people on this mountain,

431
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,540
yet you're giving me so much attention.

432
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,820
Could it be...

433
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,170
that you like me?

434
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,930
You, a mere Foundation Rise fledgling,

435
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,860
talking to me about liking?

436
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,690
How laughable.

437
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,690
I look pretty decent right now.

438
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,450
At least I'm not laughable.

439
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,300
And what does liking have to do with cultivation stages?

440
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,860
Mortal romance

441
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,450
is beneath me.

442
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,170
Never say never.

443
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,820
An old house can catch fire in a flash.

444
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,650
Nonsense.

445
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,890
If not for your constitution

446
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,170
that tempers the Spirit Fire's

447
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,690
manic energy within me,

448
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,060
you think you'd still be alive?

449
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,540
So I'm basically a walking air conditioner.

450
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,130
Guess I was overthinking.

451
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,170
Sima Jiao really is emotionless.

452
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,100
Great.

453
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,210
Bye.

454
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,300
The piece is in place.

455
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,690
After 500 years,

456
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,170
it's finally coming to an end.

457
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,170
What is it?

458
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,130
I heard there's a disciple named Liao Tingyan

459
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,740
who walked straight into the Central Tower.

460
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,130
Mu Nisheng of the Heaven Palace saw it herself.

461
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,450
We've tried everything

462
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,130
yet couldn't get anywhere near Sima Jiao.

463
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,410
How did she manage it?

464
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,210
How she did it doesn't matter.

465
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,740
What matters is

466
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,500
that the barrier around the Central Tower

467
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,540
is unbreakable.

468
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,130
Yet that Liao Tingyan can come and go freely.

469
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,970
Could it be...

470
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,260
Could the barrier be gone?

471
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,690
If so,

472
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,780
we can finally make our move.

473
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,650
Tingyan has earned Sima Jiao's favour.

474
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,930
Earplugs. An overworked laborer's best friend.

475
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,060
Mr. Snake.

476
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,860
Didn't we agree?

477
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,020
When you come, just drink.

478
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,820
No need to wake me.

479
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,650
Don't wake me when you leave.

480
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,100
Because of you,

481
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,930
I haven't had

482
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,340
a full night's sleep in days.

483
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,060
A snake shouldn't be too polite, you know.

484
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,020
Get it?

485
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,690
Forget it.

486
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,300
You probably don't get it.

487
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,890
It's like after a long day of work,

488
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,890
an enthusiastic coworker drags you to dinner.

489
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,300
If I can't provoke you, I can avoid you.

490
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,020
Now, no one is interrupting my rest.

491
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,100
Mingli.

492
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,500
You dare threaten me?

493
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,540
Young Master, punctual as always.

494
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,540
Zip it.

495
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,100
Where is the antidote?

496
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,930
The barrier between us still stands.

497
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,890
The Spirit Fire hasn't gone out.

498
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,820
Sima Jiao is still alive and kicking.

499
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,930
How could I give it to you?

500
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,740
I've already sent her in.

501
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,260
Whether your plan succeeds

502
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,020
is up to your Demon Realm's luck.

503
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,930
What's it got to do with me?

504
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,060
Young Master.

505
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,210
We're supposed to be on the same boat here.

506
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,780
If you don't give me the antidote today,

507
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,540
I'll expose Liao Tingyan's identity

508
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,100
and ruin your whole plan.

509
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,130
Without Liao Tingyan,

510
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,410
the Demon Realm will survive just fine.

511
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,300
But you, Young Master...

512
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,650
Nothing the Celestial Palace hates more than a traitor tied to demons.

513
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,410
If your father found out

514
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,100
you colluded with us for power,

515
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,500
what would happen?

516
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,260
Right from the start,

517
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,580
you only pretended to help me advance,

518
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,780
just to lower my guard.

519
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,820
Then, you used demon poison to control me

520
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,060
and make me do your bidding.

521
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,610
It's been a setup from the very beginning!

522
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,340
Young Master,

523
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,540
that's not a fair way to put it.

524
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,260
You were the one who came to us for an alliance.

525
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,970
Right now, the only thing you can do

526
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,500
is find a way to make Liao Tingyan act fast.

527
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,740
Oh no, not again.

528
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,580
Liao Tingyan.

529
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,020
What are you doing?

530
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,500
If I ask Tingyan to help me

531
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,580
get close to Sima Jiao,

532
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,580
will she think I only befriended her

533
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,890
with an ulterior motive?

534
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,690
But if I still can't kill Sima Jiao,

535
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,060
my family will...

536
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,340
Why is the Black Serpent here?

537
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,890
That is where Tingyan lives.

538
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,170
Could it be...

539
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,060
Help!

540
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,130
Tingyan!

541
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,540
This can't be good.

542
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,410
That beast...

543
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,450
You bully because you have backing

544
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,210
from the Grandmaster.

545
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,340
You just do whatever you please.

546
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,930
Liao Tingyan did nothing to you.

547
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,930
Why devour her?

548
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,170
Spit her out, now.

549
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,100
Fine.

550
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,100
Since you refuse to comply,

551
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,500
then I won't hold back.

552
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,970
Did I just pass out from the pain?

553
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,340
Stubborn beast.

554
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,370
Not even an ibuprofen pill around.

555
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,060
Ibuprofen...

556
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,740
Isn't Grandmaster's blood basically ibuprofen?

557
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,450
Mr. Snake, what's wrong with you?

558
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,740
Tingyan, you're still alive.

559
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,930
Ruling?

560
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,120
I was about to ask you,

561
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,520
how did you end up climbing out of Mr. Snake's belly?

562
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,260
I thought it ate you and tried to save you.

563
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,300
But I ended up getting swallowed myself.

564
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,690
Ruling.

565
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,690
You actually risked

566
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,610
becoming Mr. Snake's dinner for me.

567
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,890
I took its serpent heart.

568
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,690
Maybe there's been some misunderstanding.

569
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,820
Mr. Snake actually isn't bad.

570
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,540
Maybe...

571
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,300
Maybe it meant no harm.

572
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,060
But I think it's too used to throwing its weight around.

573
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,820
As for the serpent heart...

574
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,500
I'll keep it for you for now.

575
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,970
If you dare scare people again,

576
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,130
I'll make sure you spend your life

577
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,210
as a little black serpent without a heart.

578
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,610
You were trapped in the snake's belly like a dark cell.

579
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,930
I'm trapped in a dark cell here in the Central Tower.

580
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,970
Life is just too hard.

581
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,300
But isn't Grandmaster quite fond of you?

582
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,780
I was even hoping to ride your coattails

583
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,210
and take care of him too.

584
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,740
Where did that rumor even come from?

585
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,140
Fond of me?

586
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,700
He's just squeezing every bit of labor out of me.

587
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,050
Why would you want to please him?

588
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,410
Why not?

589
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,660
Or is it that you don't want to introduce me to him?

590
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,010
That's right, I don't.

591
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,450
That man has a stable streak of madness.

592
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,740
If he gets upset, he might kill you.

593
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm not about to push my friend

594
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,410
into a fire pit.

595
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,450
So you're worried about me?

596
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,820
I thought...

597
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,970
Never mind.

598
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,660
Had your serpent heart taken?

599
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,220
Who's going to stand up for you?

600
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,010
The night of the new moon is coming.

601
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,370
The day we leave the mountain

602
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,970
is nigh.

603
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,010
Mr. Snake, you're here.

604
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,740
Please, have a seat.

605
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,450
Mr. Snake, I wanted to ask you something.

606
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,090
You've been with Grandmaster for so long.

607
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,820
You must know his likes and dislikes.

608
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,660
How would one go about pleasing him?

609
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,370
Grandmaster, look at this table.

610
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,780
I polished it until it shines.

611
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,970
And the floor,

612
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,530
not a speck of dust.

613
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,300
What do you want from me today?

614
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,380
Last night my stomach hurt again.

615
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,240
It hurt so much I thought I would die.

616
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,890
Didn't you save me with your blood last time?

617
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,820
What do you want?

618
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,860
I want you on call.

619
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,780
To donate blood for free.

620
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,970
I just mean,

621
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,700
from now on, could you use

622
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,090
your precious and treasured blood

623
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,220
to save me in time when I'm in trouble?

624
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,220
After all, this little body of mine

625
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,220
can still be useful to you.

626
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,570
We can help each other, right?

627
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,140
You're bargaining with me.

628
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,300
I wouldn't dare.

629
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,220
It's a plea.

630
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,340
You want my blood?

631
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,050
It depends on my mood.

632
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,340
So what would put you in a good mood?

633
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,180
You poor thing,

634
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,450
you even have to think about that?

635
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,930
Kill.

636
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,370
Kill someone for me.

637
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,700
Isn't that a bit above my pay grade?

638
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,890
Grandmaster, don't leave.

639
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,410
Just wait.

640
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,450
I'll find out what else you need.

641
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,010
Grandmaster.

642
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,220
You've worked hard all morning.

643
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,530
Let me serve you.

644
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,140
I heard you have trouble sleeping.

645
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,010
From my years of work experience,

646
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,410
it's most likely caused by too much worry and stress.

647
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,090
Mr. Snake.

648
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,740
So what would make Grandmaster happy?

649
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,820
Grandmaster likes pillows?

650
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,490
He can't sleep well?

651
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,570
He can't fall asleep?

652
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,530
Ridiculous.

653
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,490
What could possibly trouble me?

654
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,490
Anyway, I've brought a three-piece stress relief set.

655
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,370
With my special massage technique,

656
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,780
why not give it a try?

657
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,780
So you're finally making your move.

658
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,620
Relax, okay?

659
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,930
Boss.

660
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,780
See how

661
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,530
I'm serving you with such sincerity?

662
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,180
I'm only

663
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,370
going to discuss

664
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,930
about my benefits.

665
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,490
Can we renegotiate them?

666
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,530
What benefits?

667
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,180
It's about my blood again?

668
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,050
That's right.

669
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,740
Also,

670
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,370
I've been working five days straight.

671
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,620
Five straight days without a break.

672
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,370
Not to mention two days off, I don't even get one.

673
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,780
How can you be so shameless?

674
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,570
How am I shameless again?

675
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,050
Pleasing the boss is so hard.

676
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,090
If I'd known earlier,

677
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,570
I would've learned more tricks from my coworkers.

678
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,450
That Demon Realm spy

679
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,300
eased quite a bit

680
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,660
of the Spirit Fire's burn.

681
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,220
Maybe

682
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,780
I can force the seal open.

683
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,890
Sima Jiao, are you insane?

684
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,820
If you keep acting recklessly, it can kill you!

685
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,180
