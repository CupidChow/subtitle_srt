- Welcome! - Welcome!

25
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,370
The original form of the Winter City Lord

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,850
is actually a black serpent.

27
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,570
Do you think when he takes human form,

28
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,970
he's just as imposing?

29
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,740
I see you've got your eyes on his cultivation again.

30
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,900
Shh. Don't let anyone hear that.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,180
Can't believe the leader has such a pretty face.

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,300
He's quite good-looking.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,340
Here's the deal.

34
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,690
The man is yours, the serpent is mine.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,220
What are you on about?

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,250
This black serpent lord is amazing.

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,220
In just ten days,

38
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,370
he's taken nearly ten cities in the Demon Realm.

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,340
Exactly.

40
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,060
After all, behind him

41
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,900
is the Grandmaster of the Celestial Palace, Sima Jiao.

42
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,340
He's Sima Jiao?

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,410
We mustn't speak the Lord of Mercy's name directly.

44
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,300
I thought this would be a good fate.

45
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,500
Turns out he's your archenemy.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,900
Isn't Sima Jiao supposed to be

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,570
a gigantic, grotesque monster?

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,780
Why does he look like a pretty boy?

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,570
Qianlv.

50
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,410
Qiandu.

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,570
What happened to you?

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,250
All because of Sima Jiao.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,130
I'm forced to live in this pathetic way.

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,250
What about you?

55
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,900
Your journey

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,980
must've been full of dangers.

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,690
I've been avoiding the demonic cultivators all along the way.

58
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,370
I heard

59
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,540
Sima Jiao has already entered the Celestial Crane City.

60
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,130
He came fast.

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,570
Sima Jiao has fused with the new Spirit Fire.

62
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,330
He's stronger than before.

63
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,210
Along the way,

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,130
he's killed many of our clan.

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,980
I believe he'll find us in no time.

66
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,940
Qiandu, no matter how powerful Sima Jiao is,

67
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,210
he still can't withstand

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,180
someone we hold against him.

69
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,300
Do you mean

70
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,660
Liao Tingyan?

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,420
Exactly.

72
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,010
Liao Tingyan possesses the extreme-cold nature

73
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,570
that can suppress Sima Jiao's Spirit Fire?

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,130
That's right.

75
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,860
After I brought her to the Demon Realm,

76
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,210
I performed the Soul Cleanse Spell

77
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,420
to erase her memory,

78
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,690
so she could be of use to me.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,810
No wonder you didn't kill her eighteen years ago.

80
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,940
You brought her here instead.

81
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,420
But why didn't her cold constitution

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,100
affect Sima Jiao at all,

83
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,810
even after staying with him

84
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,940
so long?

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,100
She seemed to have forgotten how to use her extreme-cold nature.

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,500
That's why I have to cleanse her marrow regularly

87
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,690
to awaken her cold constitution,

88
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,370
so she'll be ready to kill Sima Jiao.

89
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,940
Father, I'm home.

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,500
You're back, Yan.

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,370
We have a guest?

92
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,050
Oh, you may continue your chat.

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,570
I... I forgot to buy vinegar.

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,570
Come here.

95
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,980
Let me introduce.

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,300
My younger sister. Your aunt.

97
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,620
She's always cared for you

98
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,740
and came specially to see you.

99
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,660
I thought this old grump was seeing someone.

100
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:49,690
Really?

101
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,010
Come.

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,250
I watched you grow up.

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,060
Right. I remember now.

104
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,300
You came at the right time, Aunt.

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,740
Tonight, I'll prepare

106
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,330
the specialties of the Celestial Crane City.

107
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,950
You can try them.

108
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,060
No need.

109
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,890
As long as the Shi family's unavenged,

110
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,060
how can I rest?

111
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,010
Father,

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,330
you've heard

113
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,940
that Sima Jiao has claimed the Celestial Crane City, haven't you?

114
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,290
Yes.

115
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,850
But this isn't a bad thing.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,090
This is your chance.

117
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,330
He's powerful.

118
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,220
I'd be dead if I confronted him.

119
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,940
Don't worry.

120
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,770
It won't happen.

121
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,450
Your aunt came

122
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,060
to help

123
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,260
cleanse your marrow

124
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,450
to awaken your extreme-cold nature quickly.

125
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,180
Your strike is sure to succeed.

126
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,090
Again?

127
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,940
It really works.

128
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,060
We have to stop here.

129
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,100
Zhenxu was killed by Sima Jiao.

130
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,690
How I hate that I can't avenge him myself.

131
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,570
You've done your best, Qianlv.

132
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,730
Though her extreme-cold nature

133
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,850
isn't fully awakened,

134
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,020
it has greatly improved.

135
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,970
Besides, Sima Jiao still has feelings

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,420
for her.

137
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,450
He won't suspect her.

138
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,850
I believe she'll succeed.

139
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,540
I'm not worried about her skill.

140
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,260
I'm worried she won't be able to bring herself to do it.

141
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,730
In that case...

142
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,210
With this Nightmare Spell,

143
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,020
let's hope she can steel herself to take revenge.

144
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,610
What are you doing early this morning?

145
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,450
Father, I dreamed of Zhenxu last night.

146
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,850
It filled me with rage.

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,490
I wish I could find Sima Jiao

148
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,490
and kill him now.

149
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,810
At least my efforts weren't for nothing.

150
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,690
Father, my power has grown stronger.

151
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,060
I might hurt you.

152
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,780
May I go stretch outside?

153
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,450
Go, but don't cause any trouble.

154
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,810
Come back early.

155
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,300
All right.

156
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,450
Looks like he bought it.

157
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,140
Last night's nightmare was probably his doing.

158
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,490
All he can think about is revenge.

159
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,900
Wasn't this Yingluo necklace broken

160
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,260
during the thunder tribulation?

161
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,060
How is it even more beautiful now?

162
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,300
This artifact

163
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,660
can withstand all harm.

164
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,450
Tingyan.

165
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,260
Tingyan!

166
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,570
Tingyan!

167
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,690
Grandmaster, the city lord of the Celestial Crane City

168
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,300
invites us to a banquet.

169
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,940
Will you go?

170
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,420
No.

171
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,210
Then I'll stay and keep your company.

172
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,450
Don't bother me.

173
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,570
Don't worry, Grandmaster.

174
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,420
We caused such a commotion

175
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,900
claiming the Celestial Crane City,

176
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,490
and I showed my true form.

177
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,900
I believe

178
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,210
Tingyan will come to us soon.

179
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,180
But I'm not good at waiting.

180
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,690
I'm really good at lying low.

181
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,540
I can't wait to take my father

182
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,730
to Grain Rain Vale right now to hide.

183
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,140
Hands off.

184
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,450
Tube whistles like this one are everywhere.

185
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,810
Why do you care so much about it?

186
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,900
I don't know.

187
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,970
I just feel it's important to me.

188
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Right now, what matters most to me is saving enough money

189
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,810
and taking my father to Grain Rain Vale.

190
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,020
How about this?

191
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,730
I'll cover the rest.

192
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,180
I'll give you all my savings.

193
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,570
That should be enough.

194
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,380
Then we can leave together.

195
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,390
Haven't you been focused on restoring your cultivation?

196
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,330
Why do you also want to leave?

197
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,300
In a place full of debauchery,

198
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,020
improving my cultivation is only for self-protection.

199
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,660
If not for my poor health,

200
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,450
I would never have stayed here.

201
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,090
If you give me the money meant to buy your freedom,

202
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,260
how will you get out of there?

203
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,300
Isn't the city lord of the Winter City

204
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,420
a black serpent?

205
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,330
As long as I can get him on my side,

206
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,140
no one will dare stop me

207
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,180
from leaving this Rouge Terrace.

208
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,970
All right. I'll persuade my father right away.

209
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,020
I'll repay you the money slowly.

210
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,540
Don't treat me like an outsider.

211
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,970
Come on.

212
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,780
Please visit us more often.

213
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,610
Fill up.

214
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,020
- Please drink, my lord. - Fill his cup.

215
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,180
- My lord, come. - Let's drink.

216
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,300
Let's drink together.

217
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,610
Welcome, my lord.

218
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,140
- I should've greeted you earlier. - I should've greeted you earlier.

219
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,810
- Come on. - Please.

220
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,780
Please visit us more often.

221
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,900
My lord,

222
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,420
let me toast you again.

223
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,940
Pour more.

224
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,610
Please.

225
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,180
Since you're here, let's all drink together.

226
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,570
- A toast to you. - Let's drink.

227
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,300
Come.

228
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,780
Wonderful.

229
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,060
Please drink, my lord.

230
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,490
My lord, I'll give you a toast.

231
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,140
My lord,

232
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,180
this is the most beautiful dancer here.

233
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,140
Bravo!

234
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,970
- Bravo! - She's so beautiful.

235
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,540
Another drink.

236
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,140
Ruling,

237
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,900
do I miss you this much?

238
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,940
My lord...

239
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,060
Prepare a quiet room for me.

240
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,780
Here's a toast to you.

241
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,380
Let me refill your cup.

242
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,860
[Zhihun Ji]

243
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,920
[Zhihun Yi]

244
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,860
You're such a good drinker.

245
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,820
Have another drink.

246
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,580
Father.

247
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,140
I have something to discuss with you.

248
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,730
What is it?

249
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,820
I plan to take you to Grain Rain Vale.

250
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,210
I've nearly saved enough for the journey.

251
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,380
Once we're there, you can rest and recover in peace.

252
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,010
Do you mean

253
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,300
to cast our revenge aside?

254
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,650
You keep saying how cruel Sima Jiao is,

255
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,730
and that you must avenge Zhenxu.

256
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,300
You should think of your daughter who still lives.

257
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,010
Why must you force me

258
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,490
into an impossible task?

259
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,100
Come here.

260
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,300
Come.

261
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,860
Spare me your nonsense.

262
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,860
Do you forget

263
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,100
who killed your brother?

264
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,650
Who ruined me like this?

265
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,450
Who destroyed the Shi family?

266
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,820
I raised you all these years,

267
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,410
and now you say I force you?

268
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,010
You disappoint me.

269
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,540
Father, I only wish for our future.

270
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,860
Please go with me.

271
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,410
We can talk about the revenge later.

272
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,100
Shut up.

273
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,420
Until Sima Jiao is dead, we have no future.

274
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,480
- Father... - Enough!

275
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,540
Instead of wasting words,

276
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,340
reflect on yourself.

277
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,010
Yan.

278
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,620
Something happened.

279
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,410
My Hongluo.

280
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,380
If you've cleaned up everything, you may leave.

281
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,210
Yan.

282
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,250
How about this?

283
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,650
I'll cover the rest.

284
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,970
I'll give you all my savings.

285
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,450
That should be enough.

286
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,450
Then we can leave together.

287
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,490
If I die here one day,

288
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,060
can you see to my burial?

289
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,650
I don't want my body

290
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,690
sold to corpse-refiners

291
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,380
and made into something weird.

292
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,340
Sure.

293
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,300
What's your name?

294
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,970
Call me Yan.

295
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,380
Once I've saved enough,

296
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,900
I'll take you and my father

297
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,210
to Grain Rain Vale

298
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,380
to live a free and comfortable life.

299
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,730
Grain Rain Vale?

300
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,580
That's a place that only appears in legend.

301
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,210
I've never heard of anyone going there.

302
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,410
I didn't know where I came from

303
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,340
or who my parents were.

304
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,010
But with a true friend like you,

305
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,580
I'm happy.

306
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,010
If I don't support you, who will?

307
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,700
It's so good to have you.

308
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,780
I kept my word, didn't I?

309
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,340
Was it the black serpent?

310
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,820
They say his two underlings

311
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,970
forced themselves on her when the city lord was drunk.

312
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,820
Hongluo fought with all she had,

313
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,380
but couldn't win.

314
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,750
Live on well.

315
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,030
Hurry up and get yourselves ready before we leave.

316
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,560
We need to get back to Winter City.

317
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,560
- Alright. - Alright. Let's go.

318
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,270
- Sure. - I'm going to take a leak.

319
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,270
Let's go.

320
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,270
Come.

321
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,710
Once we're back in Winter City, there'll be good liquor and meat waiting.

322
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,080
Yi, that dancer from last night wasn't as good after all.

323
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:16,750
Right.

324
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,030
If she hadn't fought back,

325
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,230
we could've let her live.

326
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,990
I thought some tough guy ambushed us.

327
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,160
Turns out just a brat.

328
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,920
Why attack us?

329
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,750
Because you killed someone you shouldn't have.

330
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,320
That dancer is your woman, eh?

331
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,600
You're here to avenge her?

332
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,120
She was the only peace I had.

333
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,030
You took her life. Now pay with yours!

334
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,080
You're way over your head.

335
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,400
Ji!

336
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,840
How does it feel losing family?

337
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,030
I'll kill you!

338
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,400
I'll have nightmares again.

339
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,400
My lord.

340
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,990
We're not in a rush.

341
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,470
I've had the men head back to Winter City first.

342
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,360
Please drink some water and rest.

343
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,680
Next time I drink again,

344
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,030
stop me.

345
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,510
Don't just enjoy yourself.

346
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,880
Yes.

347
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,160
I was too happy last night.

348
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,360
I smell blood.

349
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,230
Who dares ambush my men?

350
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,590
Darn it.

351
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,190
Playing tricks with me?

352
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,750
This black serpent has a dog's nose.

353
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,160
I've run so far,

354
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,560
and he still smells blood.

355
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,750
Tingyan?

356
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,920
It's you.

357
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,400
Let go of me.

358
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:48,930
Let go.

359
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,790
- Grandmaster. - Let go.

360
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,510
Grandmaster, look who I brought here.

361
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,190

What's going on with him?

374
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,990
Aren't we supposed to be enemies?

375
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,640
It feels...

376
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,510
What do I feel drowsy at such a critical moment?

377
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,880
What's happening?

378
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,270
It's the perfect chance to strike.

379
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,600
Oh no!

380
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,400
Sima Jiao will grind me to dust.

381
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,160
Who have you been with all these years?

382
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,270
An old man named Shi Qianlv.

383
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,470
I call him Father.

384
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,120
Shi Qianlv?

385
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,920
You call him Father?

386
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,990
What has he done to you?

387
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,080
He cleanses my marrow and teaches me to kill.

388
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,320
Why didn't you come back to me?

389
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,400
We're archenemies.

390
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,560
Why would I deliver myself to death?

391
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,510
This fellow has a spell to make someone speak the truth?

392
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,880
You forget everything.

393
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,880
This must be Shi Qianlv's doing.

394
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,880
Tell me where he is.

395
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,600
I won't betray him.

396
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,790
Listen well.

397
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,510
Your name is Liao Tingyan.

398
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,840
You're my cultivation partner.

399
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,160
You have nothing to do with that man.

400
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,880
Shi Qianlv actually made you call him Father?

401
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,320
He think he deserves it?

402
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,510
He's only using you against me.

403
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,600
Do you understand?

404
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,230
Cultivation partner?

405
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,120
Are you sure we're not enemies?

406
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,710
Sorry.

407
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,950
I was ahead of myself just now.

408
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,680
I won't force answers out of you again.

409
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,160
Why is he being so gentle with me?

410
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:25,950
It's fine.

411
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,190
We'll have plenty of time later.

412
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,640
Something feels wrong.

413
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,400
I need to observe.

414
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,270
Where is she?

415
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,710
Where is she?

416
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,420
How dare you

417
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,160
kill my men

418
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,470
and hurt Grandmaster!

419
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,510
I'm going to kill you!

420
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,640
- Hand her over! - Hand the murderer over!

421
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,920
- Hand her over! - Hand her over!

422
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,030
Hand over the murderer!

423
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,120
- Hand her over! - This is the Zhihun clan's internal matter.

424
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,430
Hand over the murderer.

425
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,890
Winter City was founded

426
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,360
by the Zhihun clan a thousand years ago.

427
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,380
[Head of Zhihun clan]

428
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,710
Though the city is your territory now,

429
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,840
the victims are our clansmen,

430
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,190
and this is our family matter.

431
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,380
So, the murderer

432
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,840
must be handed over to us.

433
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,430
- That's right. Hand her over. - Hand her over.

434
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,230
Hand her over now.

435
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,470
Unfortunately,

436
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,360
this matter

437
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,530
happens to my family affair, too.

438
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,710
Why don't we settle it by the Demon Realm's rules?

439
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,920
The stronger

440
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,840
has the say.

441
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,840
What do you think?

442
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,320
You killed someone?

443
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,150
So what?

444
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,390
If you hadn't ambushed us,

445
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,840
you could never have killed my men

446
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,950
with your Soulbud stage.

447
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,430
She fell from Void Forge to Soulbud.

448
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,520
Was she injured at that time?

449
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,270
Grandmaster, this wench...

450
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,150
Isn't he defending his enemy too much?

451
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,710
Why did you kill?

452
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,750
My best friend was killed by those two men.

453
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,640
I had to avenge her.

454
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,150
I once forced you to kill.

455
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,120
But you cried and had nightmares.

456
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,710
Why has Shi Qianlv

457
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,000
done to you?

458
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,960
In this world,

459
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,480
how can one survive without killing?

460
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,150
I promised you

461
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,190
I'd never force you to kill,

462
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,640
and you'd never need to kill again.

463
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,870
I won't break my word.

464
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,670
Regarding this matter,

465
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,120
I'll handle

466
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,270
those outside.

467
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,190
You don't have to do anything.

468
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,350
The two men had already paid for their price.

469
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,350
They are already dead,

470
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,440
and their clan is innocent.

471
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,400
But I can feel

472
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,560
your hatred

473
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,440
still remains.

474
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,120
If you only wish

475
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,830
to kill to vent your anger,

476
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,640
I can revive them

477
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,750
and let them die again.

478
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,150
If you can revive them,

479
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,870
can you also bring Hongluo back?

480
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,710
If you wish,

481
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,710
yes.

482
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,750
But your friend has lost her body.

483
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,520
I could only use Soul Transfer Spell

484
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,120
to let her be reborn.

485
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,480
Reborn?

486
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,350
That's not resurrection.

487
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,080
That's reincarnation.

488
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,350
Not quite.

489
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,190
Through the Soul Transfer Spell,

490
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,400
you get to see her quickly,

491
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,790
and after she's reborn,

492
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,440
she retains her past memories and feelings.

493
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,150
Her death

494
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,600
is like a dream.

495
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,790
That's great. I can see Hongluo again.

496
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,040
Is Hongluo truly this important

497
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,830
to you?

498
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,870
She was my best friend in the Demon Realm.

499
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,230
The only one who treated me sincerely.

500
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,600
Thank you.

501
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,150
I once treated you sincerely, too.

502
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,870
It doesn't matter if you don't remember.

503
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,710
As long as you're here.

504
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:07,920
My lord,

505
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,710
why is Grandmaster siding

506
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,830
with some stranger?

507
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,640
What stranger?

508
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,750
She's no stranger.

509
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,150
She's my friend

510
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,600
and the Grandmistress.

511
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,190
Grandmistress?

512
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,840
Greetings, Grandmaster.

513
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,870
Please hand over the murderer to us

514
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,480
for judgment.

515
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,640
And what about the woman

516
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,040
killed by the Zhihun brothers?

517
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,830
Grandmaster has shown you mercy

518
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,920
by not holding you accountable.

519
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:56,920
Now leave.

520
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,440
Bring Shi Qianlv to me.

521
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,710
Shi Qianlv?

522
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,080
What did he do again?

523
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,350
Capture him alive.

524
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,190
Don't let him die so easily.

525
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,350
Yes, Grandmaster.

526
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,440
Grandmaster.

527
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,270
Stop staring. Go.

528
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,870
Why are you following me?

529
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,640
Grandmaster,

530
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,830
did Tingyan accidentally hurt you?

531
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,790
Your hand...

532
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,350
Let me call Baizhu

533
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,400
to tend your wound.

534
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,920
No need.

535
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,120
It's useless.

536
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,350
Grandmaster,

537
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,920
since you fused the two Spirit Fires,

538
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,350
your power has grown,

539
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,830
but the backlash is worse.

540
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,790
Wounds won't heal easily.

541
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,790
Enough nonsense.

542
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm going to perform the Soul Transfer Spell.

543
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,830
Guard me.

544
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,790
Grandmaster,

545
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,920
it'll exhaust you.

546
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,150
You just took your heart-protecting bone not long ago

547
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,210
to forge a defensive anklet for Tingyan.

548
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,350
I know what I'm doing.

549
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,310
All right.

550
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,400
I'll guard you.

551
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,520
Sima Jiao defends Yan so much

552
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,190
that he even lets others call her Grandmistress.

553
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,310
Did you see clearly?

554
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,870
Yes, I did. It's Yan.

555
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,640
Sima Jiao loves Liao Tingyan deeply.

556
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,440
How could he have found

557
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,710
a new love so quickly?

558
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,790
I suspect Yan is actually Liao Tingyan.

559
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,350
That's great.

560
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,790
But

561
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,640
Winter City is now under Sima Jiao's control.

562
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,000
We must find a way

563
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,440
to get Liao Tingyan out of there first.

564
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,190
Only then can we use her to forge the artifact.

565
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,310
You've kept in contact with the orphan

566
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:46,960
of General Chang, haven't you?

567
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,400
Yes.

568
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,000
Now he goes by the name Feng Qi

569
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,600
and works as a guard in the Celestial Crane City.

570
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,310
As you instructed,

571
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,000
I've also assigned him some minor tasks.

572
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,150
He's close with Yan.

573
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,710
It's time to put him to use.
