Father, you've said this many times.

To secure his position in the Celestial Palace,

58
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,050
he used false charges

59
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,380
to destroy whoever defied him.

60
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,980

The battle of Taiwei Mountain

65

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,260
Nothing to do with Miss Hongluo.

188
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,890
The process may be unpleasant.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,740
Please step outside.

190
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,410
Let's leave.

191
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,020
Madam,

192
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,170
let's go.

193
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,770
- Will this really work? - Go.

194
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,500
- Alright. - I'll leave it to you.

195
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,050
Grandmaster,

196
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,620
everywhere in the Demon Realm is harsh and hostile.

197
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,220
Please endure it for now.

198
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,530
Let's rest here in Winter City.

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,810
Yes!

200
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,530
I conjured this with the cultivation

201
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,290
you helped me improve.

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,220
Do you like it?

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,170
I helped raise your cultivation,

204
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,980
and this is what you use it for?

205
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,890
This will put a smile on your face,

206
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,500
isn't it worth it?

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,290
Grandmaster, I believe

208
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,530
Tingyan wouldn't want

209
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,100
to see you upset.

210
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,380
What were you drawing?

211
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,530
It's called an emoticon.

212
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,050
My secret code.

213
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,290
Cute, isn't it?

214
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,050
Tingyan...

215
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,220
She's not dead.

216
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,770
How is it, Grandmaster?

217
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,100
Why can't I sense her presence?

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,620
Could it be concealed?

219
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,570
Anyway, she's still alive.

220
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,770
We agreed on this. It's on you.

221
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,870
Yes, of course.

222
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,570
Fifteen demon stones are a lot.

223
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,530
I couldn't have made this much

224
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,690
without your help.

225
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,140
True.

226
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,690
If the stingy madam found out

227
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,860
we pretended not to know each other

228
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,930
and raised the price together,

229
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,340
she'd be livid.

230
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,380
Hongluo.

231
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,460
You never used to kill.

232
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,410
What happened with that Second Young Master?

233
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,220
He killed my friend from Rouge Terrace.

234
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,340
At first,

235
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,980
I only wanted to drain his yang energy

236
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,810
to make him suffer.

237
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,980
Who knew he'd have the strength to strike back?

238
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,740
In a fit of rage, I...

239
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,290
I've already held back myself.

240
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,100
Don't be afraid. It's cleaned up now.

241
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,020
This place is full of filthy business.

242
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,690
Celestial Crane City may sound elegant,

243
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,140
but it's not a place to live for long.

244
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,930
Once I've saved enough,

245
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,170
I'll take you and my father

246
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,740
to Grain Rain Vale.

247
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,810
We'll live free and comfortably there.

248
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,770
Grain Rain Vale?

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,650
That's a place that only appears in legend.

250
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,740
I've never heard of anyone going there.

251
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,890
I think

252
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,410
that's just a tale to fool children.

253
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,020
You don't know.

254
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,220
I heard reliable news in the black market

255
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,220
that Grain Rain Vale is real.

256
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,170
It's just that it costs a great price to get there.

257
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,100
Two thousand demon stones.

258
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,170
Right.

259
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,570
That's why you work so hard.

260
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,220
Didn't you say

261
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,810
you're not Shi Yan

262
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,410
and you came from some other world?

263
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,690
I can't understand

264
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,890
what you mean,

265
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,740
but

266
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,860
your father

267
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,860
isn't your real father.

268
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,410
Still, he raised me all these years.

269
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,570
Besides,

270
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,460
he did save my life.

271
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,260
You carry the aura of the Celestial Palace.

272
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,220
Why don't you hand over your inner core

273
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,890
and let us drink with it?

274
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,460
Father.

275
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:11,980
Yan.

276
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,660
Run now. I'll hold them off.

277
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,460
No, I won't leave you.

278
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,460
Go!

279
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,740
Run!

280
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,020
Father.

281
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,090
You're frail.

282
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,850
Don't risk yourself for me again.

283
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,530
I've already lost Zhenxu.

284
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,660
I can't lose you too.

285
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,290
Father.

286
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,020
His legs were crippled ever since.

287
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,050
I can't abandon him.

288
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,330
In that case,

289
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,980
do this job well,

290
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,020
and I'll recommend you to Rouge Terrace?

291
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,530
You can work as a guard like Feng Qi. What do you think?

292
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,090
You'll get demon stones every month.

293
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,850
Wouldn't that bring you closer

294
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,660
to your goal?

295
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,290
It's so nice to have you.

296
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,810
Come on, we're friends.

297
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,010
When the madam found me,

298
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,290
my spirit sense was damaged.

299
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,130
I didn't know where I came from

300
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,380
or who my parents were.

301
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,610
But with a true friend like you,

302
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,130
I'm happy.

303
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,130
If I don't support you, who will?

304
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,050
It's so good to have you.

305
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,900
Nianjiu,

306
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,290
how long have you been with me?

307
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,090
Nearly 400 years, I suppose.

308
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,660
It's time to be independent.

309
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,330
No time like the present.

310
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,330
This place may be small,

311
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,530
but it could be your beginning.

312
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,260
Grandmaster,

313
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,090
I never have such thoughts.

314
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,610
I wish to stay at your side forever.

315
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,460
This isn't up to you.

316
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,150
[Winter City Lord Residence]

317
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,610
Take Winter City.

318
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,500
I want to tell her I'm here

319
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,460
in my way.

320
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,220
That way,

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,420
we kill two birds with one stone.

322
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,290
We can find Tingyan

323
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,420
and give the refugee from the Celestial Palace

324
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,460
shelter.

325
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,290
You're wise, Grandmaster.

326
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,940
This year, the Demon Lord demands

327
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,850
even more tribute.

328
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,810
His power is beyond everyone.

329
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,770
We can only obey.

330
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,480
[Niu San, Winter City Lord]

331
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,220
What's happening outside?

332
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,850
This is bad, my lord!

333
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,500
Two strangers

334
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,660
barged into the mansion

335
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,370
and defeated all our men.

336
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,180
Dozens of you defeated by just two?

337
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,740
Who's got the guts?

338
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,420
Take me to them.

339
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,090
Surrender the city,

340
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,570
and we will deal with the Demon Lord for you.

341
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,050
Release my men first, then I'll consider it.

342
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,260
Well? What have you decided?

343
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,740
Grandmaster,

344
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,420
all the demon soldiers have surrendered. Winter City has no leader now.

345
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,660
Please take charge.

346
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,740
You take the lead.

347
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,260
I'm open-minded.

348
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,050
Those who wish to stay,

349
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,260
from now on, we are as close as brothers.

350
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,420
For those who don't,

351
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,180
you may leave now.

352
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,900
I won't leave.

353
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,940
I, Niu San,

354
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,980
will follow the new city lord,

355
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,500
even at the cost of my life.

356
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,290
We will follow the new city lord,

357
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,810
even at the cost of our lives.

358
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,500
Alright, that's enough.

359
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,220
You may leave.

360
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,610
Yes, my lord.

361
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,330
What's going on?

362
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,330
What's going on?

363
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,940
My lord,

364
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,290
did they serve you poorly?

365
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,330
I'll fetch others to serve you.

366
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,740
That's not what I meant.

367
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,700
Niu San,

368
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,810
you're kind of strange, though.

369
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,130
Tell me.

370
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,570
Why did you submit so easily?

371
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,660
My lord,

372
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,500
the Demon Race admires the strong.

373
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,570
No matter who you are, as long as you can fight,

374
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,740
you deserve to lead.

375
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,290
Young man,

376
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,130
there's something I've long meant to say.

377
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,980
We people here may be loose in manner,

378
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,810
but there are rules we must follow.

379
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,460
The city lord is here.

380
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,850
How can a sidekick act

381
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,570
so arrogantly?

382
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,180
Shut it.

383
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,330
Niu San, are you out of your mind?

384
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,940
My Lord,

385
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,050
how would you want me to behave?

386
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,370
Grandmaster,

387
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,610
don't tease me.

388
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,050
Greetings, Grandmaster.

389
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,900
Niu San,

390
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,900
have you done the task I gave you?

391
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,530
Hurry and get to it.

392
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,020
I... I take my leave.

393
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,500
You truly carry such a presence as the new city lord.

394
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,290
It's all thanks to you, Grandmaster.

395
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,770
Don't worry.

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,940
I've told

397
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,330
those demonic cultivators

398
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,660
to take care of the Celestial Palace disciples in the city.

399
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,530
Once word spreads

400
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,370
that you claimed Winter City,

401
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,570
more Celestial Palace disciples will come

402
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,370
to join us.

403
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,530
When Tingyan hears of it,

404
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,940
she'll come here at once.

405
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,290
Winter City is still a small place.

406
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,810
If we want to see her at once,

407
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,090
we must seize a few larger cities quickly.

408
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,700
It seems the cold energy in your body hasn't recovered yet.

409
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,980
Father,

410
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,420
the process of restoring the cold constitution is painful.

411
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,700
Is there no other way?

412
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,940
To kill Sima Jiao,

413
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,020
you must use that cold energy to form Extreme Cold Ice Spikes.

414
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,740
Since you can't master this technique,

415
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,900
I can only cleanse your marrow

416
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,090
to awaken your cold constitution.

417
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,850
Father!

418
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,570
Yan,

419
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,370
I do this for your own good.

420
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,610
Don't blame me for being harsh.

421
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,700
We must kill Sima Jiao for revenge!

422
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,220
But Father, I don't hate him.

423
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,370
I can't share your hatred.

424
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,290
That's because you've lost your memories.

425
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,530
Why don't you restore them?

426
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,740
Eighteen years ago, I lost my son,

427
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,900
and you lost your brother.

428
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,420
I didn't restore your memories

429
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,940
because I didn't wish you

430
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,050
to relive the pain.

431
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,770
But since I've already forgotten,

432
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,420
and we get to live on,

433
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,330
we should cherish the days ahead all the more.

434
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,770
What is there to cherish

435
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,090
in such a ruined life?

436
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,370
Your brother died in the fire for your sake.

437
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,130
Do you mean to idle here

438
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,850
in comfort?

439
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,810
Please calm down, Father.

440
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,700
I dare not forget his sacrifice.

441
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,220
I have word

442
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,460
that Sima Jiao entered the Demon Realm a few days ago.

443
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,460
He'll soon deliver himself to us.

444
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,610
Focus on tempering your cold constitution.

445
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,020
Sima Jiao is coming.

446
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,740
But I haven't saved enough to go to Grain Rain Vale.

447
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,570
Is it wrong to simply live well?

448
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,570
You should only seek revenge if you have the strength.

449
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,090
Sima Jiao must be a grotesque monster.

450
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,660
I'm just too weak to fight him.

451
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,480
[Tomb of Beloved Mother, Zhou Qing'er]

452
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,050
Mother, I've come to see you.

453
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,020
[Bi'an]
I've taken a new name, Bi'an.

454
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,420
Those who seek

455
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,900
to exploit my Fengshan blood

456
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,290
won't be able to find me.

457
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,660
Mother, do you know?

458
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,770
They say Grandmaster has arrived in the Demon Realm.

459
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,180
Tomorrow,

460
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,500
I'll set out to find him and Ms. Yan.

461
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,090
Hopefully, the journey goes smoothly,

462
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,460
and they may be as kind as you said,

463
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,330
willing to accept me.

464
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,850
Mother, the Demon Realm is full of danger.

465
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,740
I can't linger here.

466
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,330
Once I find Ms. Yan and Grandmaster,

467
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,940
I'll return to see you.

468
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,430
[Rouge Terrace]

469
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,100
Come.

470
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,090
- Drink it. - Let me feed you, my lord.

471
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,170
Come, my lord.

472
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,980
Drink.

473
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,500
Come on, drink.

474
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,980
Come on, my lord.

475
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,020
- Nice one, my lord. - Drink.

476
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,170
- Come on. - One more cup.

477
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,570
Drink.

478
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,300
[You Chi, Demon Lord]

479
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,300
Why didn't you attend court again, my lord?

480
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,370
Attend for what?

481
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,650
To be nagged by those old men

482
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,650
for splurging on building another palace,

483
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,610
or scolded for not personally leading battles?

484
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,850
Besides,

485
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,610
Sima Jiao has already fused two Spirit Fires.

486
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,570
Why seek trouble for ourselves?

487
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,060
My lord,

488
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,460
I've found an ancient secret artifact, the Xingtian Chain.

489
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,370
If we catch that Frost Fish,

490
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,980
refine her into a froststone, and set her into the chain,

491
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,410
it'll be enough to kill Sima Jiao...

492
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,940
Just hearing about this Frost Fish makes me mad.

493
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,130
I've spent so much effort

494
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,170
and power

495
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,810
just to turn a Frost Fish with the extreme-cold nature

496
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,090
into human form?

497
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,980
And now?

498
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,090
Do you even know if she's dead or alive?

499
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,610
My lord...

500
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,460
Mingli.

501
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,170
You've served me for so long.

502
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,020
Don't you know me by now?

503
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,500
I have

504
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,780
neither the power of the former Demon Lord,

505
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,540
nor the ambition to restore the Demon Race.

506
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,260
I only wish

507
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,020
to live comfortably as a descendant of You,

508
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,940
and rot in the palace.

509
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,940
So please,

510
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,540
stop forcing me.

511
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,020
You Chi is such a fool!

512
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,890
Please calm down, Preceptor.

513
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,830
[Preceptor Residence, Demon Realm]

514
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,370
If the Demon Lord foils your plan,

515
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,350
[Mr. Ghost]

516
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,220
we might as well...

517
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,940
No.

518
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,010
When the former lord You Yan's soul returns,

519
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,700
we need You Chi's body as a vessel

520
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,660
to house his soul.

521
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,770
Nothing must happen to You Chi.

522
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,010
I was being inconsiderate.

523
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,940
Our top priority is finding Liao Tingyan.

524
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,900
Any news?

525
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,050
Our men

526
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,860
have been searching for those from the Celestial Palace.

527
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,660
Recently,

528
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,420
faint traces of the extreme-cold nature

529
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,420
were found in the southeast,

530
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,220
but it's too weak to confirm

531
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,530
if it belongs to the Frost Fish.

532
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,140
Isn't that near Celestial Crane City and Winter City?

533
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,620
Dispatch men immediately.

534
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,860
Better to follow a false lead than let her slip away.

535
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:31,860
Yes, Preceptor.

536
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,010
Grandmaster.

537
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,900
Grandmaster.

538
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,420
Grandmaster,

539
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,580
Winter City has ordered that no one from the Celestial Palace be mistreated.

540
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,140
This man tried

541
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,100
to abduct several of them.

542
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,580
I... I was only following orders.

543
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,170
Why are you taking people from the Celestial Palace?

544
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,730
We were ordered to seize them

545
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,690
and take them back to the Demon Palace.

546
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,970
That's all I know.

547
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,580
Where were you searching?

548
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,620
We split forces

549
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,140
between Winter City and Celestial Crane City.

550
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,660
Anyone from the Celestial Palace

551
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,930
could be Tingyan.

552
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,450
I can't allow her the slightest risk.

553
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,690
There was a fierce fight here.

554
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,340
Once I gather 2,000 demon stones,

555
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,180
I'll take that stubborn old man

556
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,530
to Grain Rain Vale to live out his days.

557
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,380
Who knows, he might give up forcing me.

558
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,010
Yes, gentlemen?

559
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,300
Charge!

560
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,300
Be careful.

561
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,490
Those from the Celestial Palace must be taken alive.

562
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,450
I'm afraid you won't get your wish today.

563
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,420
Watch out!

564
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,530
Go away!

565
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,340
You won't escape today.

566
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,650
Thank you, sir.

567
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,010
Follow me again, and I'll kill you.

568
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,170
Are you from the Celestial Palace?

569
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,570
May I ask about two people?

570
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,170
Do you know

571
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,920
where Lord of Mercy and his cultivation partner, Liao Tingyan,

572
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,800
are?

573
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,050
You're the Fengshan bloodline?

574
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,650
You're Grandmaster?

575
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,840
You really are!

576
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,320
I'm Zhou Yueqing,

577
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,570
Zhou Qing'er's daughter.

578
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,400
Ms. Yan and you saved me before.

579
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,880
Huan!

580
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,650
Why are you in the Demon Realm?

581
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,530
When the Celestial Palace fell into chaos,

582
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,320
my mother and I

583
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,280
fled here.

584
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,570
She passed away days ago.

585
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,880
I was left alone,

586
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,240
so I was looking for you and Ms. Yan.

587
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,760
I never dreamed I'd meet you here.

588
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,760
Please let me follow you.

589
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,440
I can do anything.

590
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,090
Mother said Ms. Yan loves to play.

591
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,360
I can keep her company

592
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,570
while you're busy.

593
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,050
She does indeed.

594
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,210
With this protection shield,

595
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,690
no one will recognize you

596
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,650
as a Fengshan descendant again.

597
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,840
Go to the Winter City Lord.

598
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,010
He will help you settle down.

599
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,530
Thank you, Grandmaster.

600
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,280
What about you?

601
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,840
Grandmaster,

602
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,800
we've claimed four cities.

603
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,760
Do we continue tomorrow?

604
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,970
Of course.

605
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,210
The Celestial Crane City is the hub of the southeast.

606
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,760
Understood.

607
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,970
Which means

608
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,650
many from the Celestial Palace

609
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,470
may be hiding there.

610
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,240
I'll give orders immediately.

611
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,970
We'll move out tomorrow.

612
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,360
In full force.

613
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,130
Absolutely.

614
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,360
But Grandmaster,

615
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,650
we've conquered

616
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,130
so many cities.

617
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,440
Why haven't we heard news about Tingyan?

618
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,360
Perhaps she got held up.

619
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,360
If she still doesn't appear,

620
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,130
I'll kick You Chi from his throne

621
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,880
and make the entire Demon Race search for her.

622
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,180
[Celestial Crane City]

623
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,570
Demon dragon?

624
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,280
The City Lord is a demon dragon!

625
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,800
That's incredible!

626
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,880
I knew I followed the right person.

627
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,610
I've long heard the fame of Winter City Lord and Lord of Mercy.

628
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,800
Since you rule the Demon Realm,

629
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,210
it has been peaceful and harmonious.

630
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,440
I, He Sou, City Lord of Celestial Crane City,

631
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,880
along with all demon soldiers, pledge loyalty to you both.

632
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,090
Open the gate.

633
00:40:51,070 --> 00:41:07,650
- Welcome! - Welcome!

634
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,130
Can't believe the leader has such a pretty face.
