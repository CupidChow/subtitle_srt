[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,420
[Episode 7]
[He'd only ever killed. The few he saved were for her]

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,650
Boss, where are we going?

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,940
To kill someone.

24
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,980
Can we not go?

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,010
What do you think?

26
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,550
Who's that?

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,940
Who's that?

28
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,090
That swagger beats even the Eight Palaces.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,450
- He may be some top disciple? - Ignore him.

30
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,970
Smells so good!

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,460
Eat whatever you want.

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,940
Then I won't hold back.

33
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,620
Boss, didn't you say we're going to kill someone?

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,340
Why bring me to a team dinner?

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,370
I mean just hanging out over food and drinks.

36
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,020
Weren't you hungry?

37
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,570
How did you know?

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,060
Your swallowing just now was too loud.

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,180
So he brought me here to eat

40
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,220
just because I was craving food?

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,780
Thanks, Boss.

42
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,340
Didn't know the Grandmaster could be thoughtful too.

43
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,740
Guess he's not as scary

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,810
as he looks.

45
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,850
Can you even afford that?

46
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,530
Please, calm down.

47
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,220
For you minor branches...

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,810
I think I heard my master's voice.

49
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,940
... being invited to Heaven Palace's flower banquet

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,460
is already a blessing.

51
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,770
Yet you still dare be so blind!

52
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,230
Insolent!

53
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,740
Serene Vale may be small and unknown,

54
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,410
but my master is still the head of a sect.

55
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,650
How dare you insult him!

56
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,620
- Bai Zhu... - Master!

57
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,060
It really is you!

58
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,650
Senior.

59
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,300
Tingyan!

60
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,060
What, calling for backup now?

61
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,690
Master, Junior, what's going on?

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,540
Senior, a Heaven Palace disciple got drunk,

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,100
bumped into our master,

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,130
spilled the Spirit Dew,

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,660
and accused Master of doing it!

66
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,740
Who's drunk?

67
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,740
It's just a jar of wine. I'll pay you.

68
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,940
How much?

69
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,740
The Spirit Dew's worth a hundred gems.

70
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,130
Well... I'll pay in installments.

71
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,690
Nonsense! You little brat!

72
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,690
Trying to mess with me?

73
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,100
You must have a death wish!

74
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,860
What's going on?

75
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,210
Who is that? Such high cultivation.

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,250
Boss! Grandmaster!

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,300
It really is Grandmaster!

78
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,810
I saw him when I followed Master

79
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,420
to greet the Lord of Mercy.

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,450
- Greetings, Grandmaster! - Greetings, Grandmaster!

81
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,770
Tingyan, bow now!

82
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,370
Seeing you out of the mountain safely

83
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,100
puts my mind at ease.

84
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,180
When I saw Grandmaster end so many lives,

85
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,100
I feared you'd...

86
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,370
Now the whole Gengchen Celestial Palace says

87
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,940
Grandmaster dotes on you.

88
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,330
Is that true?

89
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,540
No.

90
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,620
Grandmaster and I have no such romance.

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,740
Then why does he treat you so well,

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,370
even protect you in public?

93
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,660
Maybe I help him pass the time?

94
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,620
I only fear you're lazy,

95
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,060
slow-witted, and awkward.

96
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,540
Master, you really know how to insult someone.

97
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,770
What if you really anger Grandmaster

98
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,890
and he takes your life?

99
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,010
Better find a chance to resign

100
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,540
and return to Serene Vale to cultivate.

101
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,330
Grandmaster.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,620
Grandmaster.

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,740
You sent Liao Tingyan

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,740
to serve me,

105
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,660
yet you make decisions for me without asking?

106
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,770
Forgive me, Grandmaster. I wouldn't dare.

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,210
Grandmaster, my master didn't mean that.

108
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,300
Or do you want a reward?

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,980
I dare not accept.

110
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,250
Say it. What reward do you want?

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,060
I beg you, Grandmaster,

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,370
if Tingyan ever serves poorly,

113
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,250
please be lenient and spare her life!

114
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,740
Master...

115
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,450
Not allowed.

116
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,810
But I can grant you four spirit veins.

117
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,250
That many?

118
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,100
- Four spirit veins! - Yeah!

119
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,890
All at once?

120
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,500
Truly, when one rises, all rise with them.

121
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,100
This tiny Serene Vale

122
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,300
may soon catch up to our Moon Palace.

123
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,860
Thank you for the reward, Grandmaster!

124
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,330
More spirit veins don't always mean more power.

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,300
Take White Deer Cliff's spirit vein.

126
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,810
It's not a blessing for you.

127
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,860
Its spiritual energy is overwhelming.

128
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,690
What do you mean by that, Grandmaster?

129
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,660
For the Sima clan,

130
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,060
White Deer Cliff's vein is medicine.

131
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,690
For others, it's poison.

132
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,130
If outsiders cultivate with it,

133
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,810
the higher their realm, the greater the danger.

134
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,940
At the Unity Merge stage,

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,210
once you channel it,

136
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,260
you'll die instantly.

137
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,610
Master, don't worry.

138
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,330
- Grandmaster... - Farewell, Grandmaster!

139
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,260
So Sima Jiao really has feelings for Liao Tingyan.

140
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,490
Yet she neither tries to kill him

141
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,300
nor expose my identity.

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,780
What's her game?

143
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,540
Boss,

144
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,060
I can't cultivate,

145
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,020
but lately my body's changed.

146
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,900
Maybe it's from absorbing

147
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,450
White Deer Cliff's energy.

148
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,690
Will anything happen to me?

149
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,780
Probably.

150
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,090
Yes?

151
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,090
Then... will I die?

152
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,260
You're still far from Unity Merge.

153
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,450
That's good.

154
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,330
I have no talent for cultivation.

155
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,330
Guess being weak has its perks.

156
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,490
Let's go back.

157
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,060
Boss, didn't you say

158
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,140
we're going to kill someone?

159
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,610
Yeah, but you just ate so much.

160
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,020
If you puke at the sight of blood,

161
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,730
it'll ruin my mood.

162
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,420
Is he caring about me?

163
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,060
Like at the flower banquet,

164
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,210
he cared about me and even my folks.

165
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,020
I finally get it now.

166
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,260
The Grandmaster's all sharp tongue, soft heart.

167
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,260
He shouldn't be called Sima Jiao.

168
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,850
It should be Sima Sweetie!

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,180
Why are you laughing?

170
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,570
I was just thinking how considerate you are

171
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,540
to your subordinates.

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,730
My gratitude to you is like...

173
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,180
Shut up!

174
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,400
[Heaven Palace]

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,850
[Heaven Palace]
Sima Jiao claims that vein's like poison.

176
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,330
Master, what's your current realm?

177
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,850
I reached Unity Merge just yesterday.

178
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,420
Have you channeled it yet?

179
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,090
Thankfully, no.

180
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,060
Could it be

181
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,810
Sima Jiao is bluffing?

182
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,020
If he knew we took White Deer Cliff's vein

183
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,570
and cultivated in secret,

184
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,660
why wouldn't he just kill us?

185
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,850
When he came out, blood flowed everywhere.

186
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,570
He didn't hesitate.

187
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,730
Even the Sima clan's Bloodseal Bloom

188
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,380
must be taken with Fengshan blood.

189
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,810
So it's no surprise about White Deer Cliff's vein.

190
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,330
Then, Master,

191
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,420
what should we do now?

192
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,970
Lately, several high-level disciples

193
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,260
have entered Void Forge.

194
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,780
If this is true,

195
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,610
they may soon show reactions.

196
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,690
Should we warn them

197
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,020
not to use the vein for now?

198
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,420
No need.

199
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,330
Keep them calm. Don't spread it.

200
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,570
If Sima Jiao's right,

201
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,810
they can serve as my test subjects.

202
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,090
Grandmaster!

203
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,730
Grandmaster, what brings you here?

204
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,940
I'll go get the Master!

205
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:58,260
[Heaven Palace]

206
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,300
Master,

207
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,610
these past few days, several disciples in our palace

208
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,450
have gone mad during cultivation,

209
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,850
ending up mad and senseless.

210
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,060
All of them were among the most powerful in centuries,

211
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,660
already at the Void Forge stage.

212
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,450
Once at Void Forge, the next stage is Unity Merge.

213
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,970
Looks like Sima Jiao was right.

214
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,900
What should we do now?

215
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,060
I'm going to find Sect Master Shi!

216
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,450
Why be so formal?

217
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,420
Sect Master Shi, the Shi clan has served Grandmaster for generations.

218
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,610
I fear only you can save me now.

219
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,540
Master Tian, we're close friends.

220
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,060
Of course I'll help you!

221
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,690
Go back and wait for news.

222
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,380
I'll head to White Deer Cliff right away.

223
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,060
Thank you, sir!

224
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,210
Where's Tian Wuya?

225
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,970
He visited Shi Qianlv early this morning.

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,690
Tian Wuya really is Shi Qianlv's loyal dog.

227
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,850
That old fox will surely come beg for him.

228
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,970
So are we going to meet Shi Qianlv?

229
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,660
I have no interest in trading riddles

230
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,180
with that old man.

231
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,690
Let's go.

232
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,210
Let's bring Tingyan along.

233
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,450
She's a Demon Realm spy,

234
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,730
yet more upright than the Celestial Palace crowd.

235
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,900
She can't stand blood either, just gets in the way.

236
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,610
Grandmaster, actually...

237
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,690
I'm also scared of seeing corpses.

238
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,570
You've followed me for hundreds of years,

239
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,090
and you can't see through such a simple illusion?

240
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,060
Illusion?

241
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,610
So those Heaven Palace disciples

242
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,610
never truly went mad?

243
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,060
You created that scene

244
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,690
to frighten Tian Wuya?

245
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,300
Guards!

246
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,090
Anyone here?

247
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,730
Are you insane?

248
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,810
If you hadn't stolen White Deer Cliff's vein,

249
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,450
we wouldn't be in this mess!

250
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,260
How dare you slander and threaten me?

251
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,300
Grandmaster, spare my life!

252
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,380
Too late.

253
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,210
Sima Jiao, you've gone too far!

254
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,020
Trying to beat me with mortal techniques?

255
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,020
You stole my vein and cultivated with it.

256
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,490
Your realm now

257
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,690
must be close to mine.

258
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,420
If you channeled your power to fight back,

259
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,450
you may at least trade blows with me.

260
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,610
Why don't you?

261
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,090
Ah, you have a guilty conscience.

262
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,420
You are afraid the backlash will kill you.

263
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,570
What'll make you spare me?

264
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,180
Do it yourself.

265
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,770
If I'm satisfied, I'll spare you.

266
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,100
I was wrong.

267
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,660
Please spare me!

268
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,620
Satisfied now?

269
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,180
You really are soft on yourself.

270
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,250
Too bad...

271
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,010
White Deer Cliff's vein is fine.

272
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,100
Really?

273
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,340
One test will tell.

274
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,450
You'd rather waste your cultivation

275
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,690
than risk a real fight?

276
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,970
Then why should I keep you alive?

277
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,860
I'm fine?

278
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,490
Sima Jiao, you're playing me!

279
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,660
Let's add another restriction to this seal,

280
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,580
one that links to all his meridians.

281
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,730
That way, he can't kill himself

282
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,940
no matter the pain.

283
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,940
Do you still remember this?

284
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,620
You... you mean to...

285
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,620
Repay you in your own coin.

286
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,420
Grandmaster, I don't have Spirit Fire protection.

287
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,290
If I suffer this nail torture, I may die!

288
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,140
Just because I'm powerful,

289
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,450
I should endure five hundred years of this?

290
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,140
What did I do to deserve this?

291
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,980
♪Rewrite the starry tides of time♪

292
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,820
♪Dye the moon and sky in crimson light♪

293
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,220
♪We'll shatter destined paths♪

294
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,210
♪Through illusion's trials♪

295
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,670
♪Awaken silent souls to tremble♪

296
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,700
♪Transform our parting's elegy♪

297
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,790
♪Strength bows to nature's law alone♪

298
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,960
♪So what if we perish?♪

299
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,490
Tian Wuya is dead?

300
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,730
Sima Jiao,

301
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,450
you really don't take me seriously!

302
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,010
I waited at White Deer Cliff for half the day,

303
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,770
and he never showed.

304
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,860
He knew full well

305
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,530
I came to plead for Tian Wuya,

306
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,530
yet he killed him without a word!

307
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,730
Tian Wuya has always been on good terms with us.

308
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,210
Now we couldn't even protect his life.

309
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,970
If the other palace heads know this,

310
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,290
they'll doubt our ability to quell unrest.

311
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,290
They may not follow your orders in the future.

312
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,660
Sima Jiao's intent behind this incident

313
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,900
isn't that simple.

314
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,450
He's sending a warning.

315
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,450
Maybe...

316
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,860
he's sensed our plan?

317
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,860
If he really has,

318
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,450
not just our Shi clan,

319
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,100
the entire Gengchen Celestial Palace

320
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,290
will be destroyed by him!

321
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,940
I think

322
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,530
he still doesn't know.

323
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,250
Grandmaster, Shi Qianlv is summoning

324
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,660
the other palace heads.

325
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,900
Looks like he couldn't hold back after all.

326
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,940
But with Tian Wuya dead,

327
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,860
it's too soon

328
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,690
to install a new palace head.

329
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,210
Why's he gathering them now?

330
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,860
Either to seal me or kill me.

331
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,420
Same tricks as always.

332
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,380
If he tries to seal me,

333
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,450
then his cultivation must be terrifying.

334
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,140
If he tries to kill me...

335
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,770
How will he dare lay a hand on you?

336
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,380
The Gengchen Celestial Palace

337
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,250
now depends on your Spirit Fire.

338
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,900
If he kills you,

339
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,660
he can't cultivate anymore.

340
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,690
If he tries to kill me,

341
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,770
then his real motive gets interesting.

342
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,730
You've all heard

343
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,900
what happened with the Master Tian.

344
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,380
Grandmaster is far too ruthless.

345
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,690
He killed a palace head just like that.

346
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,420
I thought

347
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,290
he only killed enemies like Yin Liunian.

348
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,210
But now it seems

349
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,290
we've underestimated

350
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,140
his mad, violent nature.

351
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,290
Since he killed Tian Wuya,

352
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,660
that means

353
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,180
he still holds a grudge

354
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,010
over the last generation's seal.

355
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,380
Then we should strike first,

356
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,820
restart the sealing array and bind him.

357
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,290
Tian Wuya is dead.

358
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,860
Our new palace head still lacks influence.

359
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,380
Do the few of us have enough power?

360
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,860
Grandmaster's been cruel

361
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,530
and bloodthirsty since childhood.

362
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,730
I once thought to reform him,

363
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,690
but now it's clear

364
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,450
he's beyond saving.

365
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,450
Fine. If that's the case,

366
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,100
I'll lend my strength this time.

367
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,340
Good. With Sect Master Shi's help,

368
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,820
it's no difficult task.

369
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,690
Does everyone agree?

370
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,290
Madam Ye?

371
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,100
If Sima Jiao is sealed,

372
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,690
I'll have an even harder time killing him.

373
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,420
Master Yuan of the Four Seasons Palace,

374
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,140
you seem to have something to say?

375
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,770
I think we should think this over.

376
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,730
If we hastily activate the sealing array,

377
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,730
we'll both suffer heavy losses.

378
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,420
My disciples may all be wiped out.

379
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,340
Is that price worth it?

380
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,770
All of us have drunk Sima blood.

381
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,770
He won't let it go.

382
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,490
Tian Wuya is proof of that.

383
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,180
I have never drunk Sima blood.

384
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,530
But that doesn't mean

385
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,580
your ancestors never did.

386
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,730
You think Grandmaster will spare you?

387
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,420
How did Tian Wuya die?

388
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,530
Because he stole the spirit vein,

389
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,250
Grandmaster punished him.

390
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,620
If no one harbored ill intent,

391
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,620
he might not have bothered.

392
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,580
I understand now.

393
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,730
Master Yuan,

394
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,250
because that young disciple of yours

395
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,690
has caught Grandmaster's eye,

396
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,530
you're hesitating, right?

397
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,050
Ridiculous.

398
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,140
Grandmaster, just as you predicted.

399
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,420
Shi Qianlv gathered the other palace heads

400
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,490
to discuss sealing you.

401
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,010
Only Four Seasons Palace's master refused,

402
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,490
the rest agreed to his plan.

403
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,660
However...

404
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,340
Ruling hasn't taken a side.

405
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,660
Four Seasons Palace...

406
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,580
Forgive me, Grandmaster!

407
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,050
Well, that's new.

408
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,100
One smart one among the Eight Palaces.

409
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,770
By your earlier guess,

410
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,010
Shi Qianlv's cultivation is now high enough.

411
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,730
To replace Tian Wuya in the sealing ritual,

412
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,010
he'll need at least Unity Merge mastery.

413
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,770
Perhaps he's even achieved Grand Ascend.

414
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,050
So he's on par with you now?

415
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,180
He's not worthy to compare with me.

416
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,380
Shi Qianlv will likely exploit Yuan Che's weakness

417
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,290
for his own ends.

418
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,340
I never paid much attention to him before.

419
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,530
Find out what his soft spot is.

420
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,490
Understood.

421
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,580
Let's see who will win this round.

422
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,250
Father, Yuan Che is so stubborn.

423
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,900
He must be the type who fears death.

424
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,490
Looks like we'll need some leverage.

425
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,210
You underestimate him.

426
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,380
When Grandmaster came out, he vanished like a ghost,

427
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,420
extremely cautious.

428
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,380
Now that his disciple Liao Tingyan

429
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,250
has Sima Jiao's trust,

430
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,860
he'll be even less willing to offend him.

431
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,820
If we want him to turn,

432
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,010
we'll have to hit where it hurts.

433
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,290
Doesn't he have a son named Yuan Shang?

434
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,340
The damage to his spirit root

435
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,770
crushed all his ambition.

436
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,010
Yuan Che's worried himself sick over him.

437
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,380
Well, I'll find a chance to kill Yuan Shang

438
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,690
and blame it on Sima Jiao.

439
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,420
You want him dead?

440
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,900
Well, I won't say no.

441
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,580
Thanks. Just leave it there.

442
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,940
Let's see what great dishes we have today.

443
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,940
Such girly colors,

444
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,770
with a faint floral scent.

445
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,940
Could it be a love letter?

446
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,100
Small seal script. Luckily, I can read it.

447
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,380
"White Deer Cliff at midnight

448
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,290
by the Blue Lumina Blossoms, I'll be waiting."

449
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,660
No signature?

450
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,010
Who knows who wrote it.

451
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,530
Could it be Sima Jiao?

452
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,420
Coming to see me again tonight?

453
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,450
No way.

454
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,970
Pink perfumed paper?

455
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,620
That clueless tough guy?

456
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,580
Not a chance.

457
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,450
This tone...

458
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,940
Could it be this body's old lover?

459
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,050
No way. I can't show up.

460
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,730
Dealing with one unstable boss

461
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,140
is headache enough.

462
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,420
I don't need an ex on top of that.

463
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,900
It's already 3 a.m.

464
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,660
Liao Tingyan dares

465
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,180
to ignore me again and again!

466
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,530
Fine, don't blame me for what happens next!

467
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,620
Oh my...

468
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,490
Another attack?

469
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,100
It hurts... Help!

470
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,900
No one's there...

471
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,620
I have to find Grandmaster...

472
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,250
Or I'm done for...

473
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,690
Where's he?

474
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,900
Grandmaster...

475
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,580
This is Grandmaster's private space.

476
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,050
Back at Three Saints Mountain,

477
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,940
Mr. Snake snuck me in.

478
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,730
This time I came on my own...

479
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,380
Once is enough, not twice.

480
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,660
What if he gets angry?

481
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,770
It hurts so much...

482
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,100
Wake up.

483
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,490
Wake up!

484
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,620
My blood should've already suppressed the poison.

485
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,140
Maybe what's in her

486
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,860
isn't ordinary demonic poison?

487
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,010
Isn't she a Demon Realm spy?

488
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,820
Why does it keep backfiring on her?

489
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,250
Open your mouth.

490
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,290
Bite.

491
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,770
Bite!

492
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,770
Not too hard, not too soft.

493
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,050

[In Liao Tingyan's Soul Manor]

I haven't felt this relaxed in ages.

525
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,420
Did I sleep in the wrong place,

526
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,860
or did Boss grab the wrong pillow?

527
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,090
Why is it so noisy outside?

528
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,260
Feels like I suddenly gain super-vision

529
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,450
and super-hearing!

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,450

Grandmaster?

you ended up like this.

You drank my blood.

558
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,610
Of course it doesn't hurt.

559
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,170
I drank your blood?

560
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,170
Now's the time.

561
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,130
Let's kill her

562
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,650
and end the threat for good!

563
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,580
♪Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart...♪

564
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,450
Three Saints Mountain isn't a place for you to run wild.

565
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,700
Shouldn't wounds like this

566
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,820
heal instantly for cultivators?

567
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,090
But these wounds on his chest

568
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,700
haven't improved at all.

569
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,490
My body's different.

570
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,860
Wounds are hard to heal.

571
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,570
Why would you tell me such a weakness?

572
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,900
So what if you know that?

573
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,300
What can a little wound like this do to me?

574
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,650
At a time like this,

575
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,220
you're still putting on the "cool king" act?

576
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,130
What's a "cool king" act?

577
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,220
It's like you,

578
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,130
always going all out while coughing up blood.

579
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,340
You were worried when you saw me hurt.

580
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,940
Was I?

581
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,740
Oh right,

582
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,450
how did you detox me?

583
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,220
You drank quite a bit of my blood,

584
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,940
and ate a Bloodseal Bloom.

585
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,170
The one in legend?

586
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,340
Just one petal adds a thousand years of cultivation?

587
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,530
Too bad...

588
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,260
I passed out before I could even taste it.

589
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,450
Still, he's quite generous.

590
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,820
Your cultivation's now at Soulshift.

591
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,780
Well? Do you want to kill me?

592
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,450
No.

593
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,970
Want to gain more cultivation?

594
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,740
No.

595
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,970
Then do you want to leave me?

596
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,700
No!

597
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,570
Wait, no!

598
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,860
Why was that last answer also "no"?

599
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,260
Have I gotten so spoiled

600
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,940
by endless feasting and pleasure?

601
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,610
Well, he exhausted himself saving me.

602
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,340
How can I mind being his comfort?

603
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,260
Being an immortal feels so good.

604
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,450
Don't wander off.

605
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,780
Here in White Deer Cliff,

606
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,860
no one dares extend their spirit sense.

607
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,610
Once you leave,

608
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,380
you have no idea how many are watching,

609
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,220
like tigers eyeing prey.

610
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,650
With your current cultivation,

611
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,610
if you meet anyone out there,

612
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,650
you'll go mad instantly.

613
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,420
Spirit sense is what I felt just now?

614
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,380
Ever since I came to this world,

615
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,380
I've always felt

616
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,530
it wasn't real enough.

617
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,900
But after Sima Jiao's

618
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,050
"treatment" today,

619
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,970
with my cultivation soaring,

620
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,530
I finally feel like

621
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,900
I'm truly in the world of cultivation.

622
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,090
Turns out spellwork's this fun.

623
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,010
What else can I try?

624
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,380
Come.

625
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,050
You reached Soulshift just to be this weak?

626
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,130
One block and you failed it.

627
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,940
I just started learning spells!

628
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,610
Of course I can't compare

629
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,090
to your 500 years of nerd grind!

630
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,820
What is "nerd grind"?

631
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,090
Still, even with another five hundred years,

632
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,650
you still can't match me.

633
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,780
Some Grandmaster you are!

634
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,450
You're being so schoolkid!

635
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,530
Did I just say that out loud?

636
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,220
Since when am I this brave?

637
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,090
Are you insulting me?

638
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,610
No!

639
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,130
Where I'm from,

640
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,380
that's actually a compliment.

641
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,610
It means you're cute and lovable.

642
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,530
Always thinking about romance,

643
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,420
no wonder your people

644
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,300
never make any cultivation progress.

645
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,650
True.

646
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,340
I've now mastered the art

647
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,610
of sweet-talking Grandmaster.

648
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,780
Enough pretending. I can tell you want to eat it.

649
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,820
If you want it, eat your fill.

650
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,650
I can't be mad.

651
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,570
