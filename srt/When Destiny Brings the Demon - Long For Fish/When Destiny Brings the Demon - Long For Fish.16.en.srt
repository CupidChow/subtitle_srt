Now it's yours.

24
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,860
Wow.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,060
I'm touching a fish.
[*Chinese pun meaning slacking off]

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,290
You're so lazy.

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,180
You only like touching fish

28
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,320
when someone brings it to you.

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,850
This lake is known as Cloudsky Lake.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,810
And this is a Soul Flying Fish.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,410
It feeds on

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,370

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,690
That's precious.

35
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,370
Then I daren't touch it.

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,180
Let's release it.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,410
But I heard

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,340
the icy-blue fish are good for beauty.

39
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,620
Then I must touch it.

40
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,570
After you're done touching it,

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,460
we can

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,970
roast it and eat it.

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,090
Catching fish in someone else's lake

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,570
isn't good, is it?

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,220
But with you backing me up, it's fine.

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,410
Isn't just one fish a bit too few?

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,900
It's rare for me to cook.

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,370
I can't make just a humble spread.

49
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,250
Why is it only you who can catch those fish?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,450
This is true "touching fish".

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,060
Doing nothing at all?

52
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,570
I won't lift even a finger now.

53
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,250
Whoever can catch me lots of fish

54
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,060
is the best man ever in the world!

55
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,080
I'd love him! I'd admire him so much!

56
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,250
A man who can catch them is utterly handsome!

57
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,550
He makes me feel so safe.

58
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,740
Whoever can catch these fish must be exceptionally remarkable!

59
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,980
Enough chatter.

60
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,980
Good job.

61
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,370
Come. Let me wipe your sweat.

62
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,130
Such a trifle doesn't make me sweat.

63
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,740
Come on.

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,740
Crouch lower.

65
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,690
Don't roast all the fish.

66
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,660
Make me a soup, too.

67
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,060
You want to eat them?

68
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,770
I caught them myself.

69
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,620
Can't I eat them?

70
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,660
Of course you can.

71
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,130
What could make Grandmaster, who rarely eats,

72
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,450
suddenly demand food?

73
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,810
Is it the beauty fish,

74
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,300
or me, the slacking fish?

75
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,740
Too much noise.

76
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,810
This is divine cuisine.

77
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,060
No, it's a celestial delicacy.

78
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,740
How can fish taste so good?

79
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,330
Crispy outside, tender inside.

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,860
Fresh and fragrant.

81
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,420
How's the soup?

82
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,570
Taste it yourself.

83
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,940
It's so delicious, my tongue feels refreshed.

84
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,980
Nice.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,100
This should be taken to "Bite of Celestial Palace".
[*A famous Chinese food documentary]

86
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,060
To think Grandmaster, who rarely eats,

87
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,100
finds it tasty.

88
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,450
It's because the ingredients here are really good.

89
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,860
Such flavor with so little effort.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,250
I'm heading out tomorrow.

91
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,570
In your words,

92
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,970
I'm going to

93
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,180
"pursue my career".

94
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,810
This trip will take a few days.

95
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,660
If there's anything you want,

96
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,010
tell me anytime.

97
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,660
Don't worry.

98
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,330
I have the Transvision Mirror you gave me.

99
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,070
Pursue your career without worry.

100
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,130
Sima Jiao hides in the shadows, while we're out in the open.

101
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,500
Finding him won't be easy.

102
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,130
Sect Master Shi,

103
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,210
the fish in your treasured Cloudsky Lake

104
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,450
have been stolen by the dozens.

105
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,130
What?

106
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,370
Who did this?

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,570
This was left by the thief at the lakeside.

108
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,300
My...

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,860
There are traces of Tingyan's extreme-cold nature.

110
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,620
It seems

111
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,450
her cultivation has advanced further than before.

112
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,660
My fish!

113
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,210
My...

114
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,490
Gengchen Celestial Palace has grown more chaotic.

115
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,900
Sect Master Shi, you hardly ever catch

116
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,780
those Soul Flying Fish,

117
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,520
much less share them with us.

118
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,450
And now look.

119
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,620
They've been stolen by some nameless thief.

120
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,780
This is outrageous.

121
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,570
Who was it?

122
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,660
Sima Jiao?

123
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,970
Instead of focusing on his recovery,

124
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,080
you think he stole your fish right under your nose?

125
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,160
The Eight Palaces are all searching for him.

126
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,740
If it were him,

127
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,260
wouldn't that

128
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,290
be far too arrogant?

129
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,980
Exactly.

130
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,620
Soul Flying Fish

131
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,810
don't do much to aid recovery.

132
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,220
If Sima Jiao were in his right mind,

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,650
he'd never take the risk

134
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,100
of coming here to steal the fish.

135
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,530
But knowing his nature,

136
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,380
it's hard to say.

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,380
If Sima Jiao went to Cloudsky Lake

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,260
for Tingyan's sake,

139
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,930
then it makes sense.

140
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,690
Someone.

141
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,570
Young Madam.

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,620
Why hasn't anyone been sent in today?

143
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,810
Young Madam,

144
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,570
since the Grandmaster's incident,

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,860
all sects have tightened their defenses.

146
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,650
It's hard to find

147
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,930
suitable female disciples.

148
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,740
You know the art I'm practicing consumes my primordial spirit.

149
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,650
Why weren't you prepared earlier?

150
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,340
Please calm down, Young Madam.

151
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,170
Didn't you just enter Coreform recently?

152
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,890
It should be nourishing now.

153
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,460
Spare me, Young Madam.

154
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,260
Please spare me, Young Madam.

155
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,050
Chuhui!

156
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,140
Mother.

157
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,650
Chuhui,

158
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,410
where did you learn such evil arts?

159
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,620
Mother,

160
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,890
I went to great lengths to obtain this secret art.

161
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,020
Otherwise,

162
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,410
without the Grandmaster's reward,

163
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,570
how else

164
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,050
could I have advanced into Soulshift so quickly?

165
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,770
Young Madam,

166
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,690
you should know

167
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,170
shortcuts will harm you.

168
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,650
That's why I need disciples to replenish myself.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,170
Don't worry, Mother.

170
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,500
The ones I choose

171
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,810
are nobodies.

172
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,410
No one will notice

173
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,690
even if they die.

174
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,980
So how come I know about it now?

175
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,380
I've heard the rumors

176
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,650
that you're absorbing female disciples' cultivation.

177
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,050
It won't be long

178
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,650
before the other palace heads come after you.

179
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,690
I can't believe you, the daughter of a Palace Madam,

180
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,650
would actually practice such demonic arts.

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,930
How am I to face the others?

182
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,380
But Mother, you're the Palace Madam.

183
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,690
Even if they find out, why bother with them?

184
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,690
I can't stop halfway.

185
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,930
Madam,

186
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,500
why not send Young Madam to the Luo River Immortal District?

187
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,020
She can ease her mind there.

188
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,530
Also, the place is remote,

189
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,140
and it houses foreign sects.

190
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,980
Even if something happens, they won't dare make a scene here.

It's decided.

195

If calamity ever happens in the Inner Court,

196

you can avoid it.

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,020
Mother, what calamity could there be?

198
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,220

I've been feeling irritable for no reason lately.

My chest feels tight.

204
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,930
Why not go out shopping to relax?

Let's stroll the market.

We have enough gems.

We're not going back empty-handed today.

Miss, you truly care about your brother.

216
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,690
You even had an artifact custom-made for him.

217
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,980
I've always accepted his gifts without giving anything in return.

218
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,770

One moment, please.

235

Miss Yong, have a look at this silk brocade.

236
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,570
The design is no ordinary flower.

237
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,260
It's called Moonshade Bloom.

238
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,930
Special indeed.

239
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,290

Rarely seen by anyone.

244
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,140
Only we have this pattern.

245
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,410
The flower doesn't seem right,

246
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,260
but the fabric itself is lovely.

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,980
Have you seen Moonshade Bloom before, Miss Yong?

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,020

282
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,220

These are wounds from advanced spells.

They can't be healed by common spells.

00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,980
This is too cruel.

376
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,900
I need to bring Tingyan back for treatment.

377
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,500
But with Tingyan here,

378
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,370
it's the best chance to hunt down Sima Jiao.

379
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,850
Let's leave.

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,530
Are you sure that woman is Liao Tingyan?

381
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,570
Yes.

382
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,050
If you set an ambush in advance,

383
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,610
Sima Jiao is sure to be drawn here.

384
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,370
Send word to all palaces.

385
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,370
We set out at once.

386
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,220
We came as soon as we received the news.

387
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,260
Any news about Sima Jiao?

388
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,850
Fellow palace heads,

389
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,330
Sima Jiao is injured,

390
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,420
and his strength is greatly reduced.

391
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,570
Today, we must seize him without fail.

392
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,530
You're using my daughter as bait.

393
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,330
How can you guarantee her safety?

394
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,050
Madam Yue,

395
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,900
given Sima Jiao's current condition,

396
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,770
even if I can't defeat him,

397
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,260
I can at least fight him to a draw.

398
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,460
That will be enough for us to complete the sealing

399
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,090
and save your daughter.

400
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,700
Madam Yue, no risk, no glory.

401
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,850
Once this is done,

402
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,180
you'll be the leader of the Eight Palaces.

403
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,290
Then what are we waiting for?

404
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:40,850
I...

405
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,220
I mean, if we delay any longer, my daughter will be in danger.

406
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,610
Move out!

407
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,500
[True Virtue Speaks for Itself]

408
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,610
Tingyan.

409
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,290
Liao Tingyan is in danger.

410
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,740
The Eight Palaces are heading towards the suburbs of Mount Ziliu.

411
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,810
Grandmaster, let me go with you.

412
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,290
You haven't recovered yet.

413
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,420
I can at least support you.

414
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,530
This is likely a trap by Shi Qianlv.

415
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,180
Think twice.

416
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,610
Tingyan is my good friend.

417
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,940
You are my master.

418
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,900
If you go to save her,

419
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,500
I will follow without hesitation.

420
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,810
Why are you standing there?

421
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,940
The clothes are ready, Young Madam.

422
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,260
Please try them on.

423
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,260
What's the point of trying them?

424
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,020
But the clothes...

425
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,610
Your strength...

426
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,130
My cultivation has slowed down

427
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,460
without those disciples.

428
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,330
Where is the Soulshift girl

429
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,530
I brought back a few days ago?

430
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,900
She's still locked up.

431
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,290
Have Lord Han bring her to me.

432
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,570
Tingyan.

433
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,770
Tingyan.

434
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,220
Does it hurt, Tingyan?

435
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,660
It's fine.

436
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,940
You're lying.

437
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,370
I'm unwell.

438
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,900
It hurts me terribly.

439
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,940

Of course I am.

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,050
Yue Chuhui is the Young Madam of the Moon Palace.

469
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,900
You'll expose yourself.

470
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,900
Up ahead is Mount Ziliu Manor.

471
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,740

00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,610
Why make such a scene?

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,530
How dare you! Who allowed you in?

475
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,330
Lord Han, Lord of Wind.

476
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,050
I don't care who you are,

477
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,700
my guards will be here soon.

478
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,050

00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,460
none of you is getting away.

480
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,460
Grand... Grandmaster.

481
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,020
Liao Tingyan?

482
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,810
Grandmaster.

483
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,260
Don't come closer, Grandmaster.

484
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,180
My mother will rescue me soon!

485
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,740
There they are.

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,980
Chuhui.

487
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,420
Mother, save me!

488
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,980
Release my daughter, Sima Jiao!

489
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,740
Grandmaster, they're setting up the sealing array.

490
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,050
We're surrounded.

491
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,050
I know.

492
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,050
Be patient, Madam Yue.

493
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,500
Don't forget

494
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,330
our priority is sealing Sima Jiao.

495
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,900
You do it.

496
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,220
Strip her face,

497
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,700
and kill her.

498
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,180
No.

499
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,500
She bullied you

500
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,180
and hurt you.

501
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,900
You have to avenge yourself.

502
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,900
She scarred your face,

503
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,460
then you strip hers.

504
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,220
She had others beat you,

505
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,420
then you crush every single bone of her.

506
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,610
She made you suffer,

507
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,500
then you make her die in agony.

508
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,530
I was wrong, Grandmaster.

509
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,260
- Please spare me. - Kill her.

510
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,660
Sima Jiao, the Eight Palace Heads are all here.

511
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,220
If you release my daughter,

512
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,900
everything can be negotiated.

513
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,530
But if anything happens to her,

514
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,740
I'll take your life!

515
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,090
Noisy.

516
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,180
Uh...

517
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,500
Jiao, my stomach hurts.

518
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,740
It isn't serious.

519
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,090
Let's go back first.

520
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,660
- Yes? - No.

521
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,370
My inner injuries are serious.

522
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,900
If you don't heal me, I'll die.

523
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,500
I'm so afraid of pain.

524
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,940
Please, Grandmaster.

525
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,660
Are you sure you don't want to do it?

526
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,570
I'm not pretending.

527
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,850
Let's go back first.

528
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,900
All right?

529
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,700
Fine.

530
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,050
If you won't kill her,

531
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,180
I won't force you.

532
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,220
It looks like the Eight Palaces are hunting us down,

533
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,260
and you're still wounded.

534
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,330
Let's negotiate with them with Yue Chuhui

535
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,740
and retreat first.

536
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,290
I'll do anything you ask.

537
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,770
But this person

538
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,940
must pay the price.

539
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,980
No, Grandmaster.

540
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,740
Please don't.

541
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:53,810
No.

542
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,770
Chuhui!

543
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,460
Hold yourself together, Madam Yue.

544
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,290
Didn't you say you could save her,

545
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,180
did you?

546
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,130
I should've rushed in long ago,

547
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,370
not wasted time here with you.

548
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,900
What use is it if you rush in alone?

549
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,290
Do you stand a chance?

550
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,740
Your daughter only lost her cultivation.

551
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,330
At least her life is spared.

552
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,500
Don't lose focus, Madam Yue.

553
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,810
Hold yourself together.

554
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,850
I must kill you two

555
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,290
to atone for my daughter.

556
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,770
You think your array can hold me long?

557
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,810
Sima Jiao, if you could break it,

558
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,130
you'd have done so already.

559
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,770
After the battle at Baifeng Mountain,

560
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,900
you were gravely injured and haven't recovered yet.

561
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,260
Am I right?

562
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,370
Whether or not I have recovered,

563
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,020
you can come here

564
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,050
and try me.

565
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,090
Stop it, Ruling.

566
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,180
Ruling, if you persist,

567
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,260
how can we still be friends?

568
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,180
From the moment I swore to kill Sima Jiao,

569
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,050
I knew this day would come.

570
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,810
Are all the days we shared

571
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,090
going to end here?

572
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:03,980
Yes.

573
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,730
Liao Tingyan, Hei Nianjiu,

574
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,420
the next time we meet,

575
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,020
I won't hold back.

576
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,980
Sima Jiao.

577
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,020
I knew you hadn't healed yet.

578
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,090
The Spirit Fire is truly robust.

579
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,380
Even gravely injured,

580
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,460
you can still fight me this long.

581
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,340
The array is nearly complete.

582
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,610
Sima Jiao, your number is up.

583
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,860
Sima Jiao.

584
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,500
Sima Jiao.

585
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,090
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

586
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,860
How could this be?

587
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,500
Could someone within the Eight Palaces have helped him?

588
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,460
Chuhui.

589
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,820
Chuhui!

590
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,380
Madam Ye.

591
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,210
I saw you speaking

592
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,780
with those flying kites just now.

593
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,500
What were you talking about?

594
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,610
They tried to convince me to go easy on Sima Jiao,

595
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,250
but I refused.

596
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,050
Are you suspecting me, Sect Master Shi?

597
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,420
You and Liao Tingyan

598
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,980
are close friends.

599
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,020
And you're also tight with that black serpent.

600
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,340
You can't blame me for being suspicious, Madam Ye.

601
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,130
You're overthinking it, Sect Master Shi.

602
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,730
Come, sit down.

603
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,050
How do you feel now?

604
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,860
I'm fine. It's just a small wound.

605
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,020
Your injuries haven't healed yet.

606
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,530
How did you break the seal?

607
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,530
Back in the array,

608
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,340
you told me

609
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,090
you needed help from one of the Eight Palaces,

610
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,020
so you sent me to persuade Ruling,

611
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,420
right?

612
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,610
Ye Ruling was just a pretense.

613
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,130
The one who helped was Yuan Che.

614
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,050
What if he betrayed you,

615
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,730
or couldn't help at all?

616
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,170
Wouldn't that even have been more dangerous?

617
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,900
When it comes to saving you, there's no such thing as "what if".

618
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,050
You knew it was a deadly trap,

619
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,690
and you couldn't defeat them,

620
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,130
but you still risked it for me.

621
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,020
Who says I couldn't defeat them?

622
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,340
Yes, you could.

623
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,130
I didn't expect you'd learn how to work with others.

624
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,020
It's his honor across three lifetimes to aid me.

625
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,900
There's no such thing as collaboration.

626
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,730
You should learn to ask others for help more often.

627
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,500
Since you already had Yuan Che

628
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,460
as your backup,

629
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,940
why send me to persuade Ruling

630
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,420
and release those flying kites for all to see?

631
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,020
To not arouse Shi Qianlv's suspicion,

632
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,900
I needed someone convincing

633
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,090
to mislead him.

634
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,170
So Ruling was just Yuan Che's decoy?

635
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,820
But she's my friend.

636
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,690
I forgot.

637
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,250
She and I aren't friends anymore.

638
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,460
Losing a false friend

639
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,050
is nothing worth brooding over.

640
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,420
You don't make friends,

641
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,210
so you wouldn't understand.

642
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,860
You're taking it out on me.

643
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,980
I'm sorry. I've just been so irritable lately

644
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,250
for no reason.

645
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,460
It gets worse when I think of Ruling.

646
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,460
I feel so stifled,

647
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,050
as if something's pressing on my chest.

648
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,130
You've been feeling like this lately?

649
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,090
I don't know why.

650
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,650
This frustration just came out of nowhere.

651
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,090
Let's heal your wounds first

652
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,020
before dealing with your troubles.

653
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,250
Stop it, Ruling.

654
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,570
Ruling, if you persist,

655
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,130
how can we still be friends?

656
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,730
Are you alone too?

657
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,170
Are you also a slacker,

658
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,530
just like me?

659
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,130
You never looked down on me?

660
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,460
I admire you so much.

661
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,300
We're good friends from now on.

662
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,500
Yes.

663
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,730
Are all the days we shared

664
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,340
going to end here?

665
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,250
Yes.

666
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,020
Your eyes are sparkling.

667
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,690
So beautiful.

668
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,050
I was a serpent before.

669
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,940
You gave me the chance to become human.

670
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,250
You gave me life.

671
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,300
If you want to take it back,

672
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,690
go ahead.

673
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,570
Master,

674
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,130
this is my gift as your disciple.

675
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,690
If I call for you with this...

676
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,130
If you need me,

677
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,730
I'll appear by your side anytime.

678
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,980
Hurry.

679
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,210
Get moving.

680
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,690
Why are you lying down? Get up.

681
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,420
Hey, move faster.

682
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,860
Now, the Sima Clan has only Sima Jiao left.

683
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,860
Once he's dead,

684
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,820
we can return to our homeland.

685
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,250
Tingyan, Nanjiu, forgive me.

686
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,210
I've failed you.

687
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,730
I don't live for myself alone.

688
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,570
I must bring my people home.

689
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,860
I'm sorry for letting you down.
