00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,650
Three Saints Mountain isn't a place for you to act recklessly.

190
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,290
- Spare us, Grandmaster! - Spare us, Grandmaster!

191
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,140
Spare us, Grandmaster!

192
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,170
I was finally having some fun,

193
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,260
and you ruined it.

194
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,220
Why did you kill her?

195
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,020
She only joined Four Seasons Palace recently,

196
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,570
and her cultivation is low.

197
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,810
While I...

198
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,530
I'm here to serve you.

199
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,260
How could I let someone like that

200
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,220
remain by your side?

201
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,020
Speak up.

202
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,020
Why are you here?

203
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,460
I came to be your concubine.

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,930
I want a child

205
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,050
with the Sima clan's atavistic bloodline.

206
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,570
Once the Fengshan Clan

207
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,530
has an heir,

208
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,410
we'll trap and kill you, take the Spirit Fire,

209
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,650
and rid Gengchen Celestial Palace of a great threat.

210
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,020
Then our Star Palace

211
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,860
will rule Gengchen Celestial Palace.

212
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,170
And I...

213
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,740
will be the next Palace Mistress.

214
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,740
And you? What are you here for?

215
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,260
I hate Yun Xiyue.

216
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,690
I came to steal her chance.

217
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,690
After all these years,

218
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,340
you're still playing the same tired tricks.

219
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,980
Atavistic bloodline

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,980
might not appear once in a thousand years.

221
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,290
If I die,

222
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,690
Gengchen Celestial Palace is finished.

223
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,100
Forget your palace heads and lineage heads.

224
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,810
You'll all die with me!

225
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,100
Understood?

226
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,690
Grandmaster, I...

227
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,650
Now,

228
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,170
just one last step.

229
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,290
Looks like I'll have to take the time

230
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,420
to teach her how to kill.

231
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,220
Tingyan!

232
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,370
Grandmaster.

233
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,940
What happened to her?

234
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,740
Xiyue and Wanqing are dead!

235
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,700
They didn't even leave a trace of their spirit.

236
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,610
How could he strike so viciously?

237
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,530
Is he truly without principle?

238
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,020
What principle can he have?

239
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,900
The disciples we send keep dying.

240
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,500
If he weren't trapped in Three Saints Mountain,

241
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,980
I fear he'd have wiped out

242
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,330
our entire Celestial Palace by now.

243
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,220
Another light's gone out.

244
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,260
It's someone from the Yin Palace!

245
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,500
Master.

246
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,220
I sacrificed my life to send my soul out

247
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,220
and bring you this message.

248
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,460
What news is so important?

249
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,530
Today we secretly slipped

250
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,900
into the Grandmaster's Central Tower.

251
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,570
The night of the new moon is coming.

252
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,850
I've been locked here for 500 years,

253
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,850
power suppressed, tortured daily.

254
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,530
And that night

255
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,090
will be when I'm weakest.

256
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,570
You must guard me well,

257
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,610
or else...

258
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,570
my life will be in danger.

259
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,570
The night of the new moon

260
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,180
is his only weakness in 500 years.

261
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,850
The Grandmaster is now the only one

262
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,050
who can sustain the Fengshan Spirit Fire.

263
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,610
If someone uses this chance

264
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,530
to harm him,

265
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,180
what then?

266
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,260
We all know how powerful he is.

267
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,180
When he was just a boy,

268
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,610
our elders spent everything they had

269
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,570
and gathered all Eight Palaces' bloodlines to seal him.

270
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,610
Master Di, Master Yang, and Master Yin,

271
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,090
you took part as well.

272
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,850
You know it best!

273
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,700
Will a single night of the new moon

274
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,610
truly weaken him that much?

275
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,050
We'll see if the spirit vein weakens

276
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,370
on the night itself.

277
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,500
If he's truly weak,

278
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,260
the entire Celestial Palace's spirit vein

279
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,900
will naturally weaken too.

280
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,180
The sealing nails in him keep him

281
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,570
from taking his own life.

282
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,330
That part

283
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,770
can't be faked.

284
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,050
Everyone,

285
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,810
this concerns the Grandmaster and the entire Celestial Palace.

286
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,290
Tomorrow night is the new moon.

287
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,740
If the spirit vein shifts,

288
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,130
we must guard him at once.

289
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,180
Tingyan, you're awake.

290
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,180
Ruling...

291
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,500
When I got there, you were already out cold.

292
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,180
I don't know what happened.

293
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,130
But I smelled blood everywhere.

294
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,290
Maybe some disciple angered him

295
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,940
and got killed.

296
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,810
Sima Jiao

297
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,940
can be a bit odd at times,

298
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,180
but from what I've seen,

299
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,020
he's not a bloodthirsty man.

300
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,380
I remember now. Before I fainted,

301
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,370
Yun Xiyue and Hua Wanqing were coming after me.

302
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,850
I was even hurt.

303
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,900
But I just checked,

304
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,940
and there's no trace of injury.

305
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,260
Could Sima Jiao have saved me?

306
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,180
The Grandmaster would save someone?

307
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,420
Could he...

308
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,460
Could the Grandmaster

309
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,050
really have feelings for you?

310
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,700
Impossible.

311
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,020
It's definitely because I'm his walking air conditioner.

312
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,370
I mean I can cool him down,

313
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,660
ease the Spirit Fire's burning.

314
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,570
The Spirit Fire isn't ordinary,

315
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,530
and Tingyan's body can cool Sima Jiao.

316
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,810
Could she have

317
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,770
the extreme-cold nature from the Demon Realm?

318
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,900
So that's it.

319
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,340
Oh, besides,

320
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,810
thanks to Black Serpent

321
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,220
for tipping me off,

322
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,500
I made it in time today.

323
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,020
Speaking of Mr. Snake, he's actually quite nice.

324
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,610
Last time was just a misunderstanding.

325
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,220
Ruling, can you return his heart?

326
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,740
Luckily, Tingyan's fine.

327
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,180
I owe Black Serpent my thanks.

328
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,010
Mr. Snake, have you been well lately?

329
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,500
No, "been well" doesn't sound right here.

330
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,740
I was too reckless before.

331
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,420
I thought you'd swallowed my friend Tingyan,

332
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,220
and that's why I misunderstood you.

333
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,700
Today I'm here to apologize.

334
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,900
I heard you like this drink,

335
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,500
so I brought it.

336
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,740
You want this, right?

337
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,850
What happened to you...

338
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,090
Mr. Snake...

339
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,220
What... what did you do to me?

340
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,610
When I received this...

341
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,900
When I got this heart of yours,

342
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,090
I always kept it with me,

343
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,660
never touched it.

344
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,460
I turned into human form!

345
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,850
Ruling, it's all thanks to you!

346
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,980
Ruling...

347
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,460
Look, I've waited so long for this day!

348
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,700
Really, thank you, Ruling.

349
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,260
Though I don't know

350
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,260
what method you used,

351
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,500
today I became human.

352
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,180
Thank you.

353
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,130
Ruling, thank you

354
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,660
for giving me a chance to be human.

355
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,370
Tomorrow night is the new moon.

356
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,740
This is my chance.

357
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,500
I can't miss it.

358
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,290
Grandmaster!

359
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,180
It's me.

360
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,850
I've taken human form.

361
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,740
It happened

362
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,090
after Ye Ruling returned my heart.

363
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,740
I don't know what she did,

364
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,530
but I could take human form.

365
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,770
After all the blood you drank from me,

366
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,330
you could've turned long ago.

367
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,940
Yes, that's how it should be.

368
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,290
Back then,

369
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,610
you fed me with your own flesh and blood,

370
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,130
so I could claw my way back to life.

371
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,020
Grandmaster, my life is yours.

372
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,700
I'll follow you to the death!

373
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,530
Since you're human now,

374
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,220
you should learn to live like one.

375
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,570
Tingyan said the same.

376
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,770
She told me not to lick her fingers.

377
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,460
She also told me

378
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,980
to learn self-respect and self-love like a person.

379
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,090
But Grandmaster,

380
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,020
I don't know how to be human.

381
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,980
You went to see her first?

382
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,770
Without Tingyan,

383
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,500
Ruling wouldn't have returned my heart.

384
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,660
I went to thank Tingyan!

385
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,910
Grandmaster, Tingyan's a true friend.

386
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,570
A true friend?

387
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,020
She's really good at winning people over.

388
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,500
Tomorrow night, guard the mountain gate.

389
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,530
Yes, Grandmaster.

390
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,810
Aunt-Master, do you wait here every day?

391
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,850
Why do you want to see the Grandmaster so badly?

392
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,220
He sustains the Spirit Fire alone,

393
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,530
letting all of Gengchen Celestial Palace

394
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,740
enjoy endless spiritual power.

395
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,090
Gaining his favor has been my dream since childhood,

396
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,020
and the pride of our Heaven Palace.

397
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,290
But he's unpredictable.

398
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,420
Aren't you afraid he'll kill you?

399
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,130
Even if he does,

400
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,020
I'll have no regrets.

401
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,900
Are all cultivators

402
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,770
this ready to die?

403
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,460
I can't do that.

404
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,050
Being alive is great.

405
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,260
Why die for someone else?

406
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,290
If there's a chance to live,

407
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,330
I'll fight for it no matter what.

408
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,020
Boss,

409
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,420
don't scare me so early in the morning.

410
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,130
How can you be so timid?

411
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,500
So you'd better

412
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,260
not pile too much work on me,

413
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,180
or if I get hurt, you'll be responsible.

414
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,050
Such a hassle.

415
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,810
Want me to take responsibility for you?

416
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,810
You've got some ambition.

417
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,610
Grandmaster, you sure know what to focus on.

418
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,570
What kind of spell is this?

419
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,530
You used this trick

420
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,460
to win over that dumb snake?

421
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,290
Wronged! I can't use spells.

422
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,090
You know that.

423
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,500
Then tell me, what is this spell?

424
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,500
It's a thumbs-up gesture.

425
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,530
What's a thumbs-up?

426
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,850
It's kissing up to you,

427
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,290
buttering you up, and flattering you.

428
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,700
Such petty tricks

429
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,570
are utterly beneath me.

430
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,090
Yet you seemed to enjoy it.

431
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,090
Too bad, I don't want kisses,

432
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,460
and I don't eat butter.

433
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,740
Your little scheme has failed.

434
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,170
I...

435
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,850
Stop right there.

436
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,050
How's your practice with the spell

437
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,980
I taught you last time?

438
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,050
So-so, I guess.

439
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,700
Grandmaster, what are you doing?

440
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,130
Remember, when you kill someone,

441
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,370
it's best to stab here.

442
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,940
Or at least,

443
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,180
stabbing here works too.

444
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,770
Learned it?

445
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,260
Yes. Thank you for the lesson.

446
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,920
Well then...

447
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,700
I'll go water the little flame now.

448
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,850
Everyone, please stay calm.

449
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,810
Don't disturb the Grandmaster.

450
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,740
We agreed to wait and see about the spirit vein.

451
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,330
Yet some came early,

452
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,330
hoping to strike while he's weak.

453
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,900
Master Tian, you really can't stand evil.

454
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,460
So what are you here for?

455
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,610
Naturally, to protect the Grandmaster.

456
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,180
Protect him?

457
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,570
That's the official line, but in truth,

458
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,250
who here isn't eyeing him?

459
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,940
Some want to snatch the Bloodseal Bloom

460
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,250
while he's weak.

461
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,020
Others want to take credit

462
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,050
and win his favor.

463
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,860
That's the best-case scenario.

464
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,730
The worst is those who fear he'll settle old scores

465
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,730
and try to strike first to kill him.

466
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,650
Madam Yue!

467
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,900
Don't sling mud!

468
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,610
We all rely on him to cultivate.

469
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,900
Who'd want to harm him?

470
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,460
Who knows?

471
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,020
There are always a few

472
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,250
who don't care about the big picture.

473
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,610
Hey!

474
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,820
Please,

475
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,610
calm yourselves.

476
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,460
Whatever the case,

477
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,730
we all want the Grandmaster safe

478
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,820
to keep the spirit vein alive.

479
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,460
I'm here

480
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,780
not to stand in anyone's way.

481
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,650
Just asking you to know your limits.

482
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,780
Please, go ahead.

483
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,730
I still think something's off.

484
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,860
What if Anxue's message is fake,

485
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,090
and the Grandmaster lures us in to kill us?

486
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,050
No risk, no reward.

487
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,610
With a gut that small, how will you get the Bloodseal Bloom?

488
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,940
Madam Xing's concern isn't unfounded.

489
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,380
I propose,

490
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,570
since it was my palace's Anxue

491
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,530
who sent the news,

492
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,300
this matter should be handled by my palace.

493
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,570
I'll send elders inside to guard the Grandmaster.

494
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,860
How about it?

495
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,650
You're just trying to rush in

496
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,730
and take all the Bloodseal Blooms, right?

497
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,500
Then I'll leave it to you, Master Yin.

498
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,210
So that's how Bloodseal Blooms grow.

499
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,730
Did you eat the petals I gave you?

500
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,240
No.

501
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,530
The Bloodseal Bloom only works with my blood.

502
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,860
Otherwise, it'll blow you into a mist of blood.

503
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,020
You've drunk my blood, so don't worry.

504
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,340
It's too precious. I can't bear to use it.

505
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,170
Why not eat it?

506
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,570
A cup of coffee

507
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,420
only gives you an extra hour of energy.

508
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,460
But one petal gives a thousand years of cultivation.

509
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,570
I'm afraid it might kill me.

510
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,530
What if I insist you eat it?

511
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,500
Then I still won't.

512
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,530
I'll take a gamble.

513
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,050
See if you'll kill me for it.

514
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,860
How could I even say things like that out loud?

515
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,420
Fine, have it your way.

516
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,170
What's with you today, Grandmaster?

517
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,460
You think I'm easy to deal with today?

518
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,250
Guess why.

519
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,730
Because...

520
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,780
I'm going to be killed?

521
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,280
The one getting killed

522
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,900
isn't you.

523
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,050
You think you can kill me?

524
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,610
All together, kill him!

525
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,530
How can this be?

526
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,420
The new moon hasn't affected you

527
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,380
or weakened you at all!

528
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,780
Boss, you're really okay?

529
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,530
If I get hurt,

530
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,570
will you want to kill me like they do?

531
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,090
You're wrong.

532
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,170
I am badly hurt.

533
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,780
Today really is my weakest day.

534
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,500
If you want to kill me,

535
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,610
this is indeed a golden chance.

536
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,500
However...

537
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,820
Even in this state,

538
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,980
to me,

539
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,940
you are still too weak.

540
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,420
Boss,

541
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,650
you've got blood on your lips

542
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,460
when you say those cool lines.

543
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,050
Liao Tingyan.

544
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,860
I'm badly hurt right now.

545
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,130
This is a good chance for you.

546
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,210
Got it!

547
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,420
It's a perfect chance to suck up to you.

548
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,380
Boss, satisfied now?

549
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,210
That lady...

550
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,250
Sima Jiao can't fight back anymore.

551
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,380
Take the sword and kill him!

552
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,980
I don't kill.

553
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,500
If he lives, you die!

554
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,690
And more will die later!

555
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,340
Hurry, do it!

556
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,380
He's right.

557
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,380
Go ahead.

558
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,460
Pull the sword out.

559
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,090
