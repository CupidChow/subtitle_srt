[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,460
[Episode 28]
[Will It Only Be Happiness From Here On?]

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,500
Then why don't we start with a celebration?

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,290
It would lift everyone's spirits.

24
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,370
What is there to celebrate?

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,650
How about a marriage between an immortal

26
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,290
and a demon?

27
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,700
Are you

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,370
proposing to me?

29
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,180
If you think of it that way,

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,620
I cannot deny it.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,180
How dare you tease me?

32
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,940
Then, when shall we marry?

33
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,850
Since you have asked,

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,810
the sooner the better.

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,620
It need not be so soon.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,530
I'm not in such a hurry.

37
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,180
Is that so?

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,650
The Demon Mistress can wait.

39
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,650
The Immortal Lord can't.

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,910
I'll take you over there.

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,800
They have candied hawthorns.

42
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,360
Come and take a look.

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,020
It seems the uniting of immortals and demons in Yan City has borne fruit.

44
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,300
If only every place in the world could be this harmonious,

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,300
how wonderful it would be.

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,500
You sounded like a ruler of the Demon Realm.

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,370
Chestnut steamed cake.

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,970
Crystal Fish Slices!

49
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,130
Peony meatballs.

50
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,940
Crispy honeyed fruit.

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,060
How did you know this is what I have been craving?

52
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,900
Does this not surpass

53
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,130
the food street you are so familiar with?

54
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,740
It totally does.

55
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,410
I can stay home

56
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,020
and still taste the finest delicacies.

57
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,410
It's as if you live in my mind like a parasite.

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,300
How bold.

59
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,300
Did you call me a parasite?

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,650
Yan.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,890
It has been a while.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,660
Jiao.

63
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,450
Why have you come?

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,010
Yan's inner core can't merge with the demon core.

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,770
If it continues, she is going to die.

66
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,770
I can help her.

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,740
How can you help her?

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,180
Our Chang family has a secret technique for merging cores.

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,330
Perhaps I can try that.

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,570
Where is Mingli?

71
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,980
The last time I saw him was in

72
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,690
the forests of the Demon Realm.

73
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,500
He may have already fled by now.

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,540
Why does your Spirit Fire mark look so strange?

75
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,860
Weren't your wounds already healed?

76
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,100
It's nothing.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,300
I only need some rest.

78
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,620
It was the same before.

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,130
You don't need to worry.

80
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,370
What matters most right now is your inner core.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,860
You shouldn't be too anxious.

82
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,300
Feng Qi said

83
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,100
there's still hope.

84
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,450
Feng Qi,

85
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,300
are you really willing to save me?

86
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,330
Yan,

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,420
I lured you to the White Bone Abyss.

88
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,890
I abused your trust.

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,330
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,060
But this time, I want to make amends.

91
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,450
Please give me a chance.

92
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,860
Jiao.

93
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,690
Why not give Feng Qi another chance?

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,660
He has a good nature.

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,690
He was only being used.

96
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,890
Besides,

97
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,250
the only one who knew the Soul Cleanse,

98
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,060
Shi Qianlv, is dead.

99
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,250
With your Truth Spell,

100
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,450
he can't lie.

101
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,810
Feng Qi.

102
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,570
I'll entrust the matter of merging the cores to you.

103
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,420
I'll give it my all.

104
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,540
Well?

105
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,770
No discomfort.

106
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,010
It's only stabilized for now.

107
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,210
The Demon Lord's inner core is too powerful.

108
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,300
To merge it completely

109
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,740
will take some time.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,010
I'll brew you some medicine

111
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,330
to strengthen you.

112
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,180
Shouldn't you check the cores?

113
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,300
The two cores have already started to merge.

114
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,940
It seems we misunderstood Feng Qi.

115
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,740
It's best if he has come around.

116
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,740
I can't help but feel

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,010
the lead is too good to be true.

118
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,330
You're overthinking.

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,690
From this day forward,

120
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,860
only good days await us.

121
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,740
I never realized before

122
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,130
that our Celestial Palace had such good wine.

123
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,570
And why should this wine be said to come from the Celestial Palace?

124
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,020
The Demon Realm also has such fine wine.

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,810
How laughable.

126
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,490
All the spirit food on today's banquet table

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,540
was gathered by our Grandmaster.

128
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,940
Even this wine is brimming with spiritual energy.

129
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,730
How could the Demon Realm possess it?

130
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,090
What the Demon Realm has

131
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,180
is nothing but sorcery

132
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,810
and poisonous miasma.

133
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,660
Say that again if you dare.

134
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,780
You dare

135
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,180
assault a general!

136
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,780
Stand down!

137
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,210
This banquet in Yan City was held

138
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,210
to celebrate peace between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

139
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,540
And yet you behave in this manner.

140
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,570
Do you mean to go against the command of the Grandmaster

141
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,090
and the Demon Mistress?

142
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,260
Enough.

143
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,020
It's getting late.

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,140
Go home now.

145
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,060
Don't cause any more trouble.

146
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,380
Yes.

147
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,260
You heard the General.

148
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,940
Let's go!

149
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,940
Yes.

150
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,180
Rest assured, General.

151
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,380
We'll find a way

152
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,970
to have payback!

153
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,730
Right.

154
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,690
The Gengchen Celestial Palace is nothing!

155
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,970
Nothing but hypocrites with flowery words.

156
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,810
Enough.

157
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,660
I was too rash.

158
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,490
Our Demon Mistress must keep the land safe.

159
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,660
Let her enjoy some peaceful days.

160
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,260
If you want to hold your head high before those of the Celestial Palace,

161
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,690
then lead your people under your care

162
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,810
and show them some worth.

163
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,140
Let's go.

164
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,490
Yes.

165
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,940
This wound

166
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,900
was indeed the cause of Commander Niu San's death.

167
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,690
Yes.

168
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,970
It came from General Chi's technique.

169
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,450
Chi Anhe,

170
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,420
I knew it.

171
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,450
You killed our commander while he was drunk.

172
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,810
Despicable! Shameless! Vile!

173
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,540
You'll pay for this!

174
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,850
That is utter slander.

175
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,780
If I, Chi Anhe, wanted to kill someone,

176
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,380
I'd do it righteously and make it clean.

177
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,850
Why would I hide it?

178
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,060
Stop denying your crime!

179
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,140
Hongluo, Nianjiu!

180
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,490
This is the resentment they left behind.

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,380
It seems only I see it.

182
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,810
Bah!

183
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,210
Those of the Celestial Palace

184
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,020
may look fancy on the surface,

185
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,730
but in truth,

186
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,450
you're nothing

187
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,060
but cowards who won't admit your crime!

188
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,900
Spineless clowns!

189
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,660
I dare you

190
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,300
to return

191
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,690
the pork knuckle I gave you!

192
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,730
Spit it out!

193
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,850
Despicable wretch!

194
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,850
You'd even harm the common folk of the Demon Realm.

195
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,610
This man clearly fell on his own.

196
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,450
Nonsense!

197
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,780
The demon core in your body is unstable.

198
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,970
It's disturbing your mind.

199
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,540
Your inner power is conflicted.

200
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,730
Hence, the discomfort.

201
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,380
And Master,

202
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,450
when I was in meditation, I found

203
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,690
the core had grown much larger.

204
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,540
It must be linked to the resentment you mentioned.

205
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,490
Immortals thrive on spiritual energy.

206
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,210
Demons feed on malice.

207
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,810
That resentment will only fuel the demon core within you.

208
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,940
As the core grows stronger,

209
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,570
once it surpasses your own inner core,

210
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,570
you'll begin to lose your mind

211
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,810
and lose control.

212
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,090
Wouldn't that mean I'd be under this cursed core's control,

213
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,210
and become a mindless shell?

214
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,090
Is there any solution?

215
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,940
To keep you alive,

216
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,490
the demon core has started merging with your inner core.

217
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,330
It can no longer be removed.

218
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,210
If the two cores don't merge, I'll die.

219
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,020
But if they do,

220
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,940
the resentment within will make me a threat.

221
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,260
For now,

222
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,850
we must first resolve the case of Niu San.

223
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,570
Easing the resentment of both realms

224
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,810
might stabilize the demon core for a time.

225
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,420
It's only a stopgap measure.

226
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,780
But as your master, I swear I'll find a cure for you.

227
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,330
Master,

228
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,570
until we do find a way,

229
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,180
don't tell Sima Jiao.

230
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,490
He's only just recovered.

231
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,300
I don't want him worrying about me.

232
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,610
To prove whether Niu San

233
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,380
was truly killed by General Chi

234
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,610
isn't difficult.

235
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,900
However,

236
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,940
to verify it would put General Chi

237
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,210
in an unjust position.

238
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,570
To calm the public uproar,

239
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,330
General Chi, will you prove your innocence?

240
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,260
I have nothing to hide.

241
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,420
Of course I will.

242
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,810
I'll use the Soul Search,

243
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,540
and let everyone see what really happened that night.

244
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,850
Say that again if you dare.

245
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,450
You dare

246
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,850
assault a general!

247
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,660
Stand down!

248
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,730
This banquet in Yan City was held

249
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,570
to celebrate peace between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

250
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,450
And yet you behave in this manner.

251
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,330
Do you mean to go against the command of the Grandmaster

252
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,900
and the Demon Mistress?

253
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,260
Rest assured, General.

254
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,660
We'll find a way

255
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,300
to have payback!

256
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:52,970
Right.

257
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,940
The Gengchen Celestial Palace is nothing!

258
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,140
Nothing but hypocrites with flowery words.

259
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,490
Enough.

260
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,900
Let's go.

261
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,940
Yes.

262
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,290
I'll show you who the real hypocrites are.

263
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,380
A true man doesn't strike the helpless.

264
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,660
Once you're done,

265
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,730
we'll have a proper match.

266
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,140
- Where are you taking me? - General Chi.

267
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,490
Tell him.

268
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,940
I can still drink!

269
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,450
You, come out here!

270
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,900
General Chi.

271
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,660
I can still drink three days and three nights straight!

272
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,580
How are you feeling?

273
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,690
It's nothing.

274
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,580
It seems the most crucial memory is gone.

275
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,690
The technique used to kill Commander Niu San

276
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,970
looked the same as General Chi's.

277
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,420
But the aura within it

278
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,450
matches the demonic energy in me.

279
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,970
Nianjiu,

280
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,420
join me in tracking the demonic trace left

281
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,970
on Niu San's wound

282
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,770
and find out where Mingli is hiding.

283
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,250
He can't be innocent in this.

284
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,490
Yes.

285
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,050
You think swallowing a demon core makes you the Demon Mistress?

286
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,940
Keep dreaming.

287
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,180
Sooner or later, you'll be nothing but my puppet.

288
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,290
What's going on?

289
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,210
Wasn't I just resting in the hall?

290
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,730
How did I end up here?

291
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,100
Yan.

292
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,340
Hongluo.

293
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,530
The streets outside are desolate.

294
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,730
If this matter isn't resolved soon,

295
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,290
Yan City will become a ghost town.

296
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,660
Hongluo.

297
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,050
Here.

298
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,250
I feel there's more

299
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,010
to Niu San's death.

300
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,210
I know.

301
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,050
You think someone is pulling strings in the shadows,

302
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,940
trying to stir up chaos.

303
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,770
Not just that.

304
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,620
I suspect the real target

305
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,290
is me.

306
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,010
On the day of Yan City's upheaval,

307
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,340
the people's resentment fed the demon core.

308
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,180
My master said,

309
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,580
as the demon core grows,

310
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,530
I'll lose my reason and fall under its sway.

311
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,420
That is why I've been irritable and full of spite these days.

312
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,620
I've even lost pieces of memory.

313
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,690
How so?

314
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,250
Just today, one moment I was in the hall,

315
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,210
the next I was in the tavern.

316
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,770
I don't even know how I got here.

317
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,450
During my meditation,

318
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,820
I found out

319
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,860
the demon core has nearly devoured my inner core.

320
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,490
What?

321
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,490
Does Sima Jiao know?

322
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,490
If he knew my inner core was damaged,

323
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,250
he'd be frantic.

324
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,940
I don't want him to worry.

325
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,250
What about Feng Qi?

326
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,450
Have you asked him?

327
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,420
The day after the Yan City banquet,

328
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,530
he asked to go to Ghost City to restore order.

329
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,210
I thought he felt ill at ease in Yan City,

330
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,210
so I let him go.

331
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,210
No! If this drags on,

332
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,580
the demon core

333
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,690
will seize your mind for good!

334
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,820
I'll send word to Ghost City at once,

335
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,970
and send Feng Qi back.

336
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,860
Wait here.

337
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,100
Where's You Yan?

338
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,820
I don't know.

339
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,340
No more lies.

340
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,380
In the mortal realm,

341
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,490
at the entrance to the Nine Nether Purgatory.

342
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,690
The Nine Nether Purgatory?

343
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,050
He wants to release the Demonic Army sealed there.

344
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,940
Where is the entrance?

345
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,820
No spell you use will work.

346
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,420
I don't know where the entrance is either.

347
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,770
And Bi'an?

348
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,900
She's already been possessed by the former Demon Lord.

349
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,210
Are you involved

350
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,010
in Niu San's death?

351
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,580
Yes.

352
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,140
I infused Feng Qi with demonic energy.

353
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,010
That energy let me use his obsession to control him.

354
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,900
So, Feng Qi was helping Liao Tingyan merge her cores

355
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,530
because you planned it.

356
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,820
The Chang clan's secret art can indeed merge cores,

357
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,210
but the Demon Lord's core is too powerful.

358
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,530
Even if they merge, the evil one will devour the other,

359
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,490
never the other way around.

360
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,420
When that happens, she'll be utterly reduced

361
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,770
to the former Demon Lord's puppet.

362
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,660
Grandmaster.

363
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,210
Was he involved in Niu San's murder?

364
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,690
Yes.

365
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,490
Tingyan is in danger.

366
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,620
Yan.

367
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,620
Sima Jiao!

368
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,970
Tingyan.

369
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,730
Why did you kill Niu San?

370
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,100
By using his death to stir up chaos between Immortals and Demons,

371
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,010
resentment would spread in the world.

372
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,580
That would strengthen the Demon Lord's core

373
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,490
inside Yan.

374
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,970
Only then could I kill Sima Jiao.

375
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,010
And only then would nothing stand between me and Yan!

376
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,210
When chaos engulfs both realms,

377
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,180
Liao Tingyan will be nothing more than my puppet. I, You Yan, pull the strings.

378
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,210
Everyone,

379
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,380
you all heard him.

380
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,690
So he was the real culprit!

381
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,730
Only your death will ease our anger!

382
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,050
- Kill him! - Finish him!

383
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,210
You brought them here to eavesdrop?

384
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,730
Despicable.

385
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,050
But what of it?

386
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,660
Liao Tingyan is already under the demon energy's control.

387
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,490
Sima Jiao, you might suppress it for a time,

388
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,940
but never for life.

389
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,340
Liao Tingyan,

390
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,690
arise!

391
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,690
Kill him!

392
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,860
Yan!

393
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,620
Grandmaster!

394
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,010
Tingyan.

395
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,860
It's me, Tingyan.

396
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,580
Wake up.

397
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,660
Tingyan!

398
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,620
What happened?

399
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,940
Tingyan.

400
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,860
I didn't hurt you, did I?

401
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:39,820
No.

402
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,420
Yan.

403
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,580
Feng Qi.

404
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,050
I know your heart still clings to that Frost Fish.

405
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,530
But I'm not her.

406
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,820
She and I are two completely different people.

407
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,620
Do you understand?

408
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,180
Yan...

409
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,660
You are now

410
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,660
happy,

411
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,730
right?

412
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,180
That's

413
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,140
enough.

414
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,770
Feng Qi.

415
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,380
Yan...

416
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,210
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,340
His cultivation has been destroyed,

418
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,490
and he will soon perish.

419
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,380
He paid a heavy price for this.

420
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,450
This concludes the case.

421
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,180
Yes.

422
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,970
As usual.

423
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,530
The slow one...

424
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,380
treats the rest to wine.

425
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,340
Both of you,

426
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,450
take care.

427
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,770
Tingyan.

428
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,290
Are you alright?

429
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,580
A little better now.

430
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,180
But the demon core still carries demonic energy.

431
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,180
There's still a risk of being controlled.

432
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,530
You Yan has only a shred of soul left.

433
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,010
He is no threat.

434
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,730
I will be in seclusion for a month.

435
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,180
When I emerge,

436
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,970
the demonic energy in you will be gone.

437
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,860
Why must it take so long?

438
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,250
Why can't we get married first?

439
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,340
You wanted us to hold

440
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,340
the ceremony soon.

441
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,770
Is the demonic energy in me too hard to purge?

442
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,140
Or has the wound you took in the White Bone Abyss

443
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,010
relapsed?

444
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,010
Who is Sima Jiao?

445
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,380
Sima Jiao is the greatest Grandmaster the Gengchen Celestial Palace

446
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,530
has ever known.

447
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,730
Then, put your heart at ease.

448
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,140
When I return,

449
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,250
we will be married.

450
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,050
Alright.

451
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,770
I've never seen this design before.

452
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,400
Good.

453
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,640
Great.

454
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,560
Great.

455
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,660
A little higher.

456
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,770
Come again next time.

457
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,910
- Great. - I'll take two.

458
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,600
Thank you.

459
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:07,970
Take this.

460
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,380
Don't get emotional.

461
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,730
It's leftovers.

462
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,690
Hold it tight.

463
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,990
Come again next time.

464
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,860
Who said I'm touched?

465
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,010
It's ruined embroidery.

466
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,430
Step right up, take a look.

467
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,100
Grandmaster once said,

468
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,580
as long as you uphold

469
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,820
peace between the two realms,

470
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,490
and respect the new Demon Mistress,

471
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,050
you'll be granted endless spiritual power.

472
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,660
Yet you ungrateful fools

473
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,940
not only stirred up strife between Immortals and Demons,

474
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,140
you even plotted to have her killed!

475
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,140
Are you so tired of living?

476
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,140
What's so great about her?

477
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,250
Why should she be our ruler?

478
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,580
Slaughtering the weak.

479
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,180
Is that what you call strength?

480
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,250
The weak deserve to die anyway.

481
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,690
We follow the Demon Mistress.

482
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,450
Out.

483
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,290
Yes.

484
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,380
Grandmaster.

485
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,290
What's wrong?

486
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,580
Didn't your wounds heal in Thunder Valley?

487
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,490
I have only just recovered.

488
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,770
I still need rest.

489
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,770
Hence, the seclusion.

490
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,180
Don't tell Tingyan of this.

491
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,380
Yes.

492
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,610
Sima Jiao.

493
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,170
Snuff out whatever foolish idea

494
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,300
you have in your head.

495
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,700
I don't care if you die, I still want to live!

496
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,570
You are becoming more and more like her now.

497
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,380
You even eavesdrop now.

498
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,380
Grandmaster.

499
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,170
What did the little flame mean

500
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,570
by its words?

501
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,740
When was it your place to question me?

502
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,490
Even if I must defy you,

503
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,220
I still have the right to ask for answers.

504
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,530
Do you really think

505
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,130
Thunderbolts could truly heal him?

506
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,610
It only slowed

507
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,010
Spirit Fire's drain on his life.

508
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,260
Grandmaster.

509
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,820
Then, how will you

510
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,420
ever recover?

511
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,170
What recovery is there?

512
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,130
There's none.

513
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,820
If he hadn't sought death himself,

514
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,650
he could've lived another 70 to 80 years.

515
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,940
Now he can't even endure another year.

516
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,010
That's nonsense.

517
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,900
Grandmaster and Tingyan are living happily.

518
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,450
Why would he wish to die?

519
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,610
Grandmaster still means to purify Tingyan's demon core.

520
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,170
Purify...

521
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,940
Purify the demon core...

522
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,570
You've not been a city lord for nothing.

523
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,090
Grandmaster.

524
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,450
Be honest with me.

525
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,170
Must Tingyan's demon core be purified

526
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,050
at the cost of the Grandmaster's life?

527
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,050
I am not dead yet.

528
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,300
It's not your time to mourn.

529
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,050
Grandmaster.

530
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,780
Then we...

531
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,450
we still have other ways, right?

532
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,090
But if you actually leave us one day,

533
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,300
what will become of Tingyan?

534
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,970
In both realms now,

535
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,010
there are only the ones she loves.

536
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,170
I've already carved their fear of the Spirit Fire

537
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,780
deep into their very bones.

538
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,260
They fear the Spirit Fire.

539
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,340
They fear me too.

540
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,940
When word spreads that she slew me and seized the Spirit Fire,

541
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,260
her name as Immortal-Demon Ruler

542
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,420
will be unshaken.

543
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,860
But if that happens,

544
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,860
you won't survive.

545
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,170
Grandmaster.

546
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,170
Grandmaster.

547
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,610
Grandmaster.

548
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,700
Grandmaster.

549
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,300
If she lives,

550
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,940
then I live.

551
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,570
Don't let her know of this.

552
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,780
Good. The hands are still cold.

553
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,740
If they were warm, it'd be an ill omen.

554
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,170
What is it?

555
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,380
Weren't you in seclusion?

556
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,650
Why are you sleeping like a log?

557
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,220
This is my method of relaxing in seclusion.

558
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,820
I learned it from you.

559
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,260
Where's the little flame?

560
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,450
I haven't seen it around lately.

561
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,300
It's noisy.

562
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,450
I locked it away.

563
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,170
I am still in seclusion.

564
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,090
Yet you barge in.

565
