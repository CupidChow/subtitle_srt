[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,500
[Episode 11]
[I think I've Become a Hopeless Romantic]

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,450
But

23
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,170
why is there

24
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,370
Fengshan bloodline here?

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,890
The Fengshan Clan

26
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,060
has always pursued bloodline purity.

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,090
But over the years,

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,220
some have

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,010
defied their elders, run off,

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,370
and had children with outsiders.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,650
Shi Qianlv

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,090
has gone to great lengths to gather people of the Fengshan bloodline.

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,580
He is playing a long game.

34
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,810
But what could Shi Qianlv possibly do

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,130
with those people?

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,570
It's for his own selfish desires.

37
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,060
I told you before

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,130
that people in the Gengchen Celestial Palace are all the same.

39
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,090
They will do anything for cultivation.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,220
Right now, we just need to find out

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,410
where the Shi family took those children,

42
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,570
and we will know his true motives.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,460
But the only one who knows about this

44
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,080
is Master Yan.

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,050
We have no choice but to wait for his return.

46
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,620
After all, no one even knows where he is.

47
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,020
Why wait?

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,740
He will come back to me of his own will.

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,620
Please elaborate, Grandmaster.

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,090
I will ruin the Yan Residence

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,410
in Yan Huan's disguise,

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,060
and that old man will have no choice but to return.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,410
How does it feel to be used

54
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,220
as a breeding vessel,

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,340
living in constant manipulation?

56
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,900
Am I really living at all?

57
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,690
Even when I pretended to be a wastrel lost in wine and women,

58
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,570
my family still refused to leave me alone.

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,130
Living such a miserable life,

60
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,130
I might as well be dead.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,690
I'm nothing more than a walking corpse.

62
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,570
You would rather live in disgrace

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,500
than die with dignity?

64
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,890
Easy for you to say.

65
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,450
I wanted to end it all, too,

66
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,860
but it's not that easy to take my own life.

67
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,060
You haven't been through what I have.

68
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,420
You won't understand.

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,100
Once everything is over,

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,330
I will end it for you.

71
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,210
Then that would be best.

72
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,740
So the Grandmaster wants to cause unrest in the Yan family

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,980
to lure Master Yan back early?

74
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,770
He makes the plans,

75
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,370
and I carry them out.

76
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,180
This is a big project.

Liao Tingyan!

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,770

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,740
which should I choose?

97

What is it? What are you looking at?

98

Nothing.

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,620
I will be right back.

103

If I hadn't followed you in secret,

107
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,330
I doubt you would've ever told me

108

that Liao Tingyan was still alive.

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,010

Canglan,

111
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,500
don't do anything to Liao Tingyan.

I'm sure there will be a way to have the best of both worlds.

that if Sima Jiao catches wind of this,

122

both of us will end up losing everything?

But this pink outfit

189
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,420
doesn't quite brighten you up.

190
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,210
Even when making small talk, I blurt out my real thoughts.

191
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,940
It's so embarrassing.

192
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,140
How rude of you!

193
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,490
You're in no position to comment on my clothes.

194
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,330
I'm so sorry.

195
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,660
Grandmaster, could you please

196
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,140
remove the Truth Spell for me?

197
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,260
I know people in Chiyan City are at lower realms

198
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,730
and can't see the spell mark on my forehead,

199
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,780
but if I keep blurting out

200
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,610
whatever's on my mind,

201
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,970
they're going to think I'm weird.

202
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,780
Maybe they'll even

203
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,180
beat me up one day, you know?

204
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,610
As I said, it's a punishment.

205
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,810
If someone's willing to save me the trouble and give you a beating,

206
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,970
that wouldn't be such a bad thing.

207
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,090
What kind of schoolkid behavior is that?

208
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,300
So you're pleased with what I did,

209
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,090
since you called me a "schoolkid."

210
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,610
"Schoolkid" isn't a compliment.

211
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,450
It means you're childish, petty, and ridiculous...

212
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,210
Liao Tingyan, shut your mouth already!

213
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,450
At this point,

214
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,850
you might as well keep going.

215
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,060
I wouldn't dare...

216
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,210
I said that because you made me.

217
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,850
If you remove the spell,

218
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,020
I'll shower you with all the flattery you want.

219
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,660
Fake flattery is boring.

220
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,090
I have no interest in it.

221
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,420
Greetings, sir.

222
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,380
Sir, may I stay here?

223
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,730
I have no one else to rely on.

224
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,610
I'm willing to stay and serve you day and night.

225
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,450
No need.

226
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,660
I'm not used to having someone around.

227
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,780
Isn't that right?

228
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,450
You seem pretty used to it to me.

229
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,260
You fell asleep with me in your arms last night.

230
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,020
So you sent us away

231
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,490
because of this young lady?

232
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,450
That's right.

233
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,420
She's the only one I want by my side.

234
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,940
Happy?

235
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,970
"Happy" isn't the word. More like shocked.

236
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,060
Where are you going with this?

237
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,660
This wasn't in the script.

238
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,020
I think you're so secretly delighted

239
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,260
that you're starting to babble nonsense.

240
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,380
Lady, I'll tell you the truth.

241
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,330
I'm actually an otter,

242
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,780
and he's not the real Mr. Yan. I...

243
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,380
What she means is

244
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,020
that I no longer wish to be Young Master Yan,

245
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,810
and that I want to live by my own rules.

246
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,300
I get it.

247
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,940
I will forever pray for happiness for you and the young lady.

248
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,540
See? If you don't lift the spell,

249
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,810
it'll backfire

250
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,810
and ruin your grand plan.

251
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,090
I don't know about any "grand plan."

252
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,090
All I know is someone called me a schoolkid.

253
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,420
And the Truth Spell will last another five days.

254
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,450
Are you cursing me in your head right now?

255
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,210
Yes.

256
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,900
Then I'll add another five days.

257
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,090
So you're giving me a taste

258
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,210
of my own medicine

259
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,940
by trapping me here?

260
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,090
Stay here and reflect on what you did.

261
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,330
And stop thinking about parting ways with me.

262
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,140
I will find a way

263
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,260
to earn Sima Jiao's trust quickly.

264
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,610
I won't let our plan be hindered.

265
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,780
You'll find a way?

266
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,260
You've been in Chiyan City for days

267
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,380
and still haven't figured out how to activate

268
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,260
Liao Tingyan's extreme-cold nature, have you?

269
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,060
I've hit the mark, haven't I?

270
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,780
Ruling, stop fooling yourself.

271
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,260
At this point, our only option is to take

272
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,900
Liao Tingyan's core.

273
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,570
There is another option.

274
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,900
Kill Sima Jiao.

275
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,570
Easier said than done. Do you even realize what he's capable of?

276
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,140
You don't stand a chance.

277
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,810
An opportunity will come.

278
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,300
Ruling,

279
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,140
please, get your priorities straight.

280
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,780
Grandmaster.

281
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,020
Did you tell the Shi family

282
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,970
where Liao Tingyan was?

283
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,810
I have never revealed

284
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,940
a single word to anyone.

285
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,660
Then why did you come to Chiyan City looking for us?

286
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,490
I was worried about Tingyan's safety,

287
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,730
and I didn't believe you had truly killed her.

288
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,610
So I resorted

289
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,210
to using a firefly to track her down.

290
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,610
Please forgive me, Grandmaster.

291
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,450
If I find out you have divided loyalties,

292
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,380
I will kill you without hesitation.

293
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,060
I would not dare.

294
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,620
I wonder what Mr. Yan is up to today.

295
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,940
First, he dismissed all the concubines.

296
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,820
Then he ordered everyone to take inventory of Master Yan's property.

297
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,100
It's pretty alarming.

298
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,290
Miss, I heard from a concubine who left the residence

299
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,580
that Mr. Yan was very fond of you.

300
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,940
We're both servants here.

301
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,340
- Could you put in a good word for me, your big brother... - Big brother?

302
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,770
And help me become a steward or something?

303
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,730
If there's anything you need in the future,

304
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,580
I'll help you, too.

305
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,420
Thank you, big brother.

306
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,250
But judging by your looks, you're more like my uncle.

307
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,730
I'm only in my early twenties.

308
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,210
I'm so sorry.

309
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,450
I saw your receding hairline

310
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,660
and thought you were over 50...

311
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,340
Sorry, I mean no offense.

312
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,940
I'll let it slide for Mr. Yan's sake!

313
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,620
You're so rude!

314
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,690
Miss?

315
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,530
Sore throat?

316
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,140
Maybe you're just too tired.

317
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,970
Get some rest.

318
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,660
I'll get back to work.

319
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,490
Can everyone please stop talking to me?

320
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,180
I've offended so many people in just one day.

321
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,690
Grandmaster.

322
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,820
What are you doing?

323
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,210
Looks like it's working.

324
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,660
I don't have to worry anymore.

325
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,340
If I can't hear, I don't have to answer.

326
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,940
Interesting,

327
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,380
Liao Tingyan.

328
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,050
Whether you praise me or scold me,

329
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,050
- I can't hear you. - There's a pond behind you.

330
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,620
You don't

331
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,340
actually think this makes you look good, do you?

332
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,140
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

333
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,620
You're trying to mess with me.

334
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,340
I warned you

335
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,050
there was a pond behind you.

336
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,690
You didn't listen.

337
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,180
What could I do?

338
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,010
You're going to such lengths

339
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,860
just to amuse me now.

340
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,970
And you've been putting

341
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,140
a lot of effort into playing tricks on me today, schoolkid.

342
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,620
If you want to keep this up,

343
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,860
I'm all in.

344
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,340
So do you?

345
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,770
No.

346
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,820
Pull me up.

347
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,420
Let's go have some fun with the steward here.

348
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,860
Sir,

349
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,050
Master Yan's belongings are all here.

350
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,010
Go to the bank and take all the money out.

351
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,450
Well...

352
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,250
And tell the servants outside

353
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,900
they can take whatever they want from the chests

354
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,340
in the courtyard.

355
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,380
Then they can leave the residence.

356
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,420
Sir,

357
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,380
those are Master Yan's most prized treasures.

358
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,180
I...

359
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,420
Understood.

360
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,620
What is Mr. Yan trying to do?

361
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,140
I wonder where Master Yan is now.

362
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,620
This won't do.

363
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,770
I must send someone to get the news to him at once.

364
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,340
Hopefully, when he hears it,

365
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,530
he will hurry back.

366
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,970
There are no jewels, gold, or silver

367
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,290
in these chests.

368
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,100
How come they're the most popular?

369
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,660
Miss,

370
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,250
there's something you don't know.

371
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,380
People in this city are mostly at low realms,

372
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,530
but Master Yan is a great admirer of immortal arts.

373
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,620
These are all magical artifacts he has collected

374
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,970
from all over the Celestial Palace.

375
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,940
Magical artifacts?

376
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,420
Yes.

377
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,730
Look.

378
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,860
This is the Sound Channeler,

379
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,620
and this

380
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,530
is the Mirror of Reversal.

381
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,420
It can

382
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,730
briefly reflect the opponent's spells back at them.

383
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,010
This is a pair

384
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,970
of Lovebond Plaques.

385
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,450
If you carve

386
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,380
two people's names on them,

387
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,970
the two will fall in love.

388
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,050
I've long been infatuated with a pleasure house's top courtesan.

389
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,730
I plan to carve both our names on them.

390
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,730
The top courtesan?

391
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,660
I don't think you're worthy of her.

392
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,050
You... You've gone too far!

393
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,730
Sorry.

394
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,970
I didn't mean to say that out loud.

395
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,620
I'll apologize.

396
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,010
When I apologize, I mean it, too!

397
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,860
I don't want to hear it!

398
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,530
When is Sima Jiao

399
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,100
going to lift the Truth Spell?

400
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,010
Mirror of Reversal?

401
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,820
Sima Jiao,

402
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,010
we need to talk.

403
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,580
About what?

404
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,490
How much longer do you plan to let

405
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,970
the Truth Spell make a fool out of me?

406
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,180
Could you please remove it?

407
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,380
It's really causing

408
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,660
serious trouble in my life.

409
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,940
Do you admit you were wrong?

410
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,490
Why did you

411
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,730
lie to me in the first place?

412
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,580
I've already explained.

413
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,730
I had my reasons.

414
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,620
Why do you have to force me to tell the truth?

415
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,180
What's wrong with wanting a little privacy?

416
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,730
I can't even keep my own thoughts

417
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,660
to myself.

418
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,900
It's really exhausting!

419
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,900
I can't stand empty pleasantries

420
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,970
and lies,

421
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,730
so I don't want anyone

556
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,530
What's wrong with that?

557
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,770
The news of a son's death is probably

558
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,690
the most effective way to lure that old man back.

559
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,690
Can we not be so violent?

560
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,340
Can't we handle this a little more humanely?

561
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,450
For him, this would be a kind of release.

562
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,420
How can death be a release?

563
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,050
Isn't there another way?

564
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,380
Then what do you suggest?

565
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,250
Just stop him from being used

566
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,010
as a breeding vessel.

567
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,180
Why don't we help him elope with Ms. Qing'er?

568
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,690
That would still hinder the Yan family's plan

569
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,340
to strengthen the Fengshan bloodline.

570
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,860
And Master Yan would still return.

571
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,490
You want to drag Mr. Yan out of the mire?

572
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,660
Don't bother.

573
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,180
It will only be a waste of effort.

574
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,940
Where there's a will, there's a way.

575
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,180
I believe we can do it.

576
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,340
Trust me, Grandmaster.

577
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,490
You really won't turn back until you hit a wall.

578
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,530
We won't know until we try.

579
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,940
I'll go help Ms. Qing'er get ready, then.

580
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,820
Have you heard?

581
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,180
Mr. Yan suddenly dismissed all his concubines

582
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,100
and gave each one a huge relocation fee.

583
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,940
He gave each of them a relocation fee?

584
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,010
It's true!

585
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:48,770
No.

586
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,420
He formally divorced them.

587
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,820
Not only that,

588
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,420
he even divided up the family assets among the servants

589
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,490
and let them all go.

590
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,450
Really?

591
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,860
I knew it. Things are a complete mess now.

592
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,290
What do you think he's up to?

593
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,180
Why is Mr. Yan suddenly acting so recklessly?

594
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,100
I don't get it.

595
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,380
Have you heard?

596
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,860
Mr. Yan is planning to elope with Ms. Qing'er, a courtesan

597
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,340
he used to secretly meet at the pleasure house.

598
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,780
He's thrown away everything in the Yan family for her.

599
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,450
- Is that true? - Of course it is.

600
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,610
When Master Yan returns, there will be a real show to watch.

601
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,530
Definitely.

602
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,020
[Yan Residence]

603
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,500
[Master Yan]

604
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,820
What has gotten into you?

605
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,780
I heard while I was away

606
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,260
that you'd been making a mess at home!

607
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,970
You squandered the family fortune

608
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,570
and dismissed all your concubines,

609
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,610
and now you want to elope with a courtesan?

610
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,170
If you keep this up,

611
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,260
how will the matter I entrusted to you ever move forward?

612
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,570
What matter?

613
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,490
Tell me.

614
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,740
You actually forgot what I told you?

615
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,940
Useless fool!

616
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,300
Those cheap women out there

617
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,420
have completely bewitched you.

618
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,530
Listen,

619
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,380
from now on, you're not allowed to go out again!

620
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,860
I'll get you a few more concubines

621
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,340
so you can have more children.

622
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,380
Otherwise,

623
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,260
our family will be in misery,

624
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,780
and you won't live in comfort either!

625
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,340
Who

626
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,700
are those children for?

627
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,940
You...!

628
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,490
Has the pleasure house

629
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,220
rotted your brain?

630
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,450
You haven't even called me Father once since you came in.

631
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,740
You're a disgrace!

632
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,610
You want me to call you Father?

633
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,380
I don't think you deserve that kind of respect yet.

634
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,970
You!

635
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,530
Who are you?

636
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,340
You're not my son.

637
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,770
I am your ancestor.

638
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,350
Insolent brat, how dare you insult me?

639
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,610
Tell me the truth behind the flame-shaped birthmark

640
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,170
on Yan Huan's back.

641
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,130
The Yan family and the Sima clan both belong to the Fengshan lineage.

642
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,090
Every few generations,

643
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,780
someone in the Yan family is born with Sima blood,

644
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,700
and they will have that flame-shaped birthmark on their back.

645
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,900
And what do you do with such people?

646
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,050
When a child like that is born,

647
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,380
they will immediately be sent to that place.

648
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,700
If their bloodline power is strong enough,

649
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,300
they will stay there permanently,

650
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,170
and our family will be rewarded with great benefits.

651
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,420
If their power is weaker,

652
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,420
like my son Yan Huan's,

653
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,220
they will be allowed to return home.

654
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,130
What is that place?

655
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,530
Baifeng Mountain.

656
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,260
Where is it?

657
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,740
I don't know.

658
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,260
Emissaries come to pick them up.

659
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,700
We can't go near.

660
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,260
We can only stay outside.

661
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,260
If I want to get to Baifeng Mountain quickly,

662
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,260
how do I do that?

663
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,380
You'll have to wait.

664
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,380
The emissaries from Baifeng Mountain contact us, not the other way around.

665
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,530
At the end of each month,

666
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,170
they come

667
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,170
to the residence to check for pregnancies.

668
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,090
If there's a newborn,

669
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,090
they will examine

670
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,900
whether the child belongs to the Fengshan bloodline.

671
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,650
If they do,

672
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,570
they will be taken to Baifeng Mountain immediately,

673
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,740
and I will go along as well.

674
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,970
So all that is needed is a child?

675
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,340
Not a problem at all.

676
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,820
Have you memorized

677
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,970
everything I taught you?

678
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,050
I even practice it in my sleep.

679
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,300
Grandmaster.

680
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,220
Nianjiu,

681
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,340
after you keep Master Yan confined in the residence,

682
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,780
I need you to do something else for me.

683
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,700
You can refuse politely

684
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,740
by saying...

685
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,050
Uh...

686
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,380
This doesn't look right.

687
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,170
What did you say?

688
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,010
How is it wrong to do something for me?

689
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,700
If the other person insists,

690
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,970
just keep declining politely

691
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,050
by saying...

692
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,260
I don't have the time.

693
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,420
And if I tell you to make time?

694
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,260
Then you can be more direct

695
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,420
and give a firm refusal.

696
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,530
No, I can't.

697
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,640
Nianjiu,

698
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,220
are you tired of living or something?

699
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,970
What kind of poison have you been feeding him?

700
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,900
My apologies, Grandmaster.

701
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,260
I just

702
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,860
taught him a few ways

703
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,130
of speaking and dealing with people.

704
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,700
You mean you taught him how to betray his Grandmaster?

705
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,340
I wouldn't dare.

706
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,450
That's quite an accusation.

707
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:57,970
Grandmaster,

708
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,420
this really has nothing to do with Ruling.

709
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,340
I was the one pestering her to teach me

710
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,970
how to be a better person.

711
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,940
The first lesson I learned

712
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,380
from her

713
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,610
was how to say no to people,

714
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,090
because I wanted

715
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,050
to stop acting

716
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,340
like some domesticated animal,

717
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,700
obedient to everyone about everything.

718
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,010
Instead of learning from her,

719
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,900
you should have come to me to learn how to be a person.

720
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,970
Grandmaster,

721
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,050
stop giving Nianjiu a hard time.

722
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,340
I need to go find Mr. Yan now.

723
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,080
Why don't you turn me back into a human?

724
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,050
Tingyan.

725
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,860
You're toast.

726
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,420
So the otter was Tingyan?

727
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,170
In a few days,

728
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,220
I'll be going to Baifeng Mountain with Master Yan.

729
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,450
Return to keep watch

730
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,570
on the Shi family and the Eight Palaces for me.

731
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,130
If anything unusual happens,

732
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,340
report to me immediately.

733
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,860
Understood.

734
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,740
If I can make a contribution to this

735
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,090
and gain Sima Jiao's trust,

736
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,570
then whether I choose to kill or use him later,

737
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,570
I may be able

738
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,900
to break the Immortal-Demon Barrier faster.

739
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,970
Grandmaster,

740
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,420
let me go with Nianjiu.

741
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,010
Fine.

742
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,570
Report to me immediately

743
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,340
if anything happens.

744
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,970
Understood.

745
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,090
Mr. Yan.

746
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,490
Please come with me.

747
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,570
Ms. Qing'er and your daughter are waiting for you.

748
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,780
No,

749
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,700
I'm not going.

750
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,610
I can't put them in danger.

751
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,170
They'd be better off

752
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,050
staying far away from me.

753
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,700
Pull yourself together.

754
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,380
Your father has told us about Baifeng Mountain.

755
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,130
My Grand...

756
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,300
My young master is very powerful.

757
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,420
You can count on him to take care of things there

758
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,010
and ensure your safety.

759
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,570
We've already paved the way for you.

760
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,450
From now on, you can live however you want.

761
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,570
How can I possibly live a carefree life

762
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,650
after going through something like this?

763
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,090
The Fengshan bloodline

764
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,380
will one day drag me back

765
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,740
into tragedy.

766
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,740
