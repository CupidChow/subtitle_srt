Chuhui's cultivation was so high, yet she failed the selection.

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,090
Why not?

190
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,210
I'm just an innocent slacker.

191
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,800
With cultivation this low,

192
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,730
why would I want to kill you?

193
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,300
Really?

194
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,330
What else?

195
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,370
Are you scared of everything or what?

196
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,540
Is your brain broken?

197
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,940
I'm doomed.

198
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,420
This spell is deadly.

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,180
Help!

200
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,730
Are you killing me or not?

201
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,420
Make it quick!

202
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,540
I wouldn't dare.

203
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,490
Has he been in seclusion so long

204
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,850
that his mind's gone?

205
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,450
Gengchen Celestial Palace

206
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,780
had it wrong from the start.

207
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,850
Why send in disciples to serve him?

208
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,300
They should've sent a doctor

209
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,420
to fix his head.

210
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,960
Get off.

211
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,690
Don't lick me, you mangy mutt.

212
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,680
Mr. Snake,

213
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,100
look at my scrawny arms and legs.

214
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,420
Spare me, will you?

215
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,060
I'd only get stuck in your teeth!

216
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,790
You want to drink this?

217
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,350
You should've said so.

218
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,300
Here you go.

219
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,610
Sorry about that.

220
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,810
I wasn't thinking.

221
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,810
Actually,

222
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,780
this is a specialty of our Serene Vale.

223
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,140
This Spirit Bamboo

224
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,260
keeps producing Spirit Dew.

225
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,020
I usually drink it like milk tea.

226
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,020
Didn't think you'd like it too.

227
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,810
Why's this snake acting like a dog?

228
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,660
To raise a giant serpent into a loyal hound...

229
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,850
Grandmaster truly lives up to his name.

230
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,330
Looks like I've bought myself another day?

231
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,730
I feel awful!

232
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,610
I feel awful!

233
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,260
I feel awful!

234
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,610
You dare drink something from the Demon Realm?

235
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,780
Tired of living, are you?

236
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,380
Just because you ate with her twice,

237
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,540
you're speaking up for her now?

238
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,490
All men are greedy,

239
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,140
let alone those from the Demon Realm.

240
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,490
They either want the Spirit Fire

241
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,690
or covet the Bloodseal Bloom.

242
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,020
She's just better at pretending than the rest.

243
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,900
Aunt-Master Nisheng,

244
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,010
Yu Rongrong from Moon Palace vanished last night.

245
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,140
Not even a body was found.

246
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,250
And once you enter this mountain, you can't leave.

247
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,050
[Xiao Jincheng, Disciple of Heaven Palace]
No way back to the palace now...

248
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,970
No one can guess Grandmaster's temper.

249
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,690
Don't panic yet.

250
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,580
No matter what,

251
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,550
staying alive is what matters.

252
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,340
If one of us

253
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,580
can win Grandmaster's favor

254
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,770
and become his consort,

255
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,810
our Heaven Palace

256
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,680
will rise to lead the Eight Palaces.

257
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,730
Sima Jiao is just as the Master said,

258
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,770
cruel and lawless.

259
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,010
We must find his weakness

260
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,490
and kill him as soon as possible.

261
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,420
The Fengshan Spirit Fire has merged with Sima Jiao.

262
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,230
[Tan Muying, Disciple of Yin Palace]

263
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,420
If Sima Jiao dies,

264
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,970
the Spirit Fire will go out too.

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,450
Then

266
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,970
all of Gengchen Celestial Palace

267
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,290
will lose its spiritual energy.

268
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,530
How will we cultivate?

269
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,770
The Bloodseal Bloom is grown by the Spirit Fire

270
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,820
feeding on Sima Jiao's blood.

271
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,420
Eat the Bloom and his blood,

272
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,380
and we can still raise our power.

273
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,450
Have you forgotten what the Master said?

274
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,820
Back then, he offended Sima Jiao.

275
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,140
If one day

276
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,290
Sima Jiao decides to settle old scores,

277
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,860
we'll all die miserably.

278
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,100
What cultivation's left?

279
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,490
So, you called me here

280
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,080
just to discuss

281
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,820
this impossible task?

282
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,380
Ye Ruling,

283
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,140
stop acting like it's none of your business.

284
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,250
Don't forget

285
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,900
your clansmen are still in the Master's hands.

286
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,970
I've prepared this for Mr. Snake.

287
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,140
Hope he won't wake me tonight

288
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,660
so I can get a good night's sleep.

289
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,190
Why does this feel so familiar?

290
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,250
Do cultivators get period cramps too?

291
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,900
It hurts so much...

292
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,100
Why's it getting worse?

293
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,940
Didn't Mingli say

294
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,690
this Companion Bell can trigger

295
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,050
Liao Tingyan's Bone-Eroding Venom?

296
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,490
Why has she shown no reaction

297
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,660
after hearing the call?

298
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,100
Does she really think

299
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,900
that by clinging to Sima Jiao,

300
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,660
she can escape our control?

301
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,010
Fine.

302
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,290
Let's see how long you can survive

303
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,450
this Bone-Eroding Venom!

304
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,140
Stupid snake,

305
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,100
what did you bring back?

306
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,180
She's been poisoned by demonic venom.

307
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,620
Why do you want to save her?

308
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,670
Do you even know why she's here?

309
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,180
You brought her to me this cluelessly?

310
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,700
Are you looking to die?

311
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,210
This poison

312
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,050
is just a demonic trick

313
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,450
to control puppets.

314
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,100
She actually fell asleep.

315
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,420
The Demon Realm went to all that trouble,

316
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,690
only to send someone like this?

317
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,180
Looks like

318
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,210
she's smarter than those other fools.

319
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,940
Instead of rushing to my face to die,

320
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,420
she won over that stupid snake.

321
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,860
Such deep scheming

322
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,050
suits that face.

323
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,620
Grandmaster...

324
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,140
Why am I in your hall?

325
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,340
Nice act.

326
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,210
You dared use that stupid snake

327
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,530
to bring you to my Central Tower?

328
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,580
Maybe I passed out last night

329
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,730
from the stomach pain.

330
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,970
I guess Mr. Snake got worried

331
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,530
and wanted you to save me.

332
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,620
I didn't mean to trouble you.

333
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,250
My stomach doesn't hurt anymore?

334
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,210
You drank my blood.

335
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,210
Of course it won't hurt.

336
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,100
I drank your blood?

337
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,250
If you dare spit it out, I'll kill you.

338
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,490
Your blood even works as a painkiller?

339
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,860
Not only eases pain,

340
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,820
it boosts cultivation too.

341
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,450
No one in this world doesn't want it.

342
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,140
Count me out.

343
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,900
I'm not that interested.

344
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,210
Looking at you now

345
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,970
makes me want to finish you on the spot.

346
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,240
No...

347
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,490
I...

348
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,250
I may dirty your hands...

349
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,140
If it hurt that much,

350
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,010
why didn't you just kill me?

351
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,450
Because no reason, no grudge.

352
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,660
In this world,

353
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,620
killing doesn't need a grudge,

354
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,210
much less a reason.

355
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,100
Like right now,

356
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,900
no grudge, no reason,

357
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,100
I just want to kill you.

358
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,010
And what can you do about it?

359
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,210
Nothing.

360
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,530
I can't beat you anyway.

361
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,970
You want me to kill you?

362
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,970
Well, I won't.

363
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,210
From now on,

364
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,860
you'll serve me.

365
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,730
Me?

366
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,970
I'm leaving now.

367
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,490
No grudge...

368
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,380
no reason...

369
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,530
so she won't kill me?

370
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,010
Everyone in Gengchen Celestial Palace is after my blood.

371
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,620
If not for the fact that only I can feed the Spirit Fire,

372
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,210
if not for the Spirit Fire nourishing the whole palace,

373
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,730
if not for the fact they can't defeat me,

374
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,660
I'd have been torn apart long ago.

375
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,970
The Demon Realm has always wanted to destroy this palace

376
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,250
and extinguish the Spirit Fire.

377
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,420
They should want to kill me.

378
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,010
So why...

379
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,820
doesn't she want to?

380
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,770
After such a nerve-racking day,

381
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,900
I won't sleep well tonight.

382
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,900
Ridiculous.

383
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,340
The Truth Spell never lies.

384
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,530
If she truly has no intent to kill,

385
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,860
perhaps I can use her.

386
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,530
Five hundred years...

387
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,770
the night of the new moon.

388
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,010
Aunt-Master,

389
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,770
[Central Tower, Three Saints Mountain]
we've waited here every day,

390
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,860
but this door has never opened for us.

391
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,450
Will Grandmaster

392
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,140
really see us?

393
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,420
Don't tell me you're as shallow as the others.

394
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,580
If you're afraid,

395
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,290
then leave.

396
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,380
No, Aunt-Master.

397
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,660
I just don't know how to face Grandmaster.

398
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,010
The Master once said

399
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,940
that before this Grandmaster,

400
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,490
it's impossible to hide anything.

401
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,730
All we need is the most humble

402
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,290
and devout posture,

403
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,420
laying all our thoughts bare to him.

404
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,450
As long as I keep trying,

405
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,420
Grandmaster will be moved by me.

406
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,210
Mr. Snake really meant well but made trouble.

407
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,940
I haven't even rested a few days,

408
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,050
and it's back to work.

409
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,530
I'm here to pay respects to you.

410
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,050
Please accept me, Grandmaster.

411
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,970
She's a brave one,

412
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,250
volunteering to face

413
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,690
that moody grandmaster.

414
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,530
No wonder she can lead the group.

415
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,420
Her mindset is really something.

416
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,250
Wish I could trade places with her.

417
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,530
You're still alive?

418
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,970
What's wrong with you people?

419
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,140
Everyone asks me the same thing.

420
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,820
I'm not dying.

421
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,180
I'm staying alive.

422
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,380
If you want to stay alive,

423
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,770
keep your distance from here.

424
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,900
I'd love to.

425
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,490
What's with Grandmaster?

426
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,420
He asks me to work here

427
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,490
without even giving me a pass.

428
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,380
How am I supposed to get in?

429
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,140
Aunt-Master,

430
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,970
she probably doesn't know Grandmaster's temper.

431
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,450
Should we warn her?

432
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,770
Why meddle?

433
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,940
The only ones safe this close

434
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,180
are you and me.

435
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,140
She'll probably die under this tower today.

436
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,060
Grandmaster, I'm here for work!

437
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,210
How...

438
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,340
how is this possible?

439
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,580
You just knock and it opens?

440
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,580
How did she get in?

441
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,580
What will Grandmaster have me do?

442
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,340
What's in that bag?

443
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,420
These are just

444
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,770
my everyday essentials.

445
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,250
I took them out of my Qiankun Pouch.

446
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,530
I'm not great with spiritual power.

447
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,050
I can only take things out,

448
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,340
not put them in.

449
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,770
Drop your junk

450
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,900
and follow me.

451
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,970
Grandmaster,

452
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:45,210
is that person outside dead?

453
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,770
What do you think?

454
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,450
Why kill her?

455
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,140
Worse than obvious greed,

456
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,210
I hate

457
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,490
mindless puppets with no soul.

458
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,690
Killing her didn't even interest me.

459
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,900
Then why?

460
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,450
She was too noisy

461
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,250
and got on my nerves.

462
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,250
You kill over annoyance?

463
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,100
This grandmaster's crazy.

464
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,210
I'm exhausted.

465
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,050
This is worse than rush hour.

466
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,420
You can't go on?

467
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,900
Grandmaster,

468
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,140
may I ask

469
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,730
why we are

470
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,100
climbing this high?

471
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,580
No reason.

472
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,250
Looks like he's just too bored

473
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,100
and wants to work me to death.

474
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,250
At least I was still human in my old job.

475
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,580
Now in the cultivation world,

476
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,250
I'm just the boss's plaything.

477
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,100
Start by cleaning this floor.

478
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,530
I'll admit, the view here is pretty nice.

479
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,860
It's just that Grandmaster's mood swings

480
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,450
spoil the work experience a bit.

481
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,380
But after 500 years alone in this tower,

482
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,100
it's no wonder his mind's twisted.

483
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,040
Grandmaster,

484
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,490
I'm working hard!

485
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,380
I'm getting things done!

486
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,380
Oh, Mr. Snake, it's you.

487
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,130
I thought the boss was here. You scared me.

488
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,530
What's this about?

489
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,610
Are you taking me somewhere?

490
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,860
Or has Grandmaster done something again?

491
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,010
He dumped me here earlier

492
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,050
without even telling me my work hours.

493
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,450
Are you taking me straight to him?

494
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,090
If he's not sealed,

495
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,970
he'll wipe out the whole palace.

496
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,650
The Spirit Fire has merged with him.

497
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,380
All we need is to keep him alive

498
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,860
to supply us with spiritual energy.

499
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,820
Better add another seal on top of this one.

500
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,570
Tie it into all his meridians

501
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,130
so he can't kill himself.

502
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,530
No matter the pain, he can't seek death.

503
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,970
Grandmaster, spare me!

504
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,820
I didn't do anything.

505
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,530
Your pet brought me here.

506
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,820
Grandmaster,

507
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,300
my spiritual power's too weak.

508
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,230
I can't help you.

509
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,700
Maybe I should clock out early?
