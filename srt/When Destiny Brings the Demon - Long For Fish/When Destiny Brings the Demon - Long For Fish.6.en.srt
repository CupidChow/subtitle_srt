[Episode 6]
[I Learned the Grandmaster's Big Secret. What Do I Do?]

22
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,810
Look at us now.

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,420
Do we still look like we are in charge of the Celestial Palace?

24
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,620
We are nothing

25
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,140
more than puppets to keep the Eight Palaces' glory alive.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,580
People's greed has pushed us

27
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,780
to the brink of despair.

28
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,780
Today, Sima Shi and Sima E are joined as partners

29
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,530
to continue the Fengshan bloodline

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,420
and nourish the Spirit Fire!

31
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,780
There, there.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,650
E,

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,570
give our child a name.

34
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,300
Let's call him Jiao.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,810
This baby is actually the Grandmaster?

36
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,650
So these two

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,650
are the Grandmaster's mother and father?

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,690
What happened?

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,500
It's useless.

40
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,500
They clearly mean

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,060
to trap the Sima clan here.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,970
The late Great Ancestress needs to be buried

43
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,620
outside the mountain.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,180
Why have you sealed

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,570
White Deer Cliff?

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,620
We will have people escort the Great Ancestress out of the mountain

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,740
for burial later.

48
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,180
The Sima clan must remain here to guard the Spirit Fire.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,810
Grandmaster, please stay on White Deer Cliff.

50
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,740
The Eight Palaces aren't even trying to hide their intentions.

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,060
You are treating us like prisoners!

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,970
Do you even have the slightest respect for us Grandmasters?

53
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,370
The array is a joint seal by the Eight Palaces.

54
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,690
It allows entry but no exit.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,060
Please do not waste your efforts trying to break it.

56
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,620
So even the generation before the Grandmaster

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,410
could not escape the fate

58
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,410
of being trapped by the Eight Palaces.

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,570
Grandmaster, Grandmistress!

60
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,460
Weren't you supposed to escort the Great Ancestress's body

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,370
outside the array?

62
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,460
Why have you returned so soon?

63
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,810
Yesterday,

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,340
the eight palace heads

65
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,340
opened a gap in the sealing array

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,300
so I could send the Great Ancestress's body

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,410
outside the cliff for burial.

68
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,780
But then...

69
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,620
Go on.

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,180
But then,

71
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,250
those people from the Eight Palaces

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,780
used her body

73
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,220
for a feast.

74
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,810
What a bunch of monsters!

75
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,650
Has the Grandmaster's father

76
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,970
gone mad?

77
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,130
Is he trying to burn down White Deer Cliff?

78
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,450
What's going on?

79
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,980
- Sima Shi, what are you doing? - What's going on?

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,450
- Sima Shi, what are you doing? - Have you lost your mind?

81
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,770
What...?

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,620
- What are you doing? - Yeah.

83
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,420
What happened?

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,860
He's dead.

85
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,810
Now, only Sima E and her son

86
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,250
can sustain the Spirit Fire.

87
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,300
We cannot let them die as well.

No!

91
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,180
We must make Jiao merge with the Spirit Fire as soon as possible.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,770
That way, the Eight Palaces

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,010
will not dare harm him.

94
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,500
But if he merges with the Spirit Fire,

95
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,540
he will live forever

96
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,500
in the agony of its burning.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,420
I don't want him to live such a life.

98
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,770
Better to end

99
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,330
the Fengshan Clan's generations of tragedy here.

100
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,210
E,

101
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,850
Jiao was born with this mission.

102
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,660
He carries the rare atavistic Fengshan bloodline.

103
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,330
He's both pure and powerful.

104
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,010
He is our clan's hope for revival.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
Do you know the price of absorbing the Fengshan Spirit Fire?

106
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,570
If you fail, both you and your son will die,

107
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,100
and the Sima clan will be wiped out completely.

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,690
I have no other choice.

109
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,500
Today, I offer my flesh, blood, and spirit bones.

110
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,740
Will you merge with my boy

112
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,100
The last thing I wish to take

113
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,620
is your life.

114
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,660
But fine,

115
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,810

you will be the only living person to carry the bloodline of the Sima clan.

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,890
Have I been buried?

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,860
Who buried me?

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,740
Grandmaster, Mr. Snake, little flame,

132
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,690
help!

133
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,770
Open...

134
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,890
You seem really scared.

135
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,570
Why did you put me in a coffin?

136
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,130
You chose a poisonous flower.

137
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,690
Then you fell unconscious for three days and were beyond saving,

138
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,660
so I decided to give you a proper burial.

139
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:25,980
Relax.

140
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,770
I just put you in the coffin to scare you.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,300
I've already neutralized the poison.

142
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,420
So I really picked a poisonous flower?

143
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,330
Didn't you say

144
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,540
only evil people produce poisonous flowers?

145
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,490
But Sima E,

146
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,420
Sima Jiao's mother,

147
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,490
looked so kind-hearted.

148
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,690
No one is purely good or purely evil.

149
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,540
How can a single flower decide that?

150
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,940
Then why was that flower poisonous?

151
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,140
If one dies with a calm and content heart, their bone pearl

152
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,090
produces a healing flower.

153
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,900
If one dies in pain and resentment,

154
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,380
their flower is poisonous.

155
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,090
No wonder.

156
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,060
Judging by your tone,

157
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,140
you saw who this flower came from, didn't you?

158
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,380
He doesn't know the flower I picked

159
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,610
was grown from his mother's bone pearl.

160
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,490
Should I tell him?

161
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,900
Forget it. He's in a good mood now.

162
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,330
I shouldn't reopen old wounds.

163
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,970
The Grandmaster's family had actually

164
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,420
been jointly imprisoned by the Eight Palaces.

165
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,020
Because of that, all of his clan perished in flames.

166
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,970
No wonder he wants revenge.

167
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,210
But isn't the poison incurable?

168
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,020
How did I survive?

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,610
Some of the flowers work as antidotes, remember?

170
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,690
So they don't contradict each other.

171
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,850
They cancel each other out.

172
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,570
Then how do you tell medicine from poison?

173
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,810
I'm from the Sima clan.

174
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,020
The poison has no effect on me.

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,610
Besides, the Spirit Fire can help me tell them apart.

176
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,300
Don't tell me you went so far as to use the Spirit Fire

177
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,260
just to save me.

178
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,060
Of course I didn't need the Spirit Fire for that.

179
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,090
I just needed to tell sweet from bitter.

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,380
Poison, again.

181
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,090
So you tasted the flowers to find medicine for me,

182
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,300
just like Shennong did?
[*a mythological Chinese ruler]

183
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,300
If I want to kill you,

184
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,690
no matter where you are,

185
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,810
you'll die.

186
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,810
If I don't want to kill you,

187
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,610
even if you're dead,

188
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,900
I can bring you back to life.

189
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,210
Very mighty of you.

190
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,420
By the way, boss,

191
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,140
during the three days I was unconscious,

192
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,020
did anyone come looking for me?

193
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,810
Who do you want to have come?

194
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,210
So, no one then.

195
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,610
This feels just like getting off a plane and finding

196
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,490
no new messages at all.

197
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,020
What?

198
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,940
Nothing.

199
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,420
Grandmaster,

200
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,020
look,

201
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,570
since you've already ended seclusion,

202
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,900
keeping me around serves no purpose.

203
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm just eating and living for free.

204
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,180
Why don't I go back to Serene Vale?

205
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,540
Is Serene Vale better than here?

206
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,180
If I say yes, he'll get mad again.

207
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,970
He just played Shennong for me.

208
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,570
It seems he sees me as a trusted aide now.

209
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,380
No way he'll let me leave anytime soon.

210
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,210
If you say yes,

211
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,540
I will kill you.

212
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,810
No, of course not.

213
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,450
May I take some leave then?

214
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,060
I want to go see Ruling.

215
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,730
You can't.

216
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,180
You don't even know her true background.

217
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,690
Forget it.

218
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,060
I'll just wait for a chance to sneak out with Mr. Snake

219
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,210
and see Ruling.

220
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,380
Grandmaster,

221
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,850
the Celestial Palace is still keeping up the old practice of death duels.

222
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,610
Today's match is about to begin.

223
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,300
The Eight Palaces' most valued disciples

224
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,610
have already arrived at the arena.

225
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,330
Sect Master Shi and the eight palace heads

226
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,090
will probably be there, too.

227
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,180
Grandmaster,

228
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,900
there's something I'd like to ask.

229
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,180
The Eight Palaces have made you

230
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,610
suffer for 500 years.

231
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,570
Why didn't you kill them all when you

232
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,660
emerged from seclusion?

233
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,570
What if they

234
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,970
join forces again to seal you?

235
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,090
If I kill them all,

236
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,330
who will deal with the mess in the Gengchen Celestial Palace?

237
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,940
Me?

238
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,850
You could support a new palace head loyal to you

239
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,020
to run the Celestial Palace.

240
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,420
Everyone is greedy.

241
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,180
Who would truly be loyal?

242
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,900
So, Grandmaster, are we going to let them off just like this?

243
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,810
They've done so many terrible things.

244
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,660
Of course not.

245
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,420
I want those who once harmed and humiliated me

246
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,940
to suffer in fear,

247
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,090
to watch the things they treasure most be destroyed,

248
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,060
and, only after enduring the despair of hell,

249
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,610
to finally die.

250
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,140
Is Shi Qianlv included as well?

251
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,380
Shi Qianlv...

252
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,730
Grandmaster,

253
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,330
your body is growing weaker by the day.

254
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,060
Please drink this soup.

255
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,450
It will help your wounds heal.

256
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,810
If I die,

257
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,850
their dream of using the Spirit Fire will be shattered.

258
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,780
Even if you're angry, you shouldn't

259
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,490
take it out on your own body.

260
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,900
Now, drink the soup.

261
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,330
Be good.

262
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,420
Grandmaster,

263
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,090
have a sip.

264
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,450
If you don't want it,

265
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,420
may I drink it?

266
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,330
What's in that soup?

267
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,970
The blood of the Sima clan.

268
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,690
Why do you make me drink it?

269
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,940
Does Shi Qianlv know what it is?

270
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,780
Yes.

271
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,020
Sect Master Shi wants your wounds to heal faster so you could

272
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,180
nourish the Fengshan Spirit...

273
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,970
You're evil, all of you!

274
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,730
The Eight Palaces are nothing but puppets.

275
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,140
Shi Qianlv is the truly interesting one.

276
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,970
From what I've seen, Shi Qianlv's cultivation

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,940
isn't even as high as the palace heads.

278
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,450
Since the palace heads have reached levels

279
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,090
where the Truth Spell no longer works on them,

280
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,490
why don't we start with Shi Qianlv?

281
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,060
Incompetence is just his disguise.

282
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,300
He must have countermeasures in place.

283
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,090
Do not alert him.

284
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,540
Let him throw himself into disorder

285
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,450
and reveal weaknesses on his own.

286
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,780
Where else can you find an employee dorm this comfortable?

287
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,090
The work environment is like a scenic resort.

288
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,690
I've got the looks.

289
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,940
If I did my hair nicely

290
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,900
and changed into a pretty outfit, I'd look even better.

291
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,730
They're so thoughtful.

292
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,570
Are all these for me?

293
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,450
There's room service, too?

294
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,180
These puppet servants are basically robots.

295
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,850
Their skin feels so real.

296
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,660
Can you also bring me some jewelry and shoes?

297
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,490
Is that a yes or no?

298
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,420
Now I understand what "a life as carefree as an immortal" really means.

299
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,050
Right now, everyone thinks I'm the boss's confidante.

300
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,620
He was so arrogant when he emerged from seclusion.

301
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,820
If I quit,

302
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,180
would everyone take their anger out on me?

303
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,420
Even though the Grandmaster sometimes seems

304
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,250
a bit mentally unstable,

305
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,140
he's been pretty good to me.

306
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,340
He's saved my life so many times.

307
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,730
Besides, I still need him to help with my pain.

308
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,770
I'd better not think about quitting for now.

309
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,970
Grandmaster,

310
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,580
what brings you here?

311
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,820
Come with me.

312
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,290
All right.

313
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,050
- Greetings, Grandmaster. - Greetings, Grandmaster.

314
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,180
Grandmaster,

315
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,380
what are we doing here?

316
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,340
You may begin.

317
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,420
So this is a martial arts contest in the cultivation world?

318
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,690
Let's put on a show for now

319
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,660
and stall for time.

320
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,340
All right.

321
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,690
We'll wait for the seniors to arrive.

322
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:15,900
Greetings, Grandmaster.

323
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,340
Grandmaster,

324
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,770
why are you in the mood to come and watch

325
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,660
the disciples' death duels today?

326
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,340
You call this half-hearted show a death duel?

327
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,450
Grandmaster,

328
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,210
allow me to explain.

329
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,420
Those two in the ring

330
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,820
are from the Heaven Palace

331
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,770
and the Sun Palace, respectively.

332
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,450
They are both excellent disciples carefully trained

333
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,530
by their respective palace masters.

334
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,620
Hurting either one would be unfortunate.

335
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,180
Could you, for the Shi family's sake,

336
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,970
let them off?

337
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,450
Let them off?

338
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,290
The purpose of a death duel is to push disciples to advance their cultivation

339
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,900
in life-and-death combat.

340
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,180
Have the Eight Palaces grown so arrogant

341
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,100
that they don't even follow the rules they themselves set?

342
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,940
Sect Master Shi, do you also approve of this?

343
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,420
The Celestial Palace has this kind of tradition?

344
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,620
You heard the Grandmaster.

345
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,820
Take the death duel seriously.

346
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,210
Do not hold back.

347
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,100
What did we do wrong?

348
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,690
We just wanted to spare each other as fellow disciples.

349
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,290
Exactly!

350
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,770
Wanton killing of the innocent

351
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,730
goes against morality.

352
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,820
We spar to

353
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,660
learn from each other and improve our cultivation.

354
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,420
Why must we fight to the death?

355
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,450
Exactly.

356
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,860
Aren't these the very rules the Eight Palaces

357
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,180
set themselves?

358
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,860
And now, they're calling the Grandmaster evil?

359
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,140
You say that I go against morality

360
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,180
and kill the innocent.

361
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,970
Then let me see just how much

362
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,450
your so-called morality

363
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,290
is really worth.

364
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,730
- What is that? - That looks like a Bloodseal Bloom.

365
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,010
Really?

366
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,860
Is that the legendary Bloodseal Bloom?

367
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,970
Disciples, any one of you here today

368
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,580
who can win 20 death duels

369
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,940
will earn one petal of the Fengshan Bloodseal Bloom.

370
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,820
Apologies in advance, Junior Brother.

371
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,250
Senior Brother, you...

372
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,660
He's offering a Bloodseal Bloom's petal.

373
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,010
It equals a millennium of cultivation.

374
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,490
Isn't that exactly what we train for?

375
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,490
I can't believe they're killing each other over a single petal.

376
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,420
And the eight palace heads are just standing by

377
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,290
without lifting a finger?

378
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,050
Have these disciples lost their minds?

379
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,450
It's just a contest.

380
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,620
Why are they slaughtering each other?

381
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,050
They were all so polite just a moment ago.

382
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,010
Under the skin, they have the hearts of wolves.

383
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,180
Now, they are just showing their true colors.

384
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,820
Sect Master Shi,

385
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,380
is the Grandmaster trying to kill all the talented disciples

386
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,250
we've worked so hard to train?

387
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,860
This is not entirely the Grandmaster's doing.

388
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,770
Those disciples were driven by their own greed.

389
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,050
Easy for you to say

390
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,770
when it's my disciples who died.

391
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,730
Master Ri,

392
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,050
calm yourself.

393
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,180
Who would have thought

394
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,660
that the little child from back then

395
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,620
would become what he is today?

396
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,860
I fear this death duel

397
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,860
is the Grandmaster's way

398
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,900
of giving everyone here a warning.

399
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,180
Sect Master Shi,

400
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,380
you are the head of the Eight Palaces

401
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,180
and the Grandmaster's confidant.

402
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,530
You must not let him

403
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,380
keep running wild like this.

404
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,420
Sect Master Shi,

405
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,210
we are all counting on you.

406
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,290
Very well,

407
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,010
you may rest assured.

408
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,380
I will do everything I can to keep him calm.

409
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,620
But he has just emerged from seclusion,

410
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,820
and his anger is still high.

411
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,420
As long as he doesn't go too far,

412
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,380
we should

413
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,210
turn a blind eye.

414
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,210
Say what you want to say.

415
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,620
Grandmaster,

416
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,340
that Bloodseal Bloom you took out today

417
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,250
seemed to be greatly sought-after.

418
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,900
But didn't you say

419
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,420
it only works if it's taken with your blood?

420
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,900
Without your blood, the person who takes it will explode.

421
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,140
None of those people

422
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,900
has drunk your blood,

423
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,820
so what use would it be to them even if they got it?

424
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,450
Not with my blood,

425
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,860
but with the blood of the Fengshan Clan.

426
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,770
But aren't you the only one left of the Fengshan Clan?

427
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,490
That's right.

428
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,340
When members

429
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,690
of the Sima family die, their bodies can't be preserved,

430
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,490
and only a bone pearl remains.

431
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,660
Do you know why?

432
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,690
Because the flesh and blood of the Sima clan

433
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,690
are a rare medicine that can improve cultivation.

434
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,900
In the past, the other families of the sect would divide them up.

435
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,820
Judging by how eager

436
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,530
those people were to seize the Bloodseal Bloom today,

437
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,380
every disciple there

438
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,620
has drunk the blood of my clan.

439
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,450
Can't take it?

440
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,770
This Demon Realm spy

441
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,660
is actually more upright than many in the Celestial Palace.

442
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,490
How strange.

443
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,180
Whatever. I don't care where she's from anyway.

444
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,010
What did we do wrong?

445
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,220
- We just wanted to spare each other. - Exactly! Wanton killing of the innocent

446
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,470
- goes against morality. - He's offering a Bloodseal Bloom's petal.

447
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,940
It equals a millennium of cultivation.

448
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,210
Isn't that exactly what we train for?

449
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,180
So the boss grew up

450
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,340
in such a dog-eat-dog environment.

451
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,820
No wonder he's full of hatred for this world.

452
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,210
As his trusted aide,

453
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,290
should I say something

454
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,730
to comfort him?

455
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,490
No...

456
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,290
Liao Tingyan...

457
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,770
As someone without ambition,

458
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,420
you've been lucky enough to get promoted

459
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,620
to this position.

460
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,860
Don't overestimate yourself, okay?

461
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,100
Boss, why are you here?

462
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,940
I see.

463
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,340
The Spirit Fire is getting to you again, isn't it?

464
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,860
What is it?

465
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,490
Do you still feel irritated?

466
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,290
Is the air conditioner broken today?

This is as strange as the boss

471
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,900
telling me to clock out first when he himself

472
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,730
is still working overtime.

473
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,100
I'll...

474
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,660

if you...

483
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,290

489
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,210
Well, considering how good the benefits of this job are,

490
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,970
I should make some concessions for the boss.

491
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,580
Sima Jiao

492
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,420
seems like a career-obsessed man with no interest in women.

493
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,140
If he wants to stay here, let him.

494
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,050
As expected,

495
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,530
she not only eases the burning pain from the Spirit Fire

496
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,290
but also somehow calms my anger.

497
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,860
Wake up.

498
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,860
Wake up.

499
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,180
Get up.

500
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,580
No more sleeping.

501
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,690
What is it,

502
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,290
dear boss?

503
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,290
Can't you consider a beauty's need for beauty sleep?

504
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:59,050
Lack of sleep causes dark circles.

505
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,660
How can you even fall asleep?

506
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,940
Why wouldn't I fall asleep?

507
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,490
Because I am here.

508
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,010
So?

509
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,140
In the entire Gengchen Celestial Palace,

510
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,900
anyone who has heard my name

511
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,900
fears me.

512
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,860
How can you sleep so soundly next to me?

513
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,770
My sleep quality is just too good.

514
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,250
I can't help it.

515
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,380
You are impossible to figure out.

516
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,340
Fine, since you're such a night owl,

517
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,380
I'll make sacrifices and keep you company.

518
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,180
A night owl?

519
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,340
It means someone like you

520
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,490
with an irregular schedule.

521
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,530
Where do you come up with all these strange phrases?

522
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,380
I guess I'm just quick-witted.

523
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,490
Father,

524
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,940
I heard Sima Jiao

525
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,620
made over 100 disciples fight in death duels,

526
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,100
and many favored disciples of the Eight Palaces died.

527
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,050
How did the palace heads take that?

528
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,940
Did they pressure you?

529
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,860
Of course they are displeased,

530
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,660
but they won't openly protest for now.

531
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,580
After all, no one wants to anger Sima Jiao.

532
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,660
Besides, Tian Wuya and I are working together.

533
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,660
As long as he doesn't come for us,

534
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,900
so what if the Grandmaster kills a few people?

535
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,250
If he were to wipe us all out,

536
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,340
he'd end up gravely injured, too.

537
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,580
There would be nothing in it for him.

538
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,770
Besides, the new palace heads have only just taken office.

539
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,140
The situation is still unstable.

540
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,530
At most, they hold some resentment.

541
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,210
I've already calmed them down.

542
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,420
Then, Father,

543
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,420
are we just

544
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,660
going to let Sima Jiao run wild like this?

545
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,140
If this goes on,

546
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,860
the Eight Palaces may slip from our control.

547
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,970
Sima Jiao was sealed for so long.

548
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,770
His resentment cannot be dispelled easily.

549
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,970
Of course he'd want to kill a few people

550
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,820
to vent his feelings.

551
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,140
Besides, it's just a few disciples who died.

552
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,490
If he wants to kill them, so be it.

553
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,010
Even though he is a madman now,

554
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,250
he will still listen

555
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,010
to a few things I say.

556
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,620
We just have to handle him with care.

557
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,380
Before our great plan is complete,

558
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,340
we must keep the Eight Palaces under control so they remain useful to us,

559
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,970
and we also need to prevent Sima Jiao

560
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,420
from acting too wildly.

561
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,900
[Star Hall]

562
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,490
Grandmaster,

563
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,050
the disciples of all the palaces have gathered at the arena.

564
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,530
They're asking when today's death duels will begin.

565
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,780
They are even willing to give up

566
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,740
their lives for the Bloodseal Bloom?

567
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,530
Shi Qianlv and the eight palace heads don't seem

568
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,490
to care about those disciples' lives

569
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,300
at all.

570
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,780
After the last round of death duels,

571
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,050
Shi Qianlv

572
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,170
merely offered a few words of comfort

573
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,780
and brushed the matter aside.

574
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,650
Seems like there's a mole among the palace heads.

575
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,780
A mole? Could it be Tian Wuya?

576
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,260
He's the only one who seems rather close to Shi Qianlv.

577
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,340
White Deer Cliff's spirit veins were supposed to be under the Shi family's care.

578
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,380
Looks like Shi Qianlv really has given him some benefits.

579
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,530
What?

580
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,740
No wonder his cultivation has been improving so quickly.

581
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,420
I've heard he's already reached the Unity Merge stage.

582
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,300
Shi Qianlv is absolutely shameless.

583
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,530
These spiritual veins aren't his to give away.

584
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,450
He's only a gatekeeper.

585
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,650
What right does he have to play generous?

586
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,570
Tian Wuya...

587
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,090
That name sounds familiar.

588
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,780
Father,

589
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,090
Sima Jiao's cultivation has been improving fast.

590
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,610
Will he be strong enough to break free from these chains one day?

591
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,340
Don't worry, Wuya.

592
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,940
The eight sealing nails have been

593
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,220
[Young Tian Wuya]
driven deep into his body.

594
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,130
Even if he breaks the chains one day,

595
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,780
he will never escape the suppression of the nails.

596
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,610
But what if

597
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,860
he cannot bear the pain

598
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,820
and kills himself?

599
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,420
His life is tied to the Spirit Fire.

600
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,010
If he dies,

601
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,650
won't the Celestial Palace's spiritual veins all die away?

602
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,940
Young Master Tian, you have a point.

603
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,170
What do you suggest?

604
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,900
I think

605
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,010
we should add another restriction on top of the seals.

606
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,820
What stage did you just say he was at?

607
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,900
Tian Wuya has just entered the Unity Merge stage.

608
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,570
Is there a banquet today?

609
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,090
Yes. Today, the Heaven Palace is holding a flower banquet

610
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,650
and has invited disciples from all the palaces.

611
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,220
It should be lively.

612
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,420
Good.

613
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,820
Then we will join the fun

614
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,300
and have a little game with Tian Wuya.

615
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,570
Great, Grandmaster. When will we leave?

616
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,170
Once Liao Tingyan wakes up.

617
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,780
Grandmaster, is this your way of showing concern for Tingyan?

618
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,450
Do you want her to sleep a bit longer?

619
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,570
Even you dare to speculate about my thoughts now?

620
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,090
Waking up naturally without an alarm feels amazing.

621
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:01,820
Wow.

622
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,820
Let's see. What pretty clothes have they sent me this time?

623
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,700
Mirror,

624
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,530
tell me, who's the most beautiful woman in the world?

625
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,300
It's Liao Tingyan!

626
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,300
Trying on outfits is so much fun!

627
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,090
Boss.

628
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:46,900
Let's go.

629
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,610
We just worked overtime yesterday.

630
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,490
Can I have a rest today?

631
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,530
What is overtime?

632
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,090
It's when you want an employee

633
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,010
to be available 24 hours a day, like now.

634
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,820
So you don't want to come with me?

635
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,780
It's not that I don't want to.

636
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,900
Why don't you want to?

637
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,450
I'm afraid I might see dead people.

638
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,650
A person from the Demon Domain is afraid of dead bodies?

639
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,050
If you don't come, I will kill you first.

640
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,780
Let me just change into something easier to move in.

641
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,220
Follow me.

642
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,380
At least let me change!

643
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,420
Oh, the smell of fruit.

644
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,610
Boss, where are we going?

645
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,220
