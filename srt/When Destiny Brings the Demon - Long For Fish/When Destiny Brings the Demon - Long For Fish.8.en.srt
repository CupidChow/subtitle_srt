[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,420
[Episode 8]
[It Turns Out that I'm A Player Who Cannot Remain Uninvolved]

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,250
Always thinking about romance,

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,370
no wonder your people

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,090
never make any cultivation progress.

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,580
True.

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,860
I've now mastered the art

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,890
of sweet-talking Grandmaster.

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,810
Since my cultivation has greatly increased,

29
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,780
does that mean I can do a Solus Par Agula now?

30
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,500
Why did you put a slab of water on your face?

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,370
It's a facial mask.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,970
When my power was weaker,

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,940
the mask kept falling off.

34
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,130
Now that I'm stronger,

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,810
it sticks on my face.

36
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,810
What's the point of this?

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,410
It moisturizes your skin.

38
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,530
Seems like doing a beauty treatment

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,370
is the most my power can achieve.

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,180
Senior Brother said this is good for bruises and wounds.

41
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,090
It might not be the right cure,

42
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,410
but I'm sure it can be used

43
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,370
as a band-aid.

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,250
I should go out before Grandmaster wakes up.

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,620
I'm sure it's fine as long as I stay in White Deer Cliff.

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,650
It's been 500 years.

47
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,810
This is the first time

48
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,900
I felt a moment of drowsiness.

49
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,020
Was it because of her?

50
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,860
Is he having another headache?

51
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,300
Seems like it hurts a lot.

52
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,060
He's not concerned about the wound on his hand

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,980
because his head hurts too much.

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,770
Perhaps the wound on his hand

55
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,570
is insignificant compared to his headache.

56
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,690
Tingyan.

57
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,770
Me?

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,180
On account of your faithful servitude,

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,980
I can grant you

60
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,210
a vacation.

61
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,570
Or do you desire...

62
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,500
Mr. Snake, do you need anything from me?

63
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,890
Tingyan, here you go.

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,180
Ruling told me to hand this letter to you.

65
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,370
So, you met up with Ruling behind my back?

66
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,620
What did she say?

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,370
She told me to join her in admiring the Scarlet Sky

68
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,660
at the hour of Mao.

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,690
According to her, it's a magnificent view.

70
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,690
What about me? Did she tell me to come along?

71
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,500
I don't think so. It states that I should meet her alone.

72
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,980
The sky now looks like it's around 6 o'clock.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,210
Should I depart now?

74
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,250
Mr. Snake, what's wrong?

75
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,500
Tingyan.

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,660
Ever since Ruling returned my snake heart to me,

77
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,860
for some reason,

78
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,130
oftentimes,

79
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,940
I would miss Ruling's aura.

80
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,300
I don't think Ruling did anything

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,100
to your snake heart.

82
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,010
She merely brought it with her.

83
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,210
At most, it had absorbed some of her scent.

84
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,010
If so, why did I obtain a human form, then?

85
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,250
I know now.

86
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,180
Your heart fell for her aura.

87
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,860
That's why you obtained a human form.

88
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,890
Tingyan, what should I do, then?

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,210
How should I make Ruling fall for me?

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,540
Mr. Snake, since you just obtained your human form,

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,330
you might not know this.

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,740
Relationships between humans

93
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,450
have to be nurtured patiently.

94
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,450
Why not take Ruling as your master?

95
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,740
This way, you can stay by her side,

96
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,940
just like how you would stay by Grandmaster's side.

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,500
You'll have a proper excuse to stay with her.

98
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,420
But I already have Grandmaster.

99
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,500
How can I make Ruling my master?

100
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,250
Grandmaster would never agree to it.

101
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,980
You two have a close relationship.

102
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,620
I'm sure he'll agree to it.

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,980
I'm just a spirit snake.

104
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,420
How can I put myself on the same pedestal as Grandmaster?

105
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,250
Don't worry.

106
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,810
Grandmaster is just bad at expressing his feelings.

107
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,810
You're still very important to him.

108
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,420
I'll make a move now.

109
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,210
I...

110
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,330
Grandmaster.

111
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,500
Has Liao Tingyan gone out?

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,450
Yes, she has.

113
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,940
For what purpose?

114
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,860
Grandmaster, she told me to tell you

115
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,330
that she has gone out to look for Ruling.

116
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,450
She's actually learned how to act first and report later, huh?

117
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,250
Who delivered her letter to Ye Ruling?

118
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,180
It was I.

119
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,010
What about the task I told you to complete?

120
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,620
Grandmaster,

121
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,330
from what I had observed,

122
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,180
it seemed like Yuan Che had no desires.

123
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,660
I don't think he has any weak spots.

124
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,940
However, he has a son named Yuan Shang.

125
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,500
I wonder if Yuan Shang is his weakness.

126
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,130
What else do you need?

127
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,060
I have another request.

128
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,330
I want to...

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,420
Speak.

130
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,570
I wish to make Ruling my master.

131
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,420
Grandmaster, please grant me your permission.

132
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,060
You've already taken on a human form.

133
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,810
You can make such calls yourself.

134
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,780
Do not bother me.

135
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,660
Grandmaster, is that a yes?

136
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,850
Thank you, Grandmaster.

137
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,940
Is this the Scarlet Sky?

138
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,850
It's so beautiful. It looks just like the aurora.

139
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,260
To commoners, this may be a beautiful view.

140
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,610
But to me,

141
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,450
it's a barrier that I can never get through.

142
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,970
Mother,

143
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,660
do we have to stay here for the rest of our lives?

[Yin Palace, Labor Camp]
After the Immortal-Demon War,

145

[Yin Palace, Labor Camp]

146
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,220
the Yin Palace captured us from the Demon Realm

147
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,570
and brought us here as slaves.

148
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,660
[Mrs. Ye, Young Ye Ruling]
We were bullied and humiliated.

149
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,260
Initially, I thought

150
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,970
[Young Ye Canglan]
the new leader, Yin Liunian, was kind.

151
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,420
I foolishly gave away my true heart.

152
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,450
I never expected you two

153
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,140
to still live in a desolate place like this

154
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,810
with me after being born.

155
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,180
Right now, Sima Jiao is the only surviving member of the Sima Clan.

156
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,060
Once he dies,

157
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,970
the Immortal-Demon Barrier will vanish.

158
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,660
By then, we can return to our hometown.

159
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,210
Mother,

160
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,420
is there no other way for us to return to our hometown?

The extreme-cold nature.

162
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,140
I heard that the Frost Fish of Demon Realm, which has the extreme-cold nature,

163
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,540
can take us across the barrier.

164
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,180
Actually, if we can get across the barrier and head to the Demon Realm,

165
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm sure the magnificent view we're seeing right now

166
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,730
will be improved considerably.

167
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,260
Are you saying that the best viewing spot is over there?

168
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,180
Can we head there, then?

169
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,020
Tingyan.

170
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,730
- You... - Ruling, be careful.

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,180
It felt like I was electrocuted. That hurts.

172
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,210
You're still concerned about me at this moment?

173

Tingyan.

174
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,730
Why were you hurt by the barrier?

175
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,420
Didn't you say

176
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,450
that your body has an extreme-cold nature?

177
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,940
Has it malfunctioned?

178
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,900
That's not true. What's with the question?

179
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,810
It's nothing.

180
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,850
It's my fault. I forgot to remind you.

181
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,300
After the Immortal-Demon War,

182
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,330
the Sima Clan set up this barrier with Spirit Fire

183
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,180
to prevent contact between the two realms.

184
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,380
Therefore, beings of the Celestial Realm and the Demon Realm

185
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,940
are unable to get across the barrier.

186
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,090
No wonder the reaction was so strong.

187
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,540
That hurts.

188
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,260
Are you injured?

189
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,660
Let me see.

190
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,570
Why isn't Tingyan's extreme-cold nature

191
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,570
reacting to the barrier?

192
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,260
Father, I found out that Yuan Shang

193
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,730
has been sneaking around White Deer Cliff recently.

194
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,970
White Deer Cliff? What is he doing there?

195
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,690
I think he was waiting for someone.

196
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,570
How dare he cause trouble

197
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,140
under Sima Jiao's nose?

198
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,730
Does he have a death wish?

199
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,660
What about this? If he dies in White Deer Cliff,

200
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,210
we can push the blame on Sima Jiao.

201
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,260
Xu.

202
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,300
You've indeed improved.

203
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,610
Continue to keep an eye on him.

204
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,380
Find an opportunity. Let Sima Jiao initiate contact.

205
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,090
After that, we'll go for the kill.

206
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,260
Understood.

207
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,690
Is there anything delicious here?

208
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,940
My goodness. It's here again.

209
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,540
Beside the Blue Lumina Blossoms, under White Deer Cliff, at the hour of Zi.

210
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,570
If you don't show up, your identity will be exposed.

211
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,660
And, you will die in three days.

212
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,210
Not only am I the chosen one,

213
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,330
but I also have another identity, huh?

214
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,660
Could it be that I'm the antagonist?

215
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,850
Although I don't know what I feel guilty about,

216
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,300
I do feel guilty for some reason.

217
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,330
Go and see him.

218
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,660
I waited so long for you!

219
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,570
It was difficult for me to deliver the letter there.

220
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,090
I contacted you time and time again,

221
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,090
yet you never came.

222
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,690
You didn't even reply to my letters.

223
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,940
It seems you've found someone better

224
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,780
and are ready to cut ties with me for good, huh?

225
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,450
Is this the kind of heated outburst

226
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,540
one gets when a couple turns into bitter exes?

227
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,060
It's just like a boyfriend finding out that his girlfriend has cheated on him.

228
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,900
She never answers his call or replies to his texts.

229
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,780
Now that they're finally meeting each other, his girlfriend is late.

230
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,610
He is complaining about that.

231
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,090
And now, they're getting ready to argue.

232
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,300
What's wrong? Are you too scared to say anything?

233
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,140
Sima Jiao might've followed me here to enjoy the show.

234
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,810
I have to mind my words.

235
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,180
It's already over between us.

236
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,900
Do not look for me again.

237
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,300
You're something else.

238
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,540
How dare you betray me?

239
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,450
But don't forget.

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,850
Your life is still in my hands.

241
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,060
How is it?

242
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,970
How did it feel when the Bone-Eroding Venom

243
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,420
acted up yesterday?

244
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,570
Oh my...

245
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,940
Another attack?

246
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,970
It hurts...

247
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,730
So, I had stomach aches

248
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,610
because of you, huh?

249
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,610
How can a man like you, whose love has turned to hate,

250
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,570
who uses strange poison

251
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,490
to control his partner,

252
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,660
be worthy enough to have a girlfriend?

253
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,210
Even that darned Sima Jiao is...

254
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,780
Even Sima Jiao is better than you.

255
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,660
Bring it on, then.

256
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,330
Today, I'll sever the host's ties on her behalf.

257
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,570
How dare you speak to me like that?

258
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,260
Are you not afraid of death?

259
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,450
Fine.

260
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,780
I shall grant you your wish.

261
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,260
What's going on? Why are you still fine?

262
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,850
Could it be that Sima Jiao had neutralized your poison?

263
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,210
That's impossible.

264
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,660
If he did do so,

265
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,570
he would've found out about your identity.

266
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,020
If so, he would've killed you.

267
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,540
What exactly is my identity?

268
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,850
I'm just an innocent girl who was deceived by my ex-boyfriend.

269
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,210
Everyone has lousy exes, you know?

270
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,450
You're still pretending to be ignorant, huh?

271
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,450
Have you forgotten about the task

272
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,060
I had assigned to you?

273
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,380
Why have you not killed him yet?

274
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,420
So, you don't wish to kill me?

275
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,300
I don't.

276
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,810
Why?

277
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,610
You're already in so much pain.

278
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,570
Why aren't you trying to kill me?

279
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,690
Now, I'm seriously wounded.

280
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,260
This is a good opportunity

281
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,570
for you to strike.

282
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,260
You've already reached the Soulshift stage.

283
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,260
How is it? Do you feel like killing me now?

284
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,850
No wonder. It wasn't that Sima Jiao was paranoid.

285
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,940
It's just that the host of my body

286
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,090
joined the Three Saints Mountain to assassinate him.

287
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,140
Why didn't he kill me when he knew about it long ago?

288
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,900
Grandmaster is valiant and magnanimous.

289
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,940
Why would he hold it against me for something as menial as this?

290
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,090
Fine. Sima Jiao may choose not to care about your identity.

291
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,730
What about the others at Gengchen Celestial Palace?

292
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,490
Do you think Sima Jiao will still defend you

293
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,260
if the sect master and the other palace heads

294
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,540
know about your identity?

295
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,210
Are you trying to threaten me here?

296
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,140
Stop obsessing about my identity.

297
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,610
Just save your breath.

298
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,380
I won't kill Sima Jiao for your sake.

299
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,140
Hey, you...

300
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,850
I still have your companion artifact with me!

301
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,620
Although I cannot control you now,

302
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,900
as long as I have it, I can...

303
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,730
I was just thinking about it.

304
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,140
How did it appear in my hand?

305
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,490
Continue. What'll happen as long as you have it?

306
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,900
I'll kill you!

307
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,860
You can't even defeat a Nascent Soul cultivator?

308
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,820
I did nothing just now.

309
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,620
Have I gotten this powerful?

310
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,900
You're just a lowly Qi Forge cultivator.

311
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,420
How did you become this powerful?

312
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,690
Right now, I'm a Soulshift cultivator.

313
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,050
A Soulshift cultivator?

314
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,970
If he planted a spy like her among my ranks,

315
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,140
I suppose he's a fool himself.

316
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,420
Sima Jiao actually went that far for your sake, huh?

317
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,420
Don't think that your identity will be kept a secret

318
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,340
after you kill me.

319
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,180
Hey, you started the fight.

320
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,140
Can you stop being dramatic?

321
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,340
I'm not trying to kill you here.

322
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,450
You! Stop right there!

323
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,290
Did you betray me

324
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,940
because you fell for Sima Jiao?

325
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,940
That's not true. I didn't. Don't spout nonsense.

326
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,820
It'll be bad if Sima Jiao is eavesdropping on us

327
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,690
and thinks that I fell for him.

328
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,420
What a joke. Even if you do fall for him...

329
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,290
Shut up!

330
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,340
You mustn't spout such nonsense.

331
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,250
You'll fall sick easily

332
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,490
if you dwell on such random thoughts all day long.

333
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,820
I suggest you go to a physician and get a prescription.

334
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,970
Try to rest and recuperate.

335
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,730
Don't let your imagination run wild.

336
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,290
If not, you'll get yourself in trouble.

337
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,900
That's all I have to say.

338
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,580
You...

339
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,050
Who are you?

340
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,290
I'm Yuan Shang.

341
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,770
So, you're the weak spot of the Yuan family.

342
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,900
You actually came knocking on my door yourself.

343
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,210
So, she hasn't returned yet?

344
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,100
That man said he could control me with this artifact.

345
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,340
I don't think it's working.

346
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,660
Grandmaster, you're still awake?

347
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,660
I'm so sleepy now.

348
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,180
You're already a Soulshift cultivator.

349
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,660
Do you still need to sleep?

350
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,450
I don't need it, but I want it.

351
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,250
It's just like how I don't need to eat,

352
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,180
but I want to eat.

353
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,730
You're indeed strange.

354
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,660
Did he tail me or not?

355
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,900
Grandmaster, have you heard everything?

356
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,140
If so, I suppose you know about my identity, then.

357
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,820
No one can hide anything from me.

358
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,970
But I don't even know about my own identity.

359
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,050
Tell me, then. What's my identity?

360
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,380
You're an assassin who's after my life.

361
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,180
Tell me. Should I kill you or not?

362
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,010
He would've killed me long ago if he wanted to.

363
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,770
Moreover, if he kills me now,

364
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,490
the blood he fed me yesterday would've gone to waste.

365
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,820
I don't think he's that dumb.

366
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,690
What's on your mind?

367
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,900
You touched the flowers, and you didn't wash your hands.

368
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,770
After that, you put it on my lips.

369
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,180
Should I kill you or not?

370
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,140
I don't think you should.

371
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,770
Why?

372
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,010
I've already switched to the righteous side.

373
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,690
Grandmaster, I'm on your side now.

374
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,860
Are you calling me the righteous side?

375
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,660
I mean, the dark side.

376
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,860
You do change your mind quickly, don't you?

377
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,770
You were useless.

378
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,770
You couldn't even defeat a Nascent Soul cultivator.

379
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,450
Were you the one who sent my ex-boyfriend flying?

380
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,450
What's an ex-boyfriend?

381
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,180
It's someone who shouldn't even exist,

382
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,940
and might as well be dead.

383
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,340
I suppose he deserves to die.

384
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,450
Grandmaster is so nice to me.

385
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,250
He fed me his blood,

386
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,730
and he taught my ex-boyfriend a lesson.

387
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,820
He's nice to me, but he doesn't want me to find out.

388
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,250
What a tsundere.

389
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,250
Since you think he deserves to die,

390
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,450
you should've followed your will and killed him.

391
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,690
You see, I reached the Soulshift stage not long ago.

392
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,340
I'm no match for you when it comes to killing.

393
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,490
You're born to kill.

394
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,900
You'll get used to it after some killing.

395
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,820
This...

396
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,660
Where are we going?

397
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,860
Of course we're going to kill.

398
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,180
I'm not going.

399
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,490
Get up.

400
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,770
I don't want to kill anyone.

401
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,100
What if I insist on making you kill?

402
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,380
You can kill me first.

403
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,530
Do you truly think that I won't kill you?

404
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,660
I think you won't.

405
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,050
Are you angry?

406
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,620
Grandmaster.

407
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,730
Grandmaster.

408
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,820
You see, this isn't my home.

409
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,210
It's not a place I'm familiar with.

410
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,010
And often, for no apparent reason,

411
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,860
people always try to kill me.

412
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,250
Luckily, you're here.

413
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,250
That's why I can live like a carefree bum

414
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,900
in such a harsh environment.

415
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,940
So when I say I'm grateful, I mean it.

416
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,340
I also mean it when I said I've switched sides.

417
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,380
Everything is negotiable as long as

418
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,420
you don't force me to kill.

419
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,100
Stop being angry, okay?

420
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,860
Test me with the Truth Spell if you don't believe me.

421
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,970
Why don't you test me?

422
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,620
Shut up.

423
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,970
Fine, then.

424
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,660
You must be one of Sect Master Shi's disciples.

425
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,420
Help me.

426
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,940
Father.

427
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,620
Have you accomplished the task?

428
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,660
Yes, I have.

429
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,860
Yuan Shang is dead.

430
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,940
Before his death,

431
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,770
Sima Jiao cast Soul Search on him.

432
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,490
There will surely be traces of his spell

433
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,660
inside his body.

434
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,290
We can say that Yuan Shang had a weak constitution

435
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,970
and that he died of physical and mental exhaustion

436
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,380
as he couldn't endure the harsh interrogation.

437
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,820
This way, Sima Jiao

438
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,450
won't suspect us.

439
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,380
It'll also cement his identity as the murderer.

440
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,300
Excellent.

441
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,250
I told you guys to keep an eye on Young Master!

442
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,820
How could you guys not know where he is?

443
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,450
Master, please be appeased.

444
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,770
I shall look for Young Master immediately.

445
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,210
Who's there?

446
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,940
Are you Grandmaster's personal bodyguard?

447
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,100
Why did you come here at this late hour?

448
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,140
Take a look.

449
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:35,970
Why...

450
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,900
Why are you guys still not willing to let me off?

451
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,490
How are you dumber than a snake like me?

452
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,210
Do you think you could've lived until now had Grandmaster not saved you?

453
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,490
What do you mean by this?

454
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,380
Are you saying that the Shi family was out to get me?

455
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,620
Isn't it obvious?

456
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,290
You left a spell inside my body

457
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,140
after you cast Soul Search on me.

458
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,140
So, you did it to save me.

459
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,770
What a useless fool. I wasted my spiritual energy on you.

460
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,380
So, you found out that I colluded with the Demon Realm

461
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,380
and planted Liao Tingyan by your side

462
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,140
so that she could kill you.

463
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,450
If so, why did you rescue me?

464
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,730
What's your goal?

465
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,970
And, Sect Master Shi,

466
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,180
why was he trying to kill me?

467
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,100
How did Yuan Che give birth to a fool like him?

468
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,860
You may insult me, but do not insult my father!

469
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,490
So noisy.

470
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,690
Take him to Yuan Che.

471
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,770
Spare his son if he knows what's good for him.

472
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,820
If not, kill them both.

473
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,450
Shang.

474
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,380
So, Sect Master Shi targeted my son and tried to push the blame on Grandmaster

475
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,900
so that I would seal Grandmaster away.

476
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,140
His sin is unpardonable.

477
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,450
Please thank Grandmaster for sparing him.

478
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,730
How will Grandmaster deal with Shi Qianlv?

479
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,340
You don't need to know what Grandmaster will do next.

480
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,770
You just need to complete the task Grandmaster has assigned to you.

481
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,860
Understood.

482
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,180
From now on, I'll surely follow Grandmaster's lead.

483
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,490
He wants you to pretend that you have no idea about Yuan Shang's encounter.

484
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,420
He wants you to serve Shi Qianlv

485
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,290
and acquire his trust.

486
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,900
Understood. I shall serve as Grandmaster's spy.

487
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,490
The moment something happens, I'll report it to him.

488
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,050
He said that there's no need to contact him.

489
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,380
You just need to act

490
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,140
according to Shi Qianlv's will.

491
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:36,820
Remember,

492
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,340
you must acquire his trust

493
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,290
so that we can use it to our advantage.

494
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,940
As for Yuan Shang,

495
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,490
Grandmaster said he could spare him.

496
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,250
But from now on, he shall be hidden from the world.

497
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,900
If you're unable to hide him from the world,

498
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,050
Grandmaster will kill him on your behalf

499
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,730
to prevent additional trouble.

500
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,490
I shall heed Grandmaster's guidance.

501
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,820
Please thank Grandmaster for saving my son.

502
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,690
Shang.

503
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,020
[Yin Palace]

504
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,380
Ruling.

505
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:24,730
Canglan.

506
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,010
You've finally returned. I'm glad that you're back.

507
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,500
[Ye Canglan, Disciple of Yin Palace]

508
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,290
It must've been tough on you.

509
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,340
Not at all.

510
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,690
Ruling, congratulations on absorbing the master's core.

511
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,580
Now, you can live here.

512
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,940
You won't need to be bullied again.

513
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,860
Here.

514
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,290
Ruling, was there no opportunity for you

515
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,420
to kill Sima Jiao

516
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,860
when you were at Three Saints Mountain?

517
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,490
He's too powerful. He's very cautious as well.

518
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,970
He only ordered Tingyan to serve him alone.

519
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,820
I couldn't get near him.

520
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,450
But Canglan, I discovered

521
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,100
that Tingyan might have the extreme-cold nature

522
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,730
that Mother had mentioned before.

523
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,380
The extreme-cold nature?

524
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,820
Only the Frost Fish in the Demon Realm

525
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,940
possesses the extreme-cold nature.

526
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,050
Could it be that Liao Tingyan is its incarnation?

527
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,180
This is great.

528
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,690
Besides the Sima Clan,

529
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,580
only those with the extreme-cold nature

530
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,210
can get across the Immortal-Demon Barrier.

531
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,940
But I've tried it before.

532
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,450
It's as if she forgot about her identity.

533
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,050
She couldn't remember how to activate her extreme-cold nature.

534
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,050
If so, we can just extract her core.

535
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,050
That won't do.

536
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,140
If we do so, she will not survive.

537
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,620
Tingyan has no idea who she is.

538
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:47,860
Canglan,

539
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,250
we cannot expect people to sacrifice themselves

540
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,290
for our sake.

541
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,250
If Sima Jiao finds out that she's from the Demon Realm,

542
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,970
he will kill her anyway.

543
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,770
If so, isn't it better for her to help us and our brethren

544
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,620
to return to the Demon Realm

545
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,970
and fulfill Mother's last wish?

546
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,250
That won't do.

547
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,180
Tingyan treats me as a true friend.

548
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,660
I mustn't betray her.

549
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,420
We stand a chance

550
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,730
of returning to our hometown as long as she's alive.

551
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,940
But Ruling,

552
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,620
compared to killing Sima Jiao,

553
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,860
extracting Liao Tingyan's core

554
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,100
is much easier.

555
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,490
Enough.

556
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,380
Do not bring this up again.

557
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,730
I'll come up with a way.

558
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,140
Excellent.

559
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,660
Tell Yuan Che that Liao Tingyan

560
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,770
is from the Demon Realm.

561
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,620
This way, he would think

562
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,340
that Sima Jiao killed his son because he was persuaded

563
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,770
by that woman from the Demon Realm to do so.

564
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,140
This way,

565
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,660
there's no way Sima Jiao can prove his innocence.

566
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,450
Yes, Sect Master.

567
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,380
Anxue.

568
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,940
You did an excellent job on

569
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,180
the previous Three Saints Mountain mission.

570
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,690
What reward do you want?

571
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,450
Now, Yin Liunian is dead.

572
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,970
The new palace head is incapable.

573
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,380
Sect Master, I only wish to serve you again.

574
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,420
I have no other requests.

575
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,730
All right.

576
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,450
Thank you, Sect Master.

577
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,140
You may leave.

578
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,340
Yes, Sect Master.

579
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,210
Zhenxu.

580
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,250
When do you intend to cast Soul Cleanse on Anxue?

581
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,620
Father, Soul Cleanse is an excruciating spell.

582
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,660
Anxue has no idea about our grand plans.

583
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,730
She has always been loyal to us as well.

584
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,420
Don't you think we can...

585
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,250
Zhenxu,

586
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,620
remember this.

587
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,490
There's no one in this world you can trust completely,

588
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,530
except for me.

589
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,860
Our plan

590
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,290
must be flawless.

591
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,940
Yes, Father.

592
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,180
Where's Liao Tingyan?

593
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,860
Tingyan is still sleeping.

594
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,690
She sleeps and eats all day long.

595
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,970
She does lead a carefree life, doesn't she?

596
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,250
Let me wake her up, then.

597
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,050
Don't be nosy.

598
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,820
Shi has already found out that Liao Tingyan is from the Demon Realm.

599
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,900
Grandmaster.

600
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,340
Shi Qianlv actually found out

601
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,530
Tingyan was from the Demon Realm.

602
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,660
What should we do now?

603
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,050
This is a secret.

604
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,940
How did that old fool find out?

605
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,380
Could it be that Shi Qianlv is still in cahoots with the Demon Realm?

606
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,450
Was that why he found out about Tingyan's identity?

607
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,010
Go investigate the source of the information.

608
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,820
Yes, Grandmaster.

609
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,490
But Grandmaster,

610
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,420
how should we deal with Tingyan's case now?

611
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,010
Since the Eight Palaces want her dead,

612
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,250
we shall oblige.

613
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,490
Grandmaster,

614
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,820
are you going to kill Tingyan?

615
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,450
What's wrong?

616
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,450
Are you reluctant to part with her?

617
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,420
That's right.

618
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,620
Grandmaster, I'm sure you feel the same.

619
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,140
I'll instruct Yuan Che to collude with Shi Qianlv,

620
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,180
kill Liao Tingyan,

621
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,050
and acquire Shi Qianlv's trust.

622
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,340
But Grandmaster...

623
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,090
Sect Master Shi.

624
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,650
Sect Master Shi!

625
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,650
Sect Master Shi.

626
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,450
Master Yuan.

627
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,340
Please uphold justice for Four Seasons Palace!

628
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,940
Master Yuan, what happened?

629
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,650
Today...

630
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,450
Today, I found Shang's body

631
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,570
under White Deer Cliff.

632
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,490
His body actually contained traces of Sima Jiao's spell!

633
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,700
How could that be?

634
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,220
Master Yuan.

635
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,220
Please accept my condolences.

636
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,220
But why did Grandmaster do that?

637
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,860
I also found out about this just now.

638
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,220
Liao Tingyan is actually a spy from the Demon Realm.

639
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,170
I assume she tried to silence him

640
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,970
after my son found out about her identity.

641
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,940
Therefore, she instigated Sima Jiao

642
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,420
to murder my son!

643
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,260
Grandmaster has so much trust in that traitor.

644
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,820
If this keeps up, Gengchen Celestial Palace

645
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,650
will face a crisis.

646
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,490
I will never let him off!

647
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,700
Before this, I still had some respect for him.

648
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,450
I didn't expect him to treat our lives

649
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,860
with such indifference!

650
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,340
He does things in a reckless, outrageous way.

651
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,530
I have to get my revenge!

652
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,570
Grandmaster.

653
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,570
You're here.

654
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,780
You've actually come to read for once.

655
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,740
Ever since I reached the Soulshift stage,

656
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,170
my sense for the world got stronger and stronger.

657
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,970
Now, I'm curious about the structure of the cultivation world.

658
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,530
I was bored as well.

659
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,380
That's why I started reading.

660
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,050
What books have you read, then?

661
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,010
I've read...

662
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,740
I was just having a casual look.

663
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,740
Let go.

664
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,610
Can you promise me that you won't be angry at me, then?

665
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,170
No, I cannot.

666
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
[Legends of Gengchen Celestial Palace]

667
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,490
You see? I knew that you would be angry at me.

668
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,010
This is nothing more than something fabricated

669
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,650
by the people of Gengchen Celestial Palace.

670
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,260
If so, Grandmaster, why don't you tell me the real deal?

671
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,780
It says here that Gengchen Celestial Palace

672
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,610
isn't limited to just the places we see now.

673
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,940
There are outer sects around it,

674
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,220
with spaces for both cultivators

675
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,700
and demonic cultivators.

676
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,650
Is that true?

677
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,260
That's true.

678
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,610
Many years ago, the leader of the Demon Realm, Centipede, caused chaos.

679
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,530
The Sima Clan eradicated the demonic cultivators

680
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,340
and set up a Immortal-Demon Barrier.

681
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,970
Since then, those from the Demon Realm couldn't cultivate their powers

682
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,780
with the spiritual energy of Gengchen Celestial Palace.

683
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,010
Is the Sima Clan that amazing?

684
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,700
It's said that the war was so brutal,

685
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,420
the battlefield stretched red and barren for miles.

686
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,010
The former hills and mountains have become barren plains.

687
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,970
It even says

688
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,740
that you were raised by Lord of Slack of the Shi Clan.

689
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,940
It says that you were rash and you wouldn't take his advice.

690
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,900
He sought the help of an immortal

691
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,940
to suppress your inner demon.

692
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,820
It says that your nickname, Lord of Mercy,

693
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,570
came from...

694
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,380
That's totally false.

695
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,050
This book is complete nonsense.

696
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,700
Boss, this book is too much.

697
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,260
Even I don't believe it.

698
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,130
I'm telling the truth.

699
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,010
Sect Master Shi.

700
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,050
Please reactivate the sealing array.

701
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,260
From now on, I'll surely follow your lead.

702
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,610
Master Yuan, you honor me too much.

703
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,090
Grandmaster is too stubborn and unyielding.

704
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,380
We should persuade him

705
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,450
to get back on the right track.

706
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,340
Now, the new palace head of Heaven Palace has already assumed office.

707
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,610
Seems like there's no issue

708
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,300
in sealing him away again.

709
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,340
However,

710
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,300
Master Yuan, what you said before did make a lot of sense.

711
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,450
Once we reactivate the sealing array,

712
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,170
each palace will surely receive casualties.

713
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,570
If so...

714
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,650
If so, what should we do?

715
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,940
Suggest to him that he should use Liao Tingyan's identity

716
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,050
to his advantage and find a chance to seal me away.

717
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,940
Shi Qianlv will surely be pleased upon hearing that.

718
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,490
Since Sima Jiao

719
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,300
favors that spy that much,

720
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,970
let's use her to lure Sima Jiao into the sealing array.

721
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,530
Even if we fail to seal him away,

722
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,300
we can keep Sima Jiao in check

723
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,260
as long as we capture Liao Tingyan.

724
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,090
During the flower banquet,

725
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,340
it seems to me

726
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,650
as if Dongyang Zhenren is her master.

727
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,050
We can use him to our advantage.

728
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,420
Master Yuan, that's an excellent plan.

729
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,420
All right. There's no time better than now.

730
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,420
I shall summon all palace heads

731
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,380
to discuss this matter and make the call together.

732
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,130
Thank you, Sect Master Shi.

733
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,900
Dear Tingyan, it's been some time since we met.

734
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,450
I missed you.

735
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,650
It's from my master.

736
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,940
A festival is about to arrive in Serene Vale.

737
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,450
As it happens, you've already left the sect with Grandmaster.

738
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,650
Your fellow disciples are inviting you and Grandmaster to our celebratory feast.

739
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,490
This is great.

740
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,010
Grandmaster, let's attend it together.

741
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,780
I'm not going.

742
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,530
May I attend it, then?

743
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,340
Of course.

744
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,050
This celebratory feast was meant for you.

745
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,900
It's meant to kill you.
