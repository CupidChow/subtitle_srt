00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,220
Whenever I want, I will change.

191
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,500
But you're now a dead person.

192
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,020
So you should still appear as an otter

193
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,340
in front of others.

194
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,860
All right.

195
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,220
Huan.

196
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,420
By the looks of it,

197
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,500
Mr. Yan

198
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,620
is indeed an irresponsible jerk.

199
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,260
What exactly does "jerk" mean?

200
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,100
A man who abandons his wife and child

201
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,180
and should be pounded into pulp.

202
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,620
Perhaps he will be.

203
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,340
What do you mean?

204
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,060
Smashed into pieces

205
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,660
and ground into dust.

206
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,740
I have a feeling Grandmaster's cooking up something big.

207
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,020
[Yan Residence]

208
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,780
Mr. Yan has returned!

209
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,980
- Quick! - Quick!

210
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,780
Mr. Yan.

211
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,020
You...

212
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,660
Who are you?

213
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,540
Why did you transform into me?

214
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,540
Because there's something about you that interests me.

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,100
What do you want?

216
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,100
Are you going to catch me back there again?

217
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,700
Someone! Father!

218
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,940
Have you forgotten, Mr. Yan?

219
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,260
Your father went to the neighboring city on important business.

220
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,460
He won't return for a month.

221
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,620
All right.

222
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,940
Get lost.

223
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,050
Yes, sir.

224
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:31,900
You!

225
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,540
Who are you people?

226
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,540
Never ever try to fight against Grandmaster.

227
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,220
Just give up, jerk.

228
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,060
The flame-shaped birthmark on your back,

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,700
where did it come from?

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,020
I don't know.

231
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,300
I honestly don't know.

232
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,020
Speak.

233
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,300
I don't want to go back there.

234
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,740
I don't want them to go there either.

235
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,100
It's so frightening. So disgusting.

236
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,420
Grandmaster,

237
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,740
he seems to have PTSD

238
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,820
about that birthmark.

239
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,780
What?

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,700
Just hearing about the birthmark

241
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,060
triggers his traumatized memory

242
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,820
and drives him into madness.

243
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,340
Not even the Truth Spell works on him.

244
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,580
Mr. Yan,

245
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,020
the Master asks that you rest at the sixth concubine's quarters tonight.

246
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,980
You're not going anywhere from now on.

247
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,820
Stay home and give me heirs.

248
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,660
That son of the Yan family takes concubine after concubine,

249
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,100
yet never studies for the imperial exams.

250
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,300
He spends his days drinking in brothels.

251
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,580
There's no difference between him and keeping worthless trash.

252
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,860
Well,

253
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,500
you're just jealous

254
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,380
he was born with a silver spoon.

255
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,540
If this keeps going on,

256
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,980
he'll wind up down and out.

257
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,860
I can't get anything out of him.

258
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,540
The Soul Search can't help either.

259
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,740
Looks like the memory traumatized him badly.

260
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,900
He's a good-for-nothing.

261
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,180
Patience.

262
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,740
We'll see if

263
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,540
we can find clues elsewhere.

264
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,070
Don't worry.

265
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,620
We can kill a few people in this residence,

266
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,700
and they'll tell us the truth.

267
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,700
That won't do, Grandmaster.

268
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,460
We still have much to find out.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,660
Besides, you're wearing this jerk's face,

270
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
you have to tread carefully.

271
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,940
A little impatience will spoil our plan.

272
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Goodness!

273
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,860
This frigging Mr. Low-Stamina

274
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,420
has enough wives for a football team.

275
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,060
Mr. Yan.

276
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,420
Mr. Yan,

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,100
you haven't visited me in so long.

278
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,740
Mr. Yan, when will I get to see Xian?

279
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,860
I've barely seen him

280
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,300
since he was born.

281
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,020
- Right. - Mr. Yan.

282
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,740
Let go.

283
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,170
- Mr. Yan. - Mr. Yan.

284
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,300
Could you turn me back into human form, Grandmaster?

285
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,380
I need to go out.

286
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,940
Why?

287
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,060
I bet Ms. Qing'er still has no idea

288
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,540
Mr. Yan has taken a dozen concubines.

289
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,580
I must tell her

290
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,220
so she'll give up on him.

291
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,820
Weren't you the one who always slacked off?

292
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,620
Why take trouble now?

293
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,660
I'm not lazy.

294
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,060
I'm just relaxed.

295
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,860
The point is,

296
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,980
those concubines

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,820
are such a pain.

298
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,780
It's worse if Ms. Qing'er keeps coming to you.

299
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,980
I should handle this trouble for you.

300
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,340
Fine, then.

301
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,460
Go on.

302
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,860
If Zhou Qing'er

303
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,780
has any clues about the flame-shaped birthmark,

304
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,500
report back to me.

305
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,140
He's a workaholic.

306
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,940
All right.

307
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,620
That's a compliment.

308
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,500
How much for this embroidery?

309
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,460
Five wen.

310
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,780
And the white one?

311
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,740
Show us the white one.

312
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,900
That's also five wen.

313
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,220
Same price?

314
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,820
I think the red one is prettier.

315
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,860
Thank you.

316
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,300
Ms. Qing'er.

317
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,060
You're Huan's new concubine, aren't you?

318
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,860
I saw you in his carriage.

319
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,820
I have nothing to do with Mr. Yan.

320
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,180
I came because I saw

321
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,220
how he treated you the other day.

322
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,300
I thought it was unfair.

323
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,940
He has taken too many concubines now.

324
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,760
Just days ago, he took another.

325
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,380
Heed my advice,

326
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,700
leave

327
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,140
that faithless scoundrel.

328
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,820
You don't know.

329
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,620
Huan isn't the kind of man you say.

330
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,260
When we first met,

331
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,700
we sincerely

332
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,620
liked each other.

333
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,370
Which one do you like? Tell me.

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,530
Cui.

335
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,500
Do you like this one?

336
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,400
Jeez.

337
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,850
The good ones are inside.

338
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,780
Ms. Qing'er, you're fooled by him.

339
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,850
Why still

340
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,380
hang on to someone like him?

341
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,780
I took some silver

342
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,980
from Yan Huan.

343
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,300
Take your child and start over somewhere else.

344
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,980
Did Huan give you this

345
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,980
to pass to me?

346
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,500
No. He...

347
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,060
Yes, you can think of it this way.

348
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,860
Miss,

349
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,420
I won't take this money.

350
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,700
I can stop seeking him out.

351
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,540
But

352
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,140
if he won't explain to me in person,

353
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,340
I'll never leave.

354
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,580
Wake up, Ms. Qing'er.

355
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,020
Huan once wrote me poems.

356
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,540
"We entrust our affection to the clear moon.

357
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,380
Let the breeze carry you away forever."

358
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,460
We also recited poems together

359
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,500
and played the guqin on a boat.

360
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,420
I don't believe this.

361
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,620
I don't believe everything just ends up like this

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,860
without reason.

363
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,260
Don't cry.

364
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,540
- There... - Ms. Qing'er, I just want to ask.

365
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,900
Do you know

366
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,060
the flame-shaped birthmark on Yan Huan's back?

367
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,340
I do.

368
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,100
Has he ever told you

369
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,460
about that?

370
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,020
Never.

371
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,540
All right.

372
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,220
- Don't cry. - That birthmark is indeed a hard secret to dig.

373
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,420
There...

374
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,940
Your face tells me

375
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,260
things didn't go well.

376
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,580
I spoke with Ms. Qing'er.

377
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,620
She knows Yan Huan has a flame-shaped birthmark,

378
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,660
but she has no idea what it means.

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,340
Then we have to find clues elsewhere.

380
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,180
And Ms. Qing'er is a hopeless romantic.

381
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,380
No matter how I try to warn her,

382
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,100
she refuses to believe that Yan has failed her.

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,940
What is "hopeless romantic"?

384
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,580
It's an illness in which one

385
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,900
only cares about romance and nothing else.

386
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,460
Do you suffer from this illness?

387
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,780
Me?

388
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,460
Of course not.

389
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,300
I can barely manage my own affairs.

390
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,020
Good.

391
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,500
Love is the most useless thing in this world.

392
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,300
You can't put it that way.

393
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,340
A true and beautiful relationship can give people great strength.

394
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,540
Only people with poor cultivation

395
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,500
would think so.

396
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,660
Considering the environment he grew up in,

397
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,420
it's normal that he doesn't believe in love.

398
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,420
Not resting yet?

399
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,850
I know otters are cute,

400
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,790
but it doesn't have to appear so often.

401
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,790
I'd like to stroll the market tomorrow.

402
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,560
Can you turn me back into human form?

403
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,020
You chatter too much.

404
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,620
I'm trying to rest.

405
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,740
Grandmaster,

406
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,140
please.

407
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,380
Don't fall asleep yet, Grandmaster.

408
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,900
Not again.

409
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,940
Care to buy a body pillow?

410
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,380
It's cheap.

411
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,780
I already have one here.

412
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,260
Why would I need another?

413
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,380
The soul-tracking firefly

414
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,060
[Yan Residence]
shows me that Nianjiu's last trace

415
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,980
is at Yan Residence.

416
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,280
Sima Jiao and Tingyan must be here too.

417
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,710
Let's go shopping.

418
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,060
It's Ruling!

419
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,980
Miss,

420
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,460
has a young lady entered your household lately?

421
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,420
Do you mean

422
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,420
Mr. Yan's new concubine?

423
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,220
Concubine?

424
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,660
No.

425
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,700
The one I'm looking for

426
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,660
is about this tall.

427
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,660
She's slender and beautiful.

428
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,100
Ruling must be here for me.

429
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,060
No, I haven't seen her.

430
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,540
Thank you.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,620
Ruling.

432
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,820
Ruling.

433
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,100
Where did this little spirit come from?

434
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,100
Don't get in my way.

435
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,420
Wait for me, Ruling!

436
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,500
Nianjiu was clearly

437
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,020
last found here.

438
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,940
Could it be...

439
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,140
Could it be that Tingyan's already...

440
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,460
You little spirit.

441
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,620
Why is it you again?

442
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,220
[I'm Tingyan]

443
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,660
What does that mean?

444
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,580
I'm Tingyan.

445
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,260
Tingyan?

446
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,180
It can't be.

447
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,580
On Stargazing Terrace,

448
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,500
Tingyan gave me fruits,

449
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,940
and we enjoyed the view.

450
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,700
You really are Tingyan?

451
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,340
Tingyan!

452
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,100
Oh, finally, my friend.

453
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,820
I understand now.

454
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,860
Grandmaster is trying to protect you this way

455
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,610
so you can avoid trouble from the Eight Palaces.

456
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,960
But it truly frightened me

457
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,350
when I saw your life lamp go out.

458
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,780
It's always good to have friends.

459
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,940
Ruling.

460
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,180
Ruling, it's really you.

461
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,540
What brings you here?

462
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,620
I came seeking Tingyan,

463
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,980
so I happened to stop by here

464
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,580
and found her.

465
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,100
You found Tingyan?

466
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,660
Where's she?

467
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,460
You don't know yet?

468
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,980
No.

469
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,100
Don't worry.

470
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,580
She's safe now.

471
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,420
That's a relief.

472
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,620
Looks like you two are tight.

473
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,900
Grandmaster.

474
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,580
I told Liao Tingyan to keep this secret

475
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,740
from everyone.

476
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,980
She trusts you so much.

477
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,380
Forgive me, Grandmaster.

478
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,420
I worry for Tingyan

479
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,860
and came looking for her.

480
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,260
Tingyan couldn't bear to see me upset,

481
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,180
so she told me.

482
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,860
If you say a word about her whereabouts...

483
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,700
Please don't worry, Grandmaster.

484
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,820
I will keep it to myself.

485
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,020
Grandmaster, Ruling,

486
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,060
you know where Tingyan is,

487
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,780
why won't you tell me?

488
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,700
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

489
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,100
Why don't you ask yourself?

490
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,980
Ask myself?

491
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:54,920
Say,

492
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,740
Ruling,

493
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,680
now that we meet again,

494
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,950
are you ready to begin the lesson?

495
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,960
Lesson?

496
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,700
Have you forgotten? You promised to teach me how to behave like a human.

497
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,700
No, I haven't.

498
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,540
So, in the first lesson,

499
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,020
you've just taken human form

500
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,940
and still carry your beastly nature.

501
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,700
Though it can be brutal,

502
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,460
it also makes you lower your guard

503
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,620
and obey unconditionally.

504
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,820
You're too sincere and kind.

505
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,220
That won't do you any good.

506
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,220
What should I do?

507
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,060
Ruling.

508
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,260
Teach me, please.

509
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,540
Miss,

510
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,540
we have great tube whistles.

511
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,500
Come have a look.

512
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,300
Which one do you like?

513
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,220
Come have a look.

514
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,740
You have keen eyes, miss.

515
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,660
This tube whistle has an excellent tone.

516
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,540
How much?

517
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,100
Only 100 gems.

518
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,660
100 gems.

519
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,220
Yes.

520
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,620
Wait.

521
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,740
I can tell

522
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,940
this tube whistle

523
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,860
was bought in bulk from South Mountain.

524
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,900
It's worth no more than ten gems.

525
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,940
Ten gems.

526
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:13,980
Miss,

527
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,820
you should take this one instead.

528
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,420
Ten gems for you.

529
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,860
Ten it is.

530
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,540
No.

531
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,340
I'll lose money.

532
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,900
No way.

533
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,140
Wait.

534
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,860
You can have this for ten gems.

535
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,100
All yours.

536
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,940
There you go.

537
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,340
Master,

538
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,980
this is my gift as a disciple.

539
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,900
The sound of this whistle travels a hundred li.

540
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,340
If I call for you with it,

541
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,020
you'll hear me even from afar.

542
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,900
All right.

543
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,500
If you need me,

544
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,260
I can appear by your side anytime.

545
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,660
Thank you, Nianjiu.

546
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,180
You see,

547
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,540
human minds are complicated.

548
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,500
Full of traps.

549
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,780
If you ever come across a situation

550
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,660
like the whistle peddler,

551
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,100
never agree so easily like you did just now.

552
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,820
Understood?

553
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,060
How should I refuse them?

554
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,980
I'll teach you.

555
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,460
You can refuse politely

556
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,620
by saying,

557
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,540
"This doesn't look right."

558
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,780
This doesn't look right.

559
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,860
If the other person insists,

560
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,380
you say,

561
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,540
"I don't have the time."

562
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,020
I don't have the time.

563
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,460
If they still insist,

564
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,940
you can be more direct

565
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,340
and give a firm refusal.

566
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,740
"No, I can't."

567
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,380
Oh, I see.

568
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,060
It's the same when Grandmaster usually says

569
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,780
"Get lost", right?

570
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,340
Yes, but

571
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,740
that's the ultimate form of rejection.

572
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,820
This doesn't look right.

573
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,140
I don't have the time.

574
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,420
No, I can't.

575
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,220
Get lost.

576
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,180
I think I've got the hang of it.

577
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,460
I didn't teach you the last one.

578
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,620
This doesn't look right.

579
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,820
No, I can't.

580
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,140
I don't have the time.

581
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,100
[Yan Residence]

582
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,620
[Zhou Yueqing]

583
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,480
You're indeed a jerk.

584
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,140
You haven't even settled things with Ms. Qing'er,

585
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,300
and now you're messing with Zhou Yueqing.

586
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,780
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

587
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,620
Yueqing.

588
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,540
Yueqing.

589
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,060
Yueqing.

590
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,260
Yueqing.

591
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,940
Hold on.

592
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,860
Our daughter was born last month.

593
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,180
This poor child doesn't have a name yet.

594
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,380
Will you give her a name?

595
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,100
Huan once wrote me poems.

596
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,620
"We entrust our affection to the clear moon.

597
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,540
Let the breeze carry you away forever."

598
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,980
Clear moon, breeze, Zhou.

599
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,980
My, my! This name is...

600
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,220
Yueqing.
[*Moon and breeze]

601
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:16,820
Grandmaster,

602
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,540
I think I've discovered something important.

603
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,460
What's it?

604
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,780
Yan Huan

605
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,580
really likes Ms. Qing'er.

606
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,300
You rushed here

607
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,140
just to tell me

608
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,620
Yan Huan's love story?

609
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,060
I just saw him

610
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,860
giving Ms. Qing'er's child a name.

611
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,180
Even if he truly likes her,

612
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,980
so what?

613
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,060
Grandmaster,

614
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,140
think about it.

615
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,140
For someone like Yan Huan,

616
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,740
who bluffs and flirts a lot,

617
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,780
if he really liked her,

618
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,060
why wouldn't he marry Ms. Qing'er?

619
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,180
Why would he go to such lengths

620
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,460
to cut ties with her?

621
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,180
Perhaps he has his own reasons,

622
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,180
and it might have something to do with the flame-shaped birthmark.

623
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,220
Mr. Yan!

624
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,100
Mr. Yan,

625
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,860
the twelfth concubine threw herself into the well!

626
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,740
What?

627
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,460
Luckily,

628
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,980
she was saved.

629
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,420
Take me to her.

630
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,660
Mr. Yan, she's here.

631
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,140
My Xian!

632
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,540
Mr. Yan!

633
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,100
Mr. Yan,

634
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,220
please let me see my son.

635
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,940
Mr. Yan,

636
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,940
if I weren't desperate to see my son,

637
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,340
I wouldn't have risked my life, Mr. Yan.

638
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,980
I'm begging you.

639
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,180
Please.

640
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,620
Please let me see him.

641
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,500
Mr. Yan, I miss my child too.

642
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,580
Mr. Yan.

643
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,180
Where's her son?

644
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,580
I don't know, sir.

645
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,820
The Master and you

646
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,820
never allow us to ask about the children.

647
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,820
It seems like

648
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,420
something's wrong with this Master Yan.

649
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,580
Oh, right, Grandmaster.

650
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,860
We've overlooked something.

651
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,060
With so many concubines in the Yan Residence,

652
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,460
there's no child here at all.

653
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm begging you, Mr. Yan.

654
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,220
There's still one person who has a Yan child.

655
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,940
Ms. Qing'er.

656
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,620
I saw Ms. Qing'er here last time.

657
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,220
She said she lives nearby.

658
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,780
Huan!

659
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,540
- What's wrong, Ms. Qing'er? - Some...

660
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,060
Someone took our child away.

661
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,820
When did this happen?

662
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,380
Just now.

663
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,980
I was playing with the child in the courtyard.

664
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,900
Then, I went inside to get her a pellet drum.

665
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,260
But when I returned,

666
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,140
the child was gone.

667
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,980
What should we do?

668
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,340
I'll find her.

669
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,140
But the streets are full of people.

670
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,620
We don't know where the culprit went.

671
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,700
How do we find the baby?

672
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,300
Follow this light stream.

673
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,940
We should be able to find the baby.

674
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,260
This way.

675
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,060
You!

676
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,820
Return the child.

677
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,540
Get out of my way.

678
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,580
Move!

679
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,300
The baby!

680
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,300
Mr. Yan?

681
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,420
As expected of you, Grandmaster.

682
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,420
Why are you stealing someone else's child?

683
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,820
Do you know you'd be sentenced to death

684
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,060
if you stole a kid in my world?

685
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,180
Why are you taking this child?

686
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,380
I'm bringing her back to the household

687
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,740
and will hand her over to Master Yan when he returns.

688
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,900
You're from the Yan Residence?

689
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,660
And what happens after giving the child to Master Yan?

690
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,940
I don't know.

691
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,820
The Master only told me to watch

692
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,820
if Mr. Yan had any children outside.

693
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,700
If he did,

694
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,140
bring the child back.

695
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,340
That's why I was watching Zhou Qing'er.

696
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,300
I'm clueless about the rest.

697
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,340
Where's Master Yan?

698
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,380
He said he went to the neighboring city on some matters.

699
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,460
No one knows where he is.

700
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,420
As expected.

701
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,500
This child has a flame-shaped birthmark.

702
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,100
Could it be

703
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,260
that all of Mr. Yan's children

704
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,780
have a flame-shaped birthmark,

705
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,540
and for some reason, the Yan family

706
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,620
took them away?

707
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,900
Perhaps because these children are of great use,

708
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,380
the Yan family made Yan Huan marry many concubines

709
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,060
and forced him to have children.

710
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,100
This sounds exactly like...

711
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,940
It's exactly the same as what the Eight Palaces did.

712
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,100
To feed the Spirit Fire,

713
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,660
they first forced Grandmaster's parents together

714
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,620
and then plotted to obtain his blood.

715
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,260
The Celestial Palace is indeed boring.

716
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,660
They always use the same trick.

717
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,580
Nothing new.

718
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,580
My child!

719
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,620
Thank you, miss.

720
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,500
Thank you, sir.

721
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,060
Who took my child?

722
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,180
Was it a human trafficker?

723
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,180
It's someone from the Yan family.

724
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,060
Yan family?

725
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,980
Why is that?

726
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,300
We don't know.

727
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,020
Ms. Qing'er,

728
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,980
last time I asked you about the flame-shaped birthmark,

729
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,940
why didn't you tell me

730
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,100
your daughter had it too?

731
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,540
Do you know anything about it?

732
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,860
I truly didn't know.

733
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,340
I wasn't trying to hide it either.

734
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:27,820
Huan...

735
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,460
I asked Huan before

736
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,060
about the flame-shaped birthmark,

737
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,540
and he suddenly became agitated,

738
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,940
as if it were an ill omen.

739
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,220
When I later gave birth to my daughter,

740
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,180
she also had the same mark.

741
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,060
I knew Huan wouldn't like it,

742
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,340
so when you asked,

743
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,860
I pretended I didn't know.

744
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,060
Looks like we could only get the answer from Master Yan

745
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,900
to find the truth.

746
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,460
Grandmaster,

747
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,120
tell her

748
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,800
the daughter's name is Yueqing.

749
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,820
Me?

750
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,980
I'm here, baby girl.

751
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,300
I've come up with a name for her.

752
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,780
Yueqing.

753
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,620
Zhou Yueqing.

754
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,780
Yueqing...

755
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,220
"We entrust our affection to the clear moon.

756
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,860
Let the breeze carry you away forever."

757
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,540
It's from a poem Huan wrote for me.

758
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,300
I suppose

759
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,980
he still cares for me.

760
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,640
Yueqing, this is the name your father gave you.

761
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,070
Do you like it?

762
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,300
Yes?

763
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,180
E,

764
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,580
give our child a name.

765
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,660
Let him be called Jiao.

766
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,860
So what

767
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,540
if she has a name?

768
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,220
Even with a name,

769
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,820
she still will

770
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,460
bring disaster.

771
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,540
Grandmaster,

772
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,460
don't say such frightening things.

773
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,300
No matter what dangers lie ahead,

774
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,260
Yueqing has a mother who loves her the most.

775
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,580
I won't

776
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,580
let her face the world alone.

777
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,540
Sir, miss,

778
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,900
although I don't know your true identities,

779
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,180
thank you so much.

780
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,980
You can tell he's not Yan Huan?

781
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,900
You broke my illusion trick?

782
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,940
I know nothing about spells.

783
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,340
But I spent so much time with Huan before,

784
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,020
and I'm familiar with his every move.

785
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,980
I wasn't sure at first,

786
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,380
but over time,

787
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,140
and after you cast a spell to locate the baby,

788
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,860
I knew you weren't him.

789
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,370
Grandmaster,

790
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,810
true love can break spells.

791
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,780
In that case, she can break the Yan family's fate

792
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,780
with true love.

793
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,220
He didn't mean that.

794
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,220
We'll continue looking into the Yan family.

795
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,380
Thank you, miss.

796
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,020
Thank you, miss.

797
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,460
Thank you, miss.

798
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,580
Thank you, sir.

799
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,260
Grandmaster,

800
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,750
so,

801
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,900
does the Yan family have a blood relation

802
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,460
with you?

803
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,780
Otherwise, why would all this happen?

804
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,700
Yes. I suspected there was some relation

805
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,260
between the flame-shaped birthmark and the Fengshan line.

806
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,820
Just when I entered the town,

807
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,340
I located Yan Huan using blood resonance.

808
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,420
For over five hundred years,

809
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,500
I'm the only one left of the Sima Clan.

810
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,660
I didn't know the blood

811
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,460
could sense each other.

812
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,580
That's why

813
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,020
I used blood resonance

814
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,500
to find the child.

815
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,260
But

816
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,980
why is there

817
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,140
Fengshan bloodline here?

818
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,660
The Fengshan Clan

819
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,940
has always pursued bloodline purity.

820
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,780
But over the years,

821
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,940
some have

822
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,780
defied their elders, run off,

823
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,060
and had children with outsiders.

824
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,420
Shi Qianlv

825
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,820
has gone to great lengths to gather people of the Fengshan bloodline.

826
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,340
He is playing a long game.
