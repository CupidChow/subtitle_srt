If you want a master to teach you how to live,

187
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,140
I can find another for you.

188
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,660
From now on,

189
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,490
you are my only master, Grandmaster.

190
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,660
Nianjiu,

191
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,810
I've heard Fenghua City is quite lively.

192
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,690
Why don't we go out and explore together?

193
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,780
Sure.

194
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,690
I need to take you somewhere first.

195
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,730
Then I guess you'll have to go by yourself.

196
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,490
I'll wait.

197
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,690
Did news of the new Spirit Fire come in?

198
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,690
No.

199
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,450
But someone is going to take me to it.

200
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,380
Who?

201
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,210
Shi Qianlv.

202
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,420
"Act as planned"?

203
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,260
Guards.

204
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,260
Master Yuan.

205
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,020
I will be away for a while.

206
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,140
You must watch the Young Master closely.

207
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,690
Understood.

208
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,690
Young Master?

209
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,850
I will go kill that wicked Shi Qianlv myself!

210
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,540
Madam Shi.

211
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,970
Pick me, please.

212
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,060
Madam Shi, pick me.

213
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,300
- Pick me, Madam. - Please choose me, Madam.

214
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,880
- Look at me. - Pick me, Madam.

215
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,140
- Look at me. - Madam...

216
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,210
Give me a chance, Madam.

217
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,460
- Look here, Madam. - Pick me.

218
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,640
Please choose me, Madam.

219
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,260
Pick me, Madam.

220
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,780
- Choose me, Madam. - Pick me, Madam.

221
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,380
Grandmaster,

222
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,810
why did you bring me to Shi Yuxiang's treasure vault?

223
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,490
You never used magical artifacts before.

224
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,780
Why are you suddenly interested?

225
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,730
What is this for?

226
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,940
Defense.

227
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,090
Don't tell me these are all for me.

228
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,940
I'll pass on this nose ring.

229
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,660
If I really put it on,

230
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,300
my beautiful nose would fall right off.

231
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,420
This is a nose ring?

232
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,060
It's so big that it looks like it's meant for cattle.

233
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,380
I don't want it.

234
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,850
I think it's fine.

235
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,020
I don't. No, thanks.

236
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,450
Are these really all for me?

237
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,180
Of course.

238
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,970
But I don't like them.

239
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,940
Forget it, all right?

240
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,940
I can already hear you cursing me in your heart.

241
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,660
My temper has been really bad lately.

242
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,580
I'm warning you, don't mess with me.

243
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,380
What about this one?

244
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,420
Do you like it?

245
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,420
Yes, I do! This one's pretty.

246
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,490
Too bad it isn't a defensive artifact.

247
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,180
What's wrong with you?

248
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,380
Do you really have feelings for me?

249
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,290
What's this?

250
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,490
Pills. They don't taste bad.

251
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,770
They calm the mind.

252
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,380
Wow, I feel so happy.

253
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,250
Greetings, Madam Shi.

254
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,660
Greetings, Madam Shi.

255
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,050
- Madam. - Madam.

256
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,900
Back off! Leave me alone!

257
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,690
Please choose me, Madam Shi.

258
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,530
Pick me, Madam.

259
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:38,970
Madam...

260
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,100
Don't you see I have one already?

261
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,140
I'm not putting on any of those.

262
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,820
Are you kidding me?

263
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,690
Sima Jiao, you're hundreds of years old,

264
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,010
yet you're as childish as a kid!

265
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,860
Why is it suddenly thundering?

266
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,820
Even the weather is in a foul mood.

267
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,340
[A spiritual peak of the Shi family]

268
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,580
Who goes there?

269
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,900
How dare you damage our spiritual peak?

270
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,420
Father, another spiritual peak has been destroyed.

271
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,970
Who did it?

272
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,530
Someone at quite a high realm. Our disciples couldn't catch him.

273
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,970
But the spells he used

274
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,900
carried traces of Sima Jiao's spiritual power.

275
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,050
So Sima Jiao was behind it?

276
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,250
He's searching for our Spirit Fire?

277
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,770
Yes, and that's what worries me.

278
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,420
By the way, Father,

279
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,620
about the spy you told me to investigate,

280
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,580
after looking deeper,

281
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,100
I discovered someone who should have already been dead.

282
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,100
Who?

283
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,620
Yuan Shang.

284
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,860
Yuan Shang?

285
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,450
He's not dead?

286
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,820
No.

287
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,290
If Yuan Shang is still alive,

288
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,180
then in the failed siege at the Luo River Immortal District,

289
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,490
the traitor

290
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,970
wasn't Ye Ruling.

291
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,860
Are you saying you suspect Yuan Che?

292
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,380
Sima Jiao knew

293
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,490
we were going after Yuan Shang,

294
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,100
so he deliberately set a trap for us

295
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,450
to win Yuan Che over and use him.

296
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,660
Father, then we can also use Yuan Shang

297
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,770
to turn Yuan Che into our spy.

298
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,900
Ever since the Baifeng Mountain fire, Sima Jiao

299
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,490
has been gravely weakened

300
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,290
and has become everyone's target.

301
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,100
And yet

302
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,140
Yuan Che still follows him so loyally.

303
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,250
This man is useless to us.

304
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,010
Then should we just kill him?

305
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,820
All you know is killing.

306
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,530
And yet you even failed

307
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,820
to kill Yuan Shang!

308
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,730
No need to kill him.

309
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,450
Sima Jiao's whereabouts are elusive.

310
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,860
I've been fretting over how to track him down.

311
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,140
Perhaps

312
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,380
this is just the opportunity I need.

313
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,730
It really is a bit heavy.

314
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,770
Grandmaster, Yuan Che has sent a message.

315
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,010
Look.

316
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,770
The plan is underway. Please await further news.

317
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,690
Shi Qianlv is about to take the bait.

318
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,420
Grandmaster, are you making artifacts for Tingyan?

319
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,940
I heard thunder outside.

320
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,580
Is Tingyan about to undergo tribulation?

321
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,730
You've gotten smarter.

322
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,820
So you brought her to Fenghua City

323
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,450
because of the tribulation artifacts

324
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,660
and the Thunder Valley,

325
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,860
which can help her survive, right?

326
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,200
But Tingyan's tribulation should only be

327
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,970
36 thunderbolts.

328
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,380
With her cultivation and your support,

329
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,010
she'll survive them easily.

330
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,210
Why are you going to such trouble?

331
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,820
Because I will not be with her.

332
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,860
Why not?

333
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,580
The way of heaven has always been against the Sima clan.

334
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,580
If I stay by her side, she'll only be in greater danger.

335
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,250
Isn't this a storage artifact?

336
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,620
How did it turn into a defensive one?

337
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,180
Did you make this yourself?

338
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,970
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

339
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,450
Just how many layers of defensive seals are there?

340
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,900
Have you finished counting?

341
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,620
Forget it.

342
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,140
There are so many. I won't need all of them.

343
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,250
There will always be times like last time

344
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,490
when I am not by your side.

345
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,820
After thinking it through,

346
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,290
I decided a defensive artifact is the best way

347
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,100
to keep you unharmed in the face of danger.

348
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,450
I won't be in danger anytime soon.

349
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,530
You will be needing it very soon.

350
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,180
Why?

351
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,450
Why do you always leave things unsaid?

352
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,580
Now I can't even sleep.

353
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,820
Sima Jiao...

354
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,050
I haven't done anything bad.

355
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,450
Why do I feel so uneasy?

356
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Jiao, something's off about the thunder.

357
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,380
Jiao!

358
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,250
I really feel uneasy.

359
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,380
I've never felt this way during a thunderstorm before.

360
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,730
You are about to break through to the Void Forge stage,

361
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,690
so there will be a thunder tribulation.

362
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,770
No wonder I've been so restless lately.

363
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,490
So you gave me this defensive artifact because you were worried

364
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,450
I'd be struck to death by lightning.

365
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,010
Am I going to be the first

366
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,180
Soulshift cultivator to be killed by lightning?

367
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,570
As long as I don't let you die, you won't die.

368
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,260
All right. I know you're mighty.

369
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,820
But maybe you should keep your distance for now.

370
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,820
I'm not ready to face the thunder tribulation yet.

371
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,080
Stop touching me!

372
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,420
You...!

373
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,660
You're going to face it now.

374
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,300
[Thunder Valley]

375
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,180
We're here.

376
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,580
All right.

377
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,010
Do you know why I chose Shi Yuxiang?

378
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,660
Because you wanted to be my boy toy?

379
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,770
She is also a Soulshift cultivator

380
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,420
close to a breakthrough.

381
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,490
What a coincidence.

382
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,010
But what does that have to do with me?

383
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,210
Thunder Valley

384
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,100
once belonged to the Sima clan

385
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,250
and could help with tribulation.

386
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,380
But now,

387
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,620
only the Shi clan can enjoy this privilege.

388
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,340
So this is the protective shield you found for me?

389
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,730
Go inside yourself.

390
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,580
He's really sending me in alone?

391
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,490
I was trained

392
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,010
by exam-oriented education.

393
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,250
The best thing it gave me was psychological endurance.

394
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,340
Relax.

395
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,490
With my aptitude and spiritual roots,

396
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,620
the tribulation for going from Soulshift to Void Forge

397
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,250
should only be 36 thunderbolts.

398
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,820
Thunder Valley can weaken the strikes.

399
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,820
And I have Jiao's overpowered defensive artifact

400
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,820
and my own cultivation to shield me.

401
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,660
It's just 36 bolts of lightning.

402
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,690
Piece of cake.

403
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,580
Already starting?

404
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,420
It's like the thunder

405
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,380
wants to blast me into dust.

406
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,380
I'm not facing 36 thunderbolts.

407
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,820
I'm facing 81 thunderbolts!

408
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,900
Isn't that supposed to happen

409
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,940
only when a Grand Ascend cultivator

410
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,940
is about to become immortal?

411
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,420
Why would I, a Soulshift cultivator, be facing this?

412
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,340
This isn't a tribulation.

413
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,100
This is a death sentence.

414
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,100
Am I really going to be the first

415
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,380
Soulshift cultivator to be killed by lightning?

416
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,050
If I get blasted to pieces here,

417
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,900
Jiao will never forgive himself.

418
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,250
I should probably put up a fight.

419
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,940
Sit still.

420
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,580

Didn't I tell you to sit still?

Why didn't you listen?

456
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,970
Sima Jiao, my heart is racing.

457
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,650
I don't know if it's because the thunder tribulation was too terrifying

458
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,450
and I'm still shaken,

459
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,050
or if it's because you are taking my breath away right now.

460
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,260
Is it impossible to have a moment of romance with you?

461
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,300
All that noise just now...

462
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,900
Won't it draw attention?

463
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,450
A thunder tribulation here

464
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,530
doesn't cause any visions outside.

465
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,340
If I take proper care of it,

466
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,860
even if the wound heals slowly,

467
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,170
it should be fully recovered in ten days.

468
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,490
You prepared this especially for me?

469
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,610
Of course.

470
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,570
You're my pretty boy, aren't you?

471
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,490
I don't want bandages. They're troublesome.

472
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,340
Stop.

473
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,380
I just applied medicine.

474
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,450
If it's not wrapped, the wound will split open easily.

475
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,300
Just for one day.

476
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,530
That's it, okay?

477
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,300
Once it closes up a little, we'll take the bandages off.

478
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,860
Please. I'm really worried about you.

479
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,050
Just keep them on.

480
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,940
I've put on the Yingluo necklace you gave me.

481
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,490
I've prepared these especially for you.

482
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,970
If you don't use them, my efforts will all go to waste.

483
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,420
Please?

484
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,900
Do you think I can't tell you're playing cute?

485
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,090
So what if you can tell?

486
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,340
You're still enjoying it, aren't you?

487
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,900
If it were anyone else

488
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,010
who was at such a high realm, such a wound

489
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,900
would heal quickly after a few pills.

490
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,090
But not for Sima Jiao.

491
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,050
Don't worry.

492
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,860
I won't die before you do.

493
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,340
Sima Jiao,

494
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,740
do you know you carry a faint scent

495
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,300
of the Bloodseal Bloom?

496
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,380
It's like it seeps out from your blood.

497
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,170
Is that so?

498
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,090
Am I

499
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,420
the only one in the world who can smell your scent?

500
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,050
You went out of your way to bring me here

501
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,450
and made

502
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,220
such a powerful defensive artifact for me.

503
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,570
Did you foresee that this tribulation

504
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,650
wouldn't be so simple?

505
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,700
Yes.

506
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,610
Because you carry

507
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,820
my aura.

508
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,340
The way of heaven rejects the Sima clan.

509
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,130
It wants me dead.

510
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,050
It is my aura clinging to you

511
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,170
that caused you to go through 81 thunderbolts.

512
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,700
I had planned to stay far from you

513
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,970
during your tribulation

514
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,090
so that you could maybe have it easier.

515
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,650
But unfortunately,

516
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,820
heaven wouldn't even spare my aura.

517
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,820
How vicious heaven is,

518
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,780
targeting your whole clan.

519
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,300
Are you scared

520
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,090
I might bring you down with me?

521
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,610
Of course not.

522
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,170
But thunder tribulation is such a hassle.

523
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,650
I'd rather not advance my cultivation too quickly.
