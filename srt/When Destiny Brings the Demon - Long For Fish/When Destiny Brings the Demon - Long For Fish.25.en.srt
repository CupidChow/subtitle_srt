[When Destiny Brings The Demon]

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
[Based on the JJWXC novel "When Destiny Brings The Demon" by Fu Hua]

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,500
[Episode 25]
[Traveling Together Is the Perfect Chance to Grow Closer]

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,410
Isn't this the cold pond?

23
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,500
The water temperature is just right.

24
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,620
It's been so long since I felt like I was on vacation.

25
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,940
Wait, I can travel with my spirit sense now?

26
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,740
Looks like those pills really worked.

27
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,060
Always so vain.

28
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,500
I'll tease you about it later.

29
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,500
Why can't I get through?

30
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,020
It's dangerous there.

31
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,210
The Demon Realm is more perilous than the Celestial Palace,

32
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,010
so I set a protective barrier for your spirit sense.

33
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,370
Why did it feel strangely familiar?

34
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,540
Of course.

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,250
Back then, to purge the demonic poison,

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,060
you drank my blood

37
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,130
and took a Bloodseal Bloom.

38
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,890
That pushed you into Soulshift,

39
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,500
and your spirit sense wandered just like this.

40
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,620
I once stumbled into my Soul Manor

41
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,940
and found your Bloodseal Bloom there.

42
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,370
Why?

43
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,180
Did that frighten you?

44
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,210
Do you know what that means?

45
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,740
I am not frightened.

46
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,540
Don't forget:

47
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,890
when you are agitated,

48
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,130
I can sometimes hear what is on your mind.

49
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,740
Right now, you are telling yourself

50
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,100
to stay calm

51
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,980
and not panic.

52
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,690
Perhaps you can feel it:

53
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,860
even when you distance yourself from me,

54
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,860
even when you resent me,

55
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,420
you still instinctively draw close to me

56
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,300
and rely on me.

57
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,420
That's because

58
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,980
a flower of mine

59
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,860
is still blooming in your Soul Manor.

60
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,770
What...

61
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,250
What were we like with each other?

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,570
Just like that.

63
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,620
Like what?

64
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,540
Like what you are thinking.

65
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,540
I am not thinking about anything.

66
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,420
Have we...

67
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,130
already?

68
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,890
What?

69
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,940
You know what I mean.

70
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,330
I don't.

71
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,450
Have you been to my Soul Manor?

72
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,300
Very often.

73
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,890
What's happening? I'm actually picturing it in my head.

74
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,570
No, stop it.

75
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,450
He can probably hear my thoughts.

76
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,010
But I have lost all of my memories.

77
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,690
Surely you have ways

78
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,420
to help me recover them, don't you?

79
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,250
So why haven't you done it?

80
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,370
Wouldn't that get you what you want

81
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,450
much faster?

82
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,570
True.

83

let it go.

109
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,300
Besides, she seems

110
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,450
to have forgotten all her memories as the Frost Fish,

111
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,020
which is why she can't recognize you.

112
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,810
What a pity

113
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,690
you two have ended up like this.

114
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,690

115
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,780
and lost all my past memories.

116

According to Sima Jiao,

117
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,940
before the memory loss, I was his cultivation partner.

118
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,570
She and I are cultivation partners.

119
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,730
You

120
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,210
are nothing more than a clown.

121
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,900
Yan, it was you who saved me.

122
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,850
Now, it is you who has forgotten me.

123
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,970
The Preceptor gave me the chance to keep living,

124
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,610
but you are the reason I want to stay alive.

125
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,900
The one you should remember

126
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,660
is me.

127
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,020
Mr. Feng, what brings you here?

128
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,020
Mr. Ghost, please send word that I wish

129
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,210
to meet with the Preceptor.

130
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,780
Greetings, Preceptor.

131
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,730
It's been years.

132
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,210
You have grown into such a fine figure.

133
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,490
My lord, please return. Leave the rest to me.

134
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,970
No need. A single fire will take care of it.

135
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,850
They brought it on themselves, outshining the master and knowing no restraint.

136
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,060
Preceptor...

137
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,380
This is as far as I can help you.

138
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,610
The rest

139
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,970
depends on your own fate.

140
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,180
Rise.

141
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,210
Preceptor, I will never forget that you saved my life.

142
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,690
Think nothing of it.

143
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,180
I hear you are willing to cooperate with us

144
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,450
to help that Frost Fish recover her memory?

145
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,900
Yes.

146
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,180
May I ask, Preceptor,

147
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,900
why you are so intent on helping me restore Yan's memory?

148
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,690
We want her to return to her former role,

149
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,940
kill Sima Jiao, and take his blood

150
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,380
to complete the blood sacrifice for the former Demon Lord, You Yan.

151
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,090
Blood sacrifice?

152
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,730
To continue their strength and rule,

153
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,020
the ancestors of the Demon Race would have

154
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,850
their souls extracted by the Preceptor after death

155
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,780
and infused into the bodies of their descendants.

156
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,300
The entire ritual

157
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,690
must be carried out in the blood pool at White Bone Abyss,

158
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,020
so it's called a blood sacrifice.

159
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,690
The former Demon Lord, You Yan, was killed by the Spirit Fire,

160
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,140
so even after all this time,

161
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,490
he still hasn't returned to life.

162
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,420
The blood in the pool has dried up.

163
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,180
To restore his soul as soon as possible,

164
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,140
we need the world's most nourishing blood,

165
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,660
the blood of the Fengshan Clan,

166
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,810
to refill the pool.

167
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,570
So you want to kill Sima Jiao and take his blood?

168
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,140
Exactly. And we need

169
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,420
not only

170
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,540
a body of You clan descent to serve

171
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,210
as the vessel for the Demon Lord's soul,

172
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,490
but also someone of the Chang family to initiate the ritual.

173
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,090
Mr. Feng, will you

174
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,900
lend us your aid?

175
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,940
It was You Chi who wiped out my clan.

176
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,420
As a descendant of the Chang family,

177
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,060
I have never wavered in my loyalty

178
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,610
to the Demon Race.

179
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,970
I am glad

180
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,210
you are willing to help.

181
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,020
Even the slightest mistake

182
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,060
could make centuries of planning all go to waste.

183
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,090
Still, I never imagined

184
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,180
you'd be so deeply attached to that little Frost Fish.

185
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,780
Preceptor, you gave me the chance to survive.

186
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,690
But it was Yan

187
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,060
who gave me the hope and courage to keep living.

188
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,900
I thought

189
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,660
I would never see her again in this life,

190
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,300
but then we met

191
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,850
once more in Celestial Crane City.

192
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,260
That

193
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,730
made me certain it was fate.

194
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,610
Tell me what I need to do next,

195
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,450
Preceptor.

196
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,810
Sima Jiao,

197
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,060
do you think more Spirit Fires are always better?

198
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,300
Your body can barely withstand them.

199
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,970
Why merge with so many?

200
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,570
Even if two Spirit Fires can greatly boost

201
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,420
your cultivation,

202
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,420
your body weakens

203
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,420
as your techniques advance.

204
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,020
Shut up.

205
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,570
You don't understand.

206
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,450
Slow-healing wounds are the least of your worries.

207
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,330
If you suffer a grave injury again,

208
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,940
it could cost you your life.

209
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,970
Who in this world could possibly hurt me?

210
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,450
Stop posturing, will you?

211
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,780
I'm warning you:

212
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,780
if you want to keep living peacefully,

213
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,620
sharing sweet days with the woman you love,

214
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,210
stop overusing your Spirit Fire techniques.

215
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,450
I don't want to perish with you.

216
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,620
Don't tell her about the two Spirit Fires.

217
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,250
Yan, someone is here for you.

218
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,380
He just won't give up.

219
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,420
I ran into him at the door when I returned from the market.

220
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,490
He said he wanted to see you.

221
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,730
My name is Heng Lin. Greetings, Grandmistress.

222
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,660
Aren't you the one from the black market

223
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,250
who knew where Grain Rain Vale was?

224
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,970
What brings you here?

225
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,530
I heard you had come to Winter City, so I came to seek you out.

226
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,770
Forgive my abrupt visit. I am here to invite you to Grain Rain Vale.

227
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,820
I can't go now.

228
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,820
I haven't saved enough for the trip.

229
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,940
Yan, the secluded place you mentioned

230
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,690
was Grain Rain Vale?

231
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,940
Yes.

232
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,940
Earlier, I failed to recognize your exalted identity.

233
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,420
I didn't know you were the Lord of Mercy's cultivation partner,

234
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,900
so I asked for 2,000 demon stones

235
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,290
as usual.

236
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,860
Your master, Dongyang Zhenren, has also settled at Grain Rain Vale.

237
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,940
When he learned you were in the Demon Realm,

238
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,620
he sent me to invite you.

239
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,340
Dongyang Zhenren? He's my master?

240
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,900
That's right.

241
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,490
Greetings, Grandmaster.

242
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,730
How was my relationship

243
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,100
with this Zhenren?

244
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,490
He bore you no ill will.

245
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,940
Grandmaster, Grandmistress,

246
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,580
if you come to Grain Rain Vale,

247
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,420
it will be our great honor.

248
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,380
We can go on vacation!

249
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,660
Wonderful.

250
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,450
And I get to bask in the Grandmistress's glory.

251
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,380
Of course, I will go with you.

252
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,140
[Grain Rain Vale, Demon Realm]

253
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,620
Follow me.

254
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,900
Look at those people.

255
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,940
Elsewhere, everyone tries

256
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,100
to appear glamorous,

257
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,580
but here, they simply enjoy themselves.

258
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,180
What a perfect place for seclusion.

259
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,690
Heng Lin, you're back.

260
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,210
And with so many guests.

261
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,730
I'm back.

262
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,290
They are our honored guests.

263
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,530
Welcome...

264
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,580
This way, everyone.

265
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,290
Come and play here.

266
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,530
Look.

267
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Slow down.

268
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,200
I want to play too.

269
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,530
The flowers here are beautiful.

270
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,730
They are.

271
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,450
Lin!

272
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,340
- You've grown so tall. What about you? - Lin!

273
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:29,970
Come on.

274
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,900
- You've grown too. Let's go this way. - Come!

275
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,720
- What did you bring us... - Here, look.

276
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,730
- Lin? - I brought you something tasty.

277
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,530
What is it?

278
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,100
- I want some. - There's enough for everyone.

279
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,250
- Who wants some? - I want some too!

280
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,420
Look at Feng Qi, fitting in so naturally.

281
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,690
See?

282
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,900
He isn't intimidated by your Grandmaster at all.

283
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,530
Ever since Feng Qi arrived at Grain Rain Vale,

284
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,820
he has been trying to impress Tingyan.

285
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,970
Grandmaster, let's just get her out of here.

286
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,730
This is exactly the wrong time to leave.

287
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,140
Walking out now

288
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,490
would only look like conceding to Feng Qi.

289
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,970
You are clueless. Stop making bad suggestions.

290
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,250
Noisy.

291
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,010
- Here. - Here. Let's play together.

292
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,970
- Delicious? - Yes!

293
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,530
So yummy!

294
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,180
- Go on and eat. - Slow down. There's plenty.

295
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,580
- Let me try yours. - Here.

296
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,850
- Here you go. - Here's some more.

297
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,420
Don't drop it.

298
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,250
Tingyan?

299
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,250
You can have this one.

300
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,050
I want this one.

301
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,340
Take it slow.

302
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,660
It really is you.

303
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,140
You are my master, right?

304
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,860
Only 18 short years have passed,

305
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,380
and you have already forgotten me?

306
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,340
I am sorry. Something happened to me,

307
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,690
and I lost all my memories.

308
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,100
Junior Sister Liao, have you forgotten me as well?

309
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,530
Come and help me.

310
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,380
Say something.

311
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,820
I was so moved to see Tingyan again

312
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,580
after so long

313
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,940
that I failed to notice you had arrived as well, Grandmaster.

314
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,180
Apologies for the late welcome.

315
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,100
My disciples and I got separated back then,

316
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,690
and I fled here with Changqing.

317
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,010
I never thought I would live to see you again, Grandmaster.

318
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,580
Dongyang, what's going on?

319
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,770
Masters,

320
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,180
I've brought the Lord of Mercy and his cultivation partner.

321
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,730
Greetings, Lord of Mercy!

322
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,290
Who is the Lord of Mercy?

323
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,730
I don't know either.

324
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,530
Lord of Mercy, you have come such a long way.

325
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,380
[Master Hei, Master Shou, Master Pang]
Do you have important business here?

326
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,380
I am only accompanying Tingyan on a vacation.

327
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,660
No need to be nervous. Please rise.

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,140
A vacation?

329
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,860
To fix the sleep schedule and unwind...

330
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,100
To fix my sleep schedule and unwind.

331
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,210
In short...

332
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,380
In short, to take a vacation.

333
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,970
...a vacation.

334
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,100
What a fine word.

335
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,100
May I ask, Grandmaster,

336
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,250
how long you plan to stay in Grain Rain Vale?

337
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,450
It's up to her.

338
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,340
Everyone,

339
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,420
please allow me to lead you to rest for now.

340
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,860
Later, we will hold a banquet for you, our honored guests.

341
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,010
But unlike the outside world,

342
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,690
we have only simple vegetables, fruits, and livestock.

343
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,900
Please forgive us for the lack of delicacies.

344
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,380
Then why don't we have a barbecue together?

345
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,640
I have plenty of grills with me.

346
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,690
Everyone can just bring

347
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,940
whatever they've grown or raised.

348
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,340
In that case,

349
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,450
we will hold a barbecue gathering.

350
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,490
Grandmaster, what do you think?

351
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,530
As the Grandmistress wishes.

352
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,140
Then the masters and I

353
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,380
will go make preparations.

354
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,900
Yes.

355
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,580
That was a bit dramatic.

356
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,420
Enjoy yourself here.

357
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,340
I will return after giving some instructions.

358
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,140
All right... Come on. Let's go have fun.

359
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,620
Greetings, Grandmaster.

360
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,900
Grandmaster, is there anything else you need?

361
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,420
Are all those in charge of Grain Rain Vale here?

362
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,820
Yes, they are all here.

363
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,450
You sent Heng Lin to bring Liao Tingyan here.

364
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,490
What was your true purpose?

365
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,420
I heard that Tingyan had strayed into the Demon Realm,

366
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,860
so I invited her here to reunite.

367
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,100
We mean no harm.

368
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,730
It is true.

369
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,690
With your special identities,

370
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,860
it is indeed wise to be cautious.

371
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,690
For Grain Rain Vale to be graced

372
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,940
by the Grandmaster and Grandmistress

373
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,420
is our great honor.

374
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,210
Then please take good care of her.

375
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,970
We will do everything we can to look after our honored guests.

376
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,340
This is like a paradise in the Demon Realm.

377
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,620
Do you like it here?

378
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,340
Very much.

379
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,820
There are no corpses on the road,

380
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,770
and no killing or looting.

381
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,180
People here live in peace.

382
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,970
Sunshine is everywhere,

383
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,660
and the air smells of flowers.

384
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,900
It's the perfect place for rest and living.

385
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,450
If you wish, both the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm

386
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,620
can become the paradise you want.

387
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,420
Stop feeding me empty promises.

388
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,860
I am content just to enjoy a vacation

389
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,210
here in Grain Rain Vale.

390
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,620
My destiny

391
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,010
is to live a carefree life, eating, drinking,

392
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,380
and enjoying myself.

393
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,770
You are more and more like your old self.

394
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,210
What was I like?

395
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,860
Always talking nonsense, unable to take much strain,

396
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,900
and fond of eating and sleeping.

397
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,970
It's all thanks to you.

398
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,380
What's this?

399
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,140
Open it.

400
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,440
More pills?

401
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,800
If I eat all these,

402
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,450
won't I be soaring to the highest realm?

403
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,010
You can't keep doing this,

404
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,140
or you'll run out of blood.

405
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,180
These are only for taste.

406
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,530
No blood needed.

407
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,290
Then what's the point of eating them?

408
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,380
You like their taste, don't you?

409
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,050
Just eat them as candy.

410
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,250
Eat some more.

411
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,770
If you finish, I'll have them make more.

412
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,580
Too much candy turns bitter.

413
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,490
Taking it slow makes it taste better.

414
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,580
What are you doing? You need to cut that up.

415
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,430
It looks nicer this way.

416
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,050
Feng Qi, get some more of this.

417
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,860
I like it.

418
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,580
All right.

419
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,900
- Quick, come here. - Is this done yet?

420
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,730
Yes...

421
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,290
- Put it down here. - Hurry.

422
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,420
Get two skewers fresh off the grill.

423
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,940
Here, my lord.

424
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,210
It smells so good.

425
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,770
Lamb skewers.

426
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,450
These are lamb skewers, fat and lean together.

427
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,690
Silly.

428
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,900
You eat them like this.

429
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,940
Senior Sister,

430
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,730
whose Qingling melons do you think

431
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,530
are better, his or mine?

432
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,620
They are both good.

433
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,180
We were just arguing

434
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,940
over whose melon deserves

435
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,490
to be called the true Qingling melon.

436
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,940
Please judge for us.

437
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,050
Please taste them.

438
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,210
Yours is sweet, and yours is crisp.

439
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,690
I say call this Sweet Qingling Melon

440
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,770
and this Crisp Qingling Melon.

441
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,820
Thank you.

442
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,420
Please enjoy!

443
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,180
Thank you, Senior Sister.

444
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,490
Junior Sister Liao, and sir,

445
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,380
please try the beef of the celestial ox I raised.

446
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,860
My junior sister

447
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,380
carefully marinated and grilled it.

448
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,050
Paired with our vale's wine,

449
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,250
the taste is excellent.

450
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,530
He rarely

451
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,660
slaughters his treasured oxen.

452
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,100
Even we hardly ever get to eat this.

453
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,250
Go on. Try these.

454
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,010
You don't want to? Then have a drink!

455
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,940
Here.

456
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,250
Don't be rude!

457
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,530
You two have never left the vale,

458
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,900
so you don't know who this great man is.

459
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,100
Mind your manners.

460
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,900
It's all right.

461
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,250
The truth is,

462
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,450
he never eats this sort of thing,

463
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,530
so I am eating all of these.

464
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,180
If he won't drink, I'll drink with you.

465
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,290
To celebrate Tingyan's reunion with her master,

466
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,250
I will drink a cup as well.

467
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,140
How nice. I wish I had a cultivation partner too.

468
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,900
Senior Sister,

469
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,010
- is it hard to find one? - Here's to you, Grandmaster.

470
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,180
Not too hard, I suppose.

471
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,250
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

472
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,940
Senior Sister, how did you and your partner

473
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,010
find each other?

474
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,450
Don't you still have work to finish?

475
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,580
- Go. - Come on.

476
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,150
- Go. - Let's go.

477
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,690
What are you laughing at?

478
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,250
They all seem so scared of you.

479
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,860
Anyone who knows my name fears me.

480
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,010
I don't fear you.

481
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,530
You don't?

482
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,970
I'm terrified.

483
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,140
Grandmaster, Tingyan,

484
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,940
try this braised duck.

485
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,660
The Demon Realm is not like the Immortal Realm. With spirit veins scarce,

486
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,250
we had to work very hard

487
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,380
to raise these Lvhua ducks.

488
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,380
They are tender and delicious, though.

489
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,290
Let me try.

490
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,290
Delicate texture, juicy, and so tasty I feel...

491
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,730
Like your tongue might melt away.

492
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,970
How did you know I was about to say that?

493
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,660
This duck really is delicious.

494
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,690
And it seems nourishing.

495
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,530
I feel so energized right now.

496
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,180
Junior Sister, Master, come and try this!

497
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,290
Let's go.

498
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,770
Coming!

499
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,490
Thank you.

500
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,580
Grandmaster, are you all right?

501
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,140
I'm fine.

502
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,420
If this goes on, Tingyan will find out.

503
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,100
Quiet.

504
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,420
Spirit Fire, coveted by all,

505
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,340
is nothing good at all.

506
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,140
I'm telling you,

507
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,290
it's all thanks to our sect's protection

508
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,140
that we get to live such a carefree life,

509
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,180
don't you think?

510
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,860
Yes.

511
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,820
Tingyan.

512
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,490
Did you enjoy yourself here at Grain Rain Vale today?

513
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,770
I haven't felt so relaxed in a long time.

514
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,450
Though Grain Rain Vale lies in the Demon Realm,

515
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,580
it has nothing in common with it.

516
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,140
When I first arrived, I, too, found it unbelievable.

517
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,820
If I could always live

518
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,050
in such a peaceful and pleasant place,

519
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,820
that'd be nice.

520
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,530
Yan.

521
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,250
If you like it here,

522
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,620
we can stay here together.

523
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,490
What, are you done looking for the one you love?

524
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,290
I have never stopped searching for her.

525
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,050
And soon,

526
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,530
I will find her.

527
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,290
Congratulations.

528
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,940
If you can find her,

529
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,820
bringing her here to live

530
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,010
would be a fine choice.

531
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,780
You will understand soon enough.

532
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,700
Master.

533
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,820
I feel a little drunk.

534
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,090
Then go back and rest.

535
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,130
I've eaten my fill as well.

536
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,260
I will head back soon.

537
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,940
All right.

538
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,780
Be careful.

539
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,010
Cheer up.

540
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,090
I think Yan and the Grandmaster are a perfect match.

541
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,860
Besides,

542
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,420
Yan has obviously developed feelings for him.

543
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,940
Don't tell me you can't see it.

544
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,050
Feng Qi, if you ask me,

545
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,530
you should just

546
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,780
stay her friend.

547
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,530
Really.

548
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,220
It's still too early

549
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,380
to say who wins and who loses.

550
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,420
Fool. Truly a fool.

551
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,010
Hongluo.

552
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,420
Look over there.

553
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,490
The moon is beautiful tonight.

554
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,700
Would you take a walk with me?

555
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,050
Everyone has their own troubles.

So that's a yes?

557
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,610
Has my tolerance gotten worse?

558
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,700
How am I this drunk from just half a jug?

559
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,940
Yan, are you all right?

560
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,780
I'm fine.

561
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,450
I must have drunk too much. I feel a little dizzy,

562
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,780
and even strangely cold.

563
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,740
Yan, does this place feel familiar to you?

564
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,420
Grain Rain Vale?

565
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,970
It does seem familiar.

566
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,130
Could it be

567
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,130
you really came here before

568
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,740
but forgot?

569
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,700
If you don't remember, I can help you.

570
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,300
Sorry, Feng Qi. I think I'm too drunk

571
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,490
to think straight.

572
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,740
Let's talk tomorrow.

I'll walk you back.

No need. I'll walk around to sober up.

575
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,490

00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,130
