And even knowing the pain,

91
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,500
you still chose to have me merge with the Spirit Fire?

93
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,820

94
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,330

95
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,900
you could withstand the Spirit Fire

96
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,620
and become the first to break the ascension curse.

97
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,410
But during the fusion, we realized

98
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,290
that your blood was so pure

99
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,650
that you needed a stronger Spirit Fire to merge with.

100
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,700
Otherwise,

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,330
your blood would devour

102
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,380
the Spirit Fire entirely during the fusion.

103
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,770

105
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,020

If our deaths

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,220

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,650
That's right!

111
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,140
We're willing to help Jiao merge with the Spirit Fire!

112
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,900
Me too!

113
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,050
Yes, me too!

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,900
- Me too! - I'm in!

for the greed of the Eight Palaces.

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,930
So we decided to feed the Spirit Fire with our blood

118
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,410
to form a Spirit Fire strong enough

119
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,140

120
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,530
But

121
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,570
once the blood sacrifice began,

122
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,740
we found that the Spirit Fire was like a bottomless pit.

123
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,340
Over 100 clansmen gave their lives one after another.

124
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,100
Not a single one gave up.

125
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,340
In the end,

126
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,380
the clansmen poured every drop of their blood into it

127
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,450
and finally formed the most powerful Spirit Fire in existence.

128
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,930
Sacrificing the entire clan

129
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,650
and leaving such a heavy burden on a child...

130
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,530
Should I call you pitiable, or despicable?

131
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,980
If we had to choose again,

132
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,020
we would still walk the same path.

133
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,100
Then why are you here?

134
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,450
I feared the Eight Palaces would figure out our plan,

135
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,380
so I feigned madness and set a fire,

136
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,860
making them believe I had gone insane

137
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,980
and burned the whole clan alive.

138
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,900
The final step for merging the Spirit Fire into you

139
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,140

140
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,290

141
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,900

a spy the Shi family had planted in the Eight Palaces

146
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,620
found me, barely alive,

147
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,140
and secretly took me away.

148
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,220
At first, the Shi family truly meant to save me.

149
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,020
But once I was rescued,

150
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,290
I was desperate to find you,

151
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,410
and from me, Shi Yongyou learned

152
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,220
the secret of how to break the ascension curse.

153
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,740
That greed consumed him.

154
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,570
Shi Yongyou and his disciple, Shi Qianlv,

155
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,500
stole a dying flame of the Spirit Fire's avatar

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,500
from White Deer Cliff

157
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,410
and used my body as the wick to keep it alive,

158
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,140
and at the same time...

159
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,860
At the same time,

164
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,220
Exactly.

165
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,410
Now that you've come here,

166
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,450

167
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,650

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,650

172
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,810
Look around you.

173
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,260
Now the Sima clan

174
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,050

175
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,410
So what if there is only you left?

As long as you can live for tens of thousands

177

178
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,860
as long as you don't die,

179
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,290
the Fengshan Clan will never vanish,

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,380
and the glory may one day be ours again.

181
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,570
Consume this Spirit Fire,

182
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,050
and not only will your wounds heal,

183
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,340
but you will also have two Spirit Fires inside you.

184
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,900
But beyond becoming stronger,

185
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,690
there is another possibility.

186
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,100
If I consume it,

187
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,690
the Spirit Fire might reduce me to ash in an instant.

188
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,220
Isn't that right?

189
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,500
You carry the atavistic Fengshan bloodline, a marvel unseen in ages.

190
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,810
You can accomplish what none of us ever could.

191
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,420
♪I'd bear no resentment or regret♪

192
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,940
♪Let my mortal heart fall to the human world♪

193
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,740
♪I'll trade it for a lone, fearless self and let the past drift away♪

194
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,500
♪With every regret I once held onto♪

195
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,900
♪I'll survive countless trials and tribulations♪

196
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,140
♪Let my mortal heart sink into the sea♪

197
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,420
♪I dream of a weightless self, soaring to the heavens♪

198
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,420
♪Neither alive nor gone, I'm bound only by endless loneliness♪

199
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,980
♪Watching the world change♪

200
00:13:52,060 --> 00:14:04,420
♪Yet still unable to see through the long night♪

201
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,300
Now your wish is fulfilled.

202
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,010
There's trouble

203
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,370
at Taiwei Mountain.

204
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,770
Sect Master,

205
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,100
Madam Ye sent word that Liao Tingyan had been found.

206
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,180
Order Ye Ruling to seize her and bring her to Taixuan Peak at once.

207
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,650
Otherwise, all her clansmen at the Yin Palace will die.

208
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,610
Understood.

209
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,820
I can sense that something

210
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,410
has happened to the Spirit Fire at Taiwei Mountain.

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,820
Sima Jiao may have already found it.

212
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,700
I'll go there first to check.

213
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,890
Notify the palace heads to gather at Taixuan Peak

214
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,130
and set up an array.

215
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,220
Once Sima Jiao shows himself at Taiwei Mountain,

216
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,820
I will use Liao Tingyan

217
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,700
to draw him to Taixuan Peak.

218
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,410
Then, the palace heads

219
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,130
will capture him together.

220
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,220
Understood.

221
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,700
Could this mean something unexpected

222
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,890
will happen to Sima Jiao?

223
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,340
What kind of fool curses her own cultivation partner?

224
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,890
He's so powerful.

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,820
No one in this world could kill him.

226
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,860
He might suffer a small injury,

227
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,890
but nothing serious will happen.

228
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,860
If only I still had the Transvision Mirror.

229
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,460
Then Jiao would be able to tell me he's safe.

230
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,300
Ruling!

231
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,180
Nianjiu?

232
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,220
Ruling!

233
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,700
Ruling!

234
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,980
Nianjiu!

235
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,490
Tingyan!

236
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,100
Tingyan!

237
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,300
Capture her!

238
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,890
Madam Ye,

239
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,610
I didn't expect us to meet again so soon.

240
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,180
How did you even find me?

241
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,060
In the Immortal Realm,

242
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,250
only I can recognize the traces of your extreme-cold nature.

243
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,180
Your cultivation has advanced rapidly lately,

244
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,890
and the traces have become clearer than ever.

245
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,650
So I should thank you for not coming to capture me sooner?

246
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,180
The Sect Master said

247
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,890
that if we could not catch Sima Jiao,

248
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,010
we must at least bring Liao Tingyan back.

249
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,650
Tingyan!

250
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,220
Tingyan!

251
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,220
You're courting death!

252
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,060
Madam Ye,

253
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,940
whose side are you really on?

254
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,820
How dare you, a mere disciple, question me?

255
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,930
Yes, Sect Master Shi ordered you to watch me,

256
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,020
but he didn't tell you to command me,

257
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,300
and I certainly don't need to explain my decisions to you.

258
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,020
Let's get back to business.

259
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,780
Take her away!

260
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,970
Move.

261
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,130
Let her go!

262
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,450
Tingyan!

263
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,500
Tingyan!

264
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,210
Let me out!

265
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,210
Ruling!

266
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,610
Let Tingyan go!

267
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,650
Ruling!

268
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,170
My Spirit Fire...

269
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,210
You are finally here.

270
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,500
You absorbed my Spirit Fire!

271
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,820
Centuries of planning, and you walked away

272
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,620
with the prize.

273
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,530
Sima Jiao,

274
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,890
you vile, despicable man!

275
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,020
I am flattered.

276
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,660
[Taixuan Peak]

277
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,300
Sima Jiao harmed my daughter,

278
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,650
causing me endless pain.

279
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,450
Now, I'll make him taste the same.

280
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,860
How can this be?

281
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,820
She has such powerful defenses.

282
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,610
I can't wound her at all.

283
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,580
Madam Yue,

284
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,860
we're against a strong enemy.

285
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,890
Don't act rashly.

286
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,210
Madam Yue,

287
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,780
if anyone here

288
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,020
destroys this tool

289
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,820
meant for the capture of Sima Jiao,

290
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,500
I will have to treat them as a saboteur

291
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,970
of the Eight Palaces' grand plan.

292
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,130
Ye Ruling, whose side are you really on?

293
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,410
Even now, you still have sympathy for Liao Tingyan, don't you?

294
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,130
Madam Yue, now is not the time for personal grudges.

295
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,260
We must focus on our task.

296
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,410
Master Ri is right.

297
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,060
Fellow palace heads, there is no time to waste.

298
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,260
Let's form the array.

299
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,100
Please notify Sect Master Shi at once

300
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,860
that Liao is in place,

301
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,500
and tell him to hurry and lead Sima Jiao to Taixuan Peak.

302
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,020
Qianlv, Madam Ye did it!

303
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,300
No!

304
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,970
No!

305
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,100
My... my Black Jade Lotus Pond!

306
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,260
A blood pool made from the blood of the Sima clan

307
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,100
will also be destroyed by the blood of the Sima clan.

308
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,020
Shi Qianlv,

309
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,060
this is only the beginning.

310
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,890
What are you trying to do?

311
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,170
Listen.

312
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,020
What's happening?

313
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,500
The spirit veins are burning!

314
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,170
Disciples of the Moon Palace,

315
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,020
move away from the veins at once!

316
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,650
Spirit veins burning?

317
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,060
That must be Sima Jiao.

318
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,170
I wonder how he is holding up.

319
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,540
Liao Tingyan must not be spared!

320
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,300
We don't have time. We must leave now!

321
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,410
The Shi clan's spiritual peaks,

322
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,690
temples,

323
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,260
and tombs,

324
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,610
and even your Taixuan Peak,

325
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,340
will all be engulfed in fire.

326
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,890
From this day forward,

327
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,650
your entire clan

328
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,300
and every spiritual peak you own will be gone.

329
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,780
Shi Qianlv,

330
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,650
how does it feel to see everything you worked for

331
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,580
reduced to ash?

332
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,100
Sima Jiao,

333
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,970
you've been planning this all along.

334
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,890
You will regret it!

335
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,820
Tingyan, get up.

336
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,690
Go now.

337
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,580
Why are you saving me?

338
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,540
I told you I never wished to harm you.

339
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,300
Go.

340
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,410
Let's leave together.

341
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,260
I can't.

342
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,610
In order to manipulate me,

343
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,610
Shi Qianlv brought my clansmen here.

344
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,300
I must stay with them.

345
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,860
Look out!

346
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,100
There's no way out.

347
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,820
Sima Jiao,

348
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,060
you think you've won,

349
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,540
but hear this:

350
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,450
the woman you keep by your side

351
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,500
is also on Taixuan Peak.

352
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,610
If we die, she will die with us!

353
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,260
What did you say?

354
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,650
You schemed and schemed,

355
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,610
yet you never foresaw

356
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,740
you would be the one to kill the person you care for most, right?

357
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,890
How does that feel?

358
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,650
Your arrogance has brought you retribution!

359
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,210
Watch out!

360
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,020
Sima Jiao,

361
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:29,450
this time, I can't wait for you to come home.

362
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,340
Tingyan.

363
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,020
Tingyan.

364
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,170
Tingyan.

365
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,500
Tingyan.

366
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,130
Tingyan!

367
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,020
Tingyan...

368
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,300
The artifact couldn't withstand my Spirit Fire...

369
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,620
♪Why must we suffer all this?♪

370
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,540
♪Piercing us through every season♪

00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,620
The traces of her extreme-cold nature left at the breaches

560
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,820
of the Immortal-Demon Barrier

561
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,820
were proof that she

562
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,010
passed through the barrier into the Demon Realm

563
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,300
during the great disaster 18 years ago.

564
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,620
But she

565
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,930
must have been gravely injured,

566
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,780
which is why we haven't been able to track her down.

567
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,930
There is only one Frost Fish in existence.

568
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,050
She is the perfect weapon to kill Sima Jiao.

569
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,410
You must find her.

570
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,410
However,

571
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,490
now that Sima Jiao has two Spirit Fires within him,

572
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,300
even with the Frost Fish, we won't be able to kill him.

573
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,780
We'll need the aid of an ancient demonic artifact.

574
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,570
Follow the map to find the Xingtian Chain.

575
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,050
Once the Frost Fish is refined into a froststone

576
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,050
and set into the Xingtian Chain,

577
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,050
Sima Jiao can be killed.

578
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,140
Then you'll drain his blood and provide the sacrifice I need.

579
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,300
I will depart at once.

580
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,450
Rest assured, my lord. I will rally the strength of the entire clan

581
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,860
to find that Frost Fish, Liao Tingyan.

582
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,740
[Celestial Crane City, Demon Realm]

583
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,780
[Celestial Crane City]

584
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,300
Stop running!

585
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,220
Hand it over!

586
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,140
Pretty lady...

587
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,340
Let go of me!

588
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,280
Please, have mercy.

589
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,860
Out of the way!

590
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,340
Eat.

591
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,820
We're almost out of food again.

592
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,010
After finishing this job,

593
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,860
I'll need to find more work.

594
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,570
Winter City is far.

595
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,620
Leave early and return early.

596
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,780
Be careful on the road.

597
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,490
Don't get yourself hurt.

598
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,930
I won't, Father.
