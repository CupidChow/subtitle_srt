5
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,700
Madam.

6
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,380
Why did you come?

7
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,130
Are you here to talk about Jie's transfer

8
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,250
or to change my mind?

9
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,100
Neither.

10
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm here to talk about

11
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,700
what happened between my master and I.

12
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,060
Then there's nothing to say.

13
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,620
You just go.

14
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,820
What are you doing? Are you barging in?

15
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,220
Madam, I...

16
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,740
Madam.

17
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,540
I'm here to confess

18
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,490
regret to you.

19
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,300
At that time in the face of the bandit,

20
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,980
I was indeed scared.

21
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,940
My feet seemed to be stuck to the ground,

22
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,610
and I couldn't move at all.

23
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,780
I was really scared.

24
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,310
When I should have rushed up,

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,460
my legs got weak.

26
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,420
And after that,

27
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,210
I didn't have the courage to say these.

28
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,010
What's the use of saying this now?

29
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
I know it's useless.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,860
I know it's useless.

31
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,940
But, madam,

32
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,140
you always think I'm guilty.

33
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,280
Actually I know it very well.

34
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,490
I'm sorry for my master.

35
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,340
I'm sorry for you.

36
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,740
And I'm sorry for Jie.

37
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,860
In my mind,

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,140
I blamed myself

39
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,860
and repented over and over again.

40
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,620
But

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,220
I never had the courage

42
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,700
to admit to anyone

43
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
that I, Cheng Hao, am a coward.

44
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

45
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm a coward.

46
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,980
Instructor,

47
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,360
I have something to do outside.

48
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,920
What?

49
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,930
Okay, I'll be right back.

50
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,380
Madam.

51
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
There's something at the police station.

52
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
I have to go back first.

53
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,740
What is it?

54
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,300
Is it about Jie?

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,060
No.

56
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,980
You think too much.

57
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,460
It's not about Jie.

58
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,420
Madam.

59
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,100
Whether you agree or not, admit or not,

60
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,460
I'm Jie's master now.

61
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,170
I will try my best to protect her.

62
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,370
But this kind of protection

63
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,100
must be predicated on her will

64
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,220
and respect for her.

65
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,130
You don't have to educate me.

66
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,630
I'm not educating you.

67
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,730
I'm not qualified.

68
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,060
Actually,

69
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,900
I come here today

70
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,300
to put an end

71
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,900
to the past.

72
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,380
I mustered up

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,130
a lot of courage.

74
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,930
I finally said it.

75
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,450
I finally did it today.

76
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,030
The pressure for so many years

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,480
has been relieved.

78
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,540
Madam, I won't say more.

79
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,340
Take care.

80
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,660
By the way,

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,060
by the way, madam.

82
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,020
I have one more word to say.

83
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,700
I hope you can also try

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,240
to put an end to the past.

85
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,720
Chief Cheng.

86
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,350
Hello.

87
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,940
Don't worry.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,310
We will definitely sort out the written report as soon as possible

89
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,710
and report to the bureau truthfully.

90
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,610
Okay.

91
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,460
Bye.

92
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,620
-Bye. -Bye.

93
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,250
Bye. Bye.

94
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,380
What happened?

95
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,860
Let's talk in the meeting room.

96
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,820
Instructor,

97
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,490
this is my responsibility.

98
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,290
It has nothing to do with Chief Gao.

99
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,700
You can punish me if you need.

100
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,540
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,490
I stopped you from investigating.

102
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,210
Why are you taking the responsibility here?

103
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,090
Stop arguing.

104
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,820
This is not a good thing.

105
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,500
The bureau will decide the conclusion.

106
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,780
Now,

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,220
let's be honest and realistic

108
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,130
to write down the situation well.

109
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,500
What exactly happened?

110
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,260
The joint operation.

111
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,500
Previously,

112
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,730
Chief Gao

113
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,180
stopped Qizi from arguing

114
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
with an old lady in her 70s,

115
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,370
who wouldn't let us in.

116
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,540
Later her house

117
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,500
was found something wrong.

118
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,900
Who would have thought that there was a tenant in their house?

119
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,450
He knew we were doing a big investigation,

120
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,040
so he moved to Xinjie overnight.

121
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,180
This person hid a detonator.

122
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,620
Don't know what happened

123
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,180
during the move.

124
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,900
Anyway,

125
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,940
he just lived Xinjie,

126
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,420
the detonator exploded.

127
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,060
Exploded?

128
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,260
Were there any casualties?

129
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,380
No.

130
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,980
Just in time for the city's investigation of potential safety hazards,

131
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,299
in the precinct if any safety accident occurs

132
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,900
or the lost of life and property is resulted,

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,570
the deputy chief who is in charge of community and security

134
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,409
will be dismissed.

135
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,570
Deputy Chief Chu of Xinjie

136
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,220
was directly dismissed for this.

137
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,460
It's said

138
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,020
to see what the next step is.

139
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,690
Maybe their chief will also be dismissed.

140
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,230
Well,

141
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,860
just because he came from our side,

142
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,140
he's related to us?

143
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,780
Yes.

144
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,180
In the process of interrogating the suspect,

145
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,940
Xinjie knew his trajectory

146
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,260
and felt wronged.

147
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,460
They think it's us

148
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,020
who didn't check and deal with the potential safety hazard

149
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,140
and threw it directly

150
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,460
to them

151
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,180
that caused the safety accident.

152
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,100
Don't know

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
who exposed this to the Municipal Bureau,

154
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,780
Then the inspectors came down to know the situation.

155
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,570
Alright, stop discussing

156
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,950
the inconclusive matter endlessly.

157
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,380
I have someone to interrogate.

158
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,530
It's clear enough.

159
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,660
I'll take my responsibility.

160
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,100
Chief Gao, this is my responsibility.

161
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,580
I should have checked back.

162
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,980
Stop arguing with me.

163
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,780
I

164
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,540
was about to resign.

165
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,460
I can't even take a leave of absence,

166
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,180
so I can make it up to myself.

167
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,010
Qizi, what are you talking about?

168
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:36,700
Qizi.

169
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,420
Qizi.

170
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,170
-Qizi. -What are you doing?

171
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,180
What...

172
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,050
What's wrong with him?

173
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,110
I'm leaving too.

174
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,850
Chief Gao, sit down.

175
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,780
We still need to discuss this.

176
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,820
Discuss what?

177
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,500
Your discussion

178
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,880
can't affect the bureau's decision.

179
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,800
But we have to make it clear.

180
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,260
Sit down.

181
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,490
Come.

182
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,420
Just say it.

183
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,380
Why aren't you home yet?

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,310
Didn't I tell you?

185
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,270
I'm working overtime.

186
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,620
How can you blame me?

187
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,370
Stop it. It's late.

188
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,640
You should go back to rest early.

189
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,100
I'm doing the upstream work.

190
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,220
If I don't finish the registration today,

191
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,820
Wang and others will have nothing to do tomorrow.

192
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,940
How about this?

193
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,770
You teach me how to register.

194
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,810
You go back early.

195
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,420
Without the alter,

196
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,830
you also need a good rest.

197
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm fine. I can suffer.

198
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,870
But you're different.

199
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,700
Zhao Jiwei, you said this again.

200
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,060
You're wrong.

201
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,140
Actually,

202
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,890
as long as it's something I like,

203
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,500
I won't feel bitter.

204
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,450
That's true.

205
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,140
I heard

206
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,760
that aunt didn't find the leaders of the station anymore.

207
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
Did she figure it out and leave you alone?

208
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,860
So I want to finish this quickly,

209
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,820
then go home to observe how my mom changes,

210
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,700
and seize the chance to enlighten her again.

211
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,690
Then you just teach me how to register

212
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,690
and go back early.

213
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,330
I'm almost done.

214
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,740
Okay, I'll help you to separate them.

215
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,700
Okay.

216
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,340
Have you heard?

217
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,290
Chief Gao may be dismissed.

218
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,080
Why are there so many things without the chief?

219
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,080
But Chief Gao seems fine.

220
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,420
Yes.

221
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,570
He's still working in the interrogation room.

222
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,300
Let me tell you some common sense.

223
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,340
We were in the next room before.

224
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,610
What is that place?

225
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,740
It's the inquiry room.

226
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,330
Do you know

227
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,060
what the inquiry room is for?

228
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,420
Inquiry is

229
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,820
the investigation and information

230
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,500
of people who are related to the case and who have knowledge of the situation.

231
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,060
And the interrogation room

232
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,610
is this room.

233
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,400
Think about it.

234
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,030
Why did we let you sit on a chair like this?

235
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,830
This is a chair for the suspect.

236
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,500
If we don't have

237
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,980
hard evidence of your crime,

238
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,610
would we do that?

239
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,260
Then will I

240
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,860
be sued or arrested?

241
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,720
It's not up to me.

242
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,910
It's up to the law.

243
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,260
But

244
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,060
I know one thing clearly.

245
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,460
If you can truthfully explain the situation,

246
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,740
it'll be beneficial

247
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,700
to your future arrest

248
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,540
or sentencing.

249
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,700
I didn't do anything.

250
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,980
I earned the money alone.

251
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,610
I don't think moving my own money

252
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,950
is illegal.

253
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,110
It's not just illegal.

254
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,620
It's a crime.

255
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,260
Let me tell you.

256
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,780
All your income

257
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,740
belongs to your company,

258
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,140
not your personal assets.

259
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,180
Plus, you reported it yourself.

260
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,790
What is this called?

261
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,790
It's a false alert.

262
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,420
We can arrest you.

263
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,220
Besides,

264
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,230
your misappropriation of funds

265
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,660
is called the professional embezzlement.

266
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,220
Since the amount is huge,

267
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,410
we're going to hand you over to the Economic Investigation Brigade.

268
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,940
Think about it.

269
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,340
What else do you have to say?

270
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,220
I did earn the money alone.

271
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,540
Starting from finding the storefront,

272
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,860
then looking for decoration materials,

273
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,700
I did every little thing.

274
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,140
From changing a lock

275
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,300
to finding employees,

276
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,650
I did everything alone.

277
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,080
What did I do wrong?

278
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,820
Why?

279
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,460
Why should she share all the money?

280
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,500
What did I do wrong?

281
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,660
The material on the description of the situation

282
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,300
that triggered the explosion

283
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,860
during the joint operation has been summarized.

284
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
Today we're here

285
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,380
to discuss it again together.

286
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
If there's no problem,

287
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,660
I'll report to the bureau.

288
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,210
Take a closer look

289
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,580
and see if there's any problem.

290
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,660
Let me make a statement first.

291
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,140
No matter what decision the bureau makes,

292
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,220
I'm responsible.

293
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,980
Our chief was away for only two or three days

294
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,460
and I caused such a big trouble.

295
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,220
Chief Gao.

296
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,850
It's not your fault.

297
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,980
Enough.

298
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,540
You two are starting again.

299
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,250
Just listen to the instructor.

300
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,150
Take a look

301
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,460
at where

302
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,300
the problem is.

303
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,960
Chief.

304
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,830
Why are you back?

305
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,500
Chief, you're back.

306
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,820
Chief, why are you back?

307
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,900
Are you okay?

308
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,820
Well...

309
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,220
Sit down. You all sit down.

310
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,010
Sit down. You all sit down.

311
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,340
Qizi,

312
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,280
is this your medical examination report?

313
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,320
Why didn't you tell the station

314
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,300
about your minor depression?

315
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,220
During this physical examination

316
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,100
Qizi found out that

317
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,300
he had a minor depression.

318
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,950
I've consulted the doctor.

319
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,980
It's not shameful

320
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,990
to get this disease.

321
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,780
It's not shameful to be sick.

322
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,650
In addition, this disease

323
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,700
is associated with your irregular life,

324
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,020
poor rest,

325
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,140
fatigue and stress.

326
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,940
The station didn't notice this

327
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,060
is also my negligence.

328
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,830
Our policemen

329
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,910
work overtime all year round, day and night reversal.

330
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,860
Every day faced with

331
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,100
negative phenomena and emotions.

332
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,860
So it's very stressful,

333
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,380
and physically and mentally exhausted.

334
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,990
We must pay attention to this problem

335
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,580
and reduce late nights overtime work.

336
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,940
With strong bodies and healthy minds

337
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,940
can we serve the people better.

338
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,140
Qizi,

339
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,490
control your emotions.

340
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,300
Look, you are red-eyed.

341
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,060
Control your emotions.

342
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,890
It's okay.

343
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,780
Well,

344
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,730
I'll say more

345
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,339
about this joint enforcement

346
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,940
and the sudden explosion.

347
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,410
In a good way,

348
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,619
it was because

349
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,900
of our joint enforcement

350
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,700
that a larger uncontrollable safety accident

351
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,420
was avoided.

352
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,540
In the bad case,

353
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,130
there were flaws in our work.

354
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,619
We have to summarize

355
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,540
and reflect on ourselves.

356
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,420
So that the future work can be done well.

357
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,430
The bureau

358
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,850
hasn't decided this yet.

359
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,820
But all the leaders think

360
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,180
it was an accident.

361
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,420
If there are any consequences

362
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,020
of this matter,

363
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,660
I'll take the responsibility.

364
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,660
Chief.

365
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,940
How could you take the responsibility?

366
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,900
I didn't handle this well.

367
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,940
I should be responsible for anything that happens.

368
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,410
What are you talking about?

369
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,880
You were taking my transfer.

370
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,100
It must be me to take the responsibility if anything happens.

371
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,900
No, Chief...

372
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,460
Since you're back,

373
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,100
then you better

374
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,760
take the community yourself.

375
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,300
Don't throw up your job.

376
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,300
You'll take the community

377
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,840
and the criminal investigation at the same time.

378
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,020
In terms of security,

379
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,800
it still belongs to Chief Cheng.

380
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,700
If you have something to do, just do it.

381
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,580
If something happens, I'll take the responsibility.

382
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,260
Looks like the chief worked out splendid plans

383
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,670
instead of taking three days off.

384
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,030
Chief, it's good to have you back.

385
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,180
You're back,

386
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,680
so my heart will be at ease.

387
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,580
Really, you are our mainstay.

388
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,220
Fine.

389
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,260
Stop flattering me.

390
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,180
I'm not.

391
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,740
Instructor speaks our mind.

392
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,500
Right?

393
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,620
-You don't know these days we... -I know what you're saying.

394
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,190
Well.

395
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,780
Enough.

396
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,340
Well, Qizi,

397
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,230
we will

398
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,930
have a meeting again to discuss

399
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,290
and give you a few days off.

400
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,930
You should go back and rest.

401
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,180
-Don't feel pressured. -Okay.

402
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,870
Go back first.

403
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,290
Okay.

404
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,140
ZhiJie.

405
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,700
Don't go.

406
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,930
You also sit down.

407
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,420
We have a few things to discuss.

408
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,260
Jie, what's up?

409
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,980
Master, you went to my home yesterday?

410
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,980
Yes, I did.

411
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,940
I went to

412
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,460
repent and confess to madam,

413
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,660
your mom.

414
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,540
At the moment of your father's sacrifice,

415
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,420
I was scared.

416
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,290
I didn't rush up.

417
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,940
I didn't save him.

418
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,380
So I'm responsible

419
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,980
for your father's sacrifice.

420
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,060
Master, what are you talking about?

421
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,130
Who doesn't fear when it's dangerous?

422
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,380
Besides,

423
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,970
even if you really rush up there,

424
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,570
can you save my dad?

425
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,290
At least I should have done my best.

426
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,940
Master, don't blame yourself.

427
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,220
No one is perfect.

428
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,220
I don't want to be perfect.

429
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,580
I just want to be honest

430
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,770
to face and bear it.

431
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,060
I got it.

432
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,260
What did you get?

433
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,940
I didn't mean to educate you.

434
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,940
I'm just talking about my feelings.

435
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,770
I didn't say you were educating me.

436
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,860
Recently I also feel that

437
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,370
I don't need to be brave in everything.

438
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,760
Instead of being brave,

439
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,210
it's even harder

440
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,180
to do every little thing well and solidly.

441
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,100
How do we talk about this?

442
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,220
Why are you here for me?

443
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,980
When I went home yesterday,

444
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,420
I found my mom had changed a bit.

445
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,780
What change?

446
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,820
Not very much.

447
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,620
I just feel that

448
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,850
she didn't ask me about my transfer.

449
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,380
Then I saw the fruit basket.

450
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,420
She said you were here.

451
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,620
I asked a few more questions.

452
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,740
She changed the subject again.

453
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,720
She sent me out this morning

454
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,650
and didn't force me again.

455
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,540
That's good.

456
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,420
Jie, don't be anxious about your mom.

457
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,460
It's not cold in a day.

458
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,530
Take your time.

459
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
I also found that

460
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,260
as long as I accept my mom psychologically,

461
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,300
I won't be so anxious.

462
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,930
Sis.

463
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,990
Sis.

464
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,060
I'm your sister.

465
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,860
Sis.

466
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,170
You're not home?

467
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,030
I'll leave if you're not home.

468
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,630
Listen.

469
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,780
We've arranged

470
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,820
to go shopping today.

471
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,980
A big mall named What Mao

472
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,220
opened here.

473
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,100
There's food, drink and fun.

474
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,260
It's very interesting.

475
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,060
Just go by yourselves.

476
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,550
I'll leave if you're not home.

477
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,540
I'm really leaving.

478
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,400
Dawei's mom, don't just leave.

479
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm coming down.

480
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,990
Let's go.

481
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,860
Come on, sis.

482
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,420
Come down and dance

483
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,820
for some exercise.

484
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,050
I can't dance. So vulgar.

485
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,340
What did you say?

486
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,510
What do you mean?

487
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,940
Do you not want to dance or do you not know how to dance?

488
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,700
The steps are quite complicated. Seriously.

489
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,680
You called this complicated?

490
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,380
Look at you, you're dancing with the same hand and foot

491
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,660
and you even don't know.

492
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,340
What did you say?

493
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,690
You're dancing with the same hand and foot.

494
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,340
I'm with the same hand and foot?

495
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,220
Fine.

496
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,050
Let me see how you dance differently.

497
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,410
Come on. Do a dance.

498
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,960
Let's ignore her. Let's dance ourselves.

499
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,210
Let's dance. Let's ignore her.

500
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,410
Sis,

501
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,540
do you want to dance?

502
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,660
No.

503
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,580
I just want to tell you

504
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,500
when I was young,

505
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,260
Xia Jie's father and I

506
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,580
won an award for dancing in the institution.

507
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,260
OK. Take me as Xia Jie's father then.

508
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,410
Let's dance. Come on.

509
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,300
I can't dance here.

510
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,770
I can't dance here.

511
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,500
-Why can't you dance? Just dance. -I'll do it myself. Do it myself.

512
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,730
Take it down. Come on.

513
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,570
I'll put it here.

514
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,500
I see you...

515
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,620
You just said here's vulgar.

516
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,460
How can I dance here

517
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,420
without music?

518
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,780
Come on, give her some music.

519
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,340
Watch my sis dance.

520
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,860
OK.

521
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,970
Music.

522
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,010
Come on, girls.

523
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,620
Come on.

524
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,100
Thank you.

525
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,050
Please enjoy.

526
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,890
Sis, we've dealt.

527
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
We'll just chat casually.

528
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
I heard that he has a girlfriend now.

529
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,700
Maybe it's true.

530
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,520
I know what to say.

531
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,780
Don't worry.

532
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,170
Please come in.

533
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,160
You're coming.

534
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,670
Sorry, I'm late.

535
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,630
Xiangzhi, let me introduce.

536
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,860
This is Ms. Xu,

537
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,830
Xia Jie's colleague's mother.

538
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,940
We've been spending a lot of time together lately.

539
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,940
I happened to pass by your company today.

540
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,810
Hello. Hello.

541
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,810
Hello, Liang.

542
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,940
I'm Xu Cuiping.

543
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,820
Liang Xiangzhi.

544
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,430
Hello. Hello. Hello.

545
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,420
Have a seat, bro.

546
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,020
Sit.

547
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,740
Sit down.

548
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,420
Sis, have a seat.

549
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,340
Say something.

550
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,960
Liang, have some water, Liang.

551
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,500
I'll order some for you.

552
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,560
I'll go by myself.

553
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,990
No, Liang, take a seat.

554
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,220
Bro, have a seat.

555
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,020
I'll order some for you.

556
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,850
I don't know what you want to drink,

557
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,010
but you can drink whatever I order.

558
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,590
Thank you.

559
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,760
Are you doing well?

560
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,300
I haven't seen you since we parted in Dali.

561
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,740
You still miss me?

562
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,520
Don't be like this.

563
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,990
What did you say in Dali?

564
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,220
Didn't you tell me not to look for you?

565
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,080
You just do whatever I said?

566
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,220
Then you...

567
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,420
Alright, let's stop talking it.

568
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,030
She is a big mouth.

569
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,690
Liang.

570
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,700
Thank you.

571
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,370
Liang, I don't know what you like.

572
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,380
I ordered something cold for you.

573
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,090
Sure.

574
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,010
Look at my memory.

575
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,580
I have work to do on the project.

576
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,750
I've forgot.

577
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,080
You just sit down and talk.

578
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,920
-I'm leaving. -Okay.

579
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,180
Take care.

580
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,420
Bro, take a seat.

581
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,620
Take care.

582
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,770
See you.

583
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,290
Take care.

584
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,960
Who is she?

585
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,380
She's just temperamental

586
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,200
and nuts.

587
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,820
How are you? Are you okay?

588
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,130
I heard you've got someone.

589
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,020
It's been so many years.

590
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,260
Don't you even know

591
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,700
my heart?

592
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,430
Xiangzhi, here.

593
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,960
How did you get here by taxi?

594
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,620
Jie is busy at the station,

595
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,900
so I didn't ask her to send.

596
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,660
I've thought the bureau could send a car.

597
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,090
I didn't call the bureau.

598
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,570
This is private.

599
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,380
Why should we call the bureau?

600
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,530
Right.

601
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,740
Let's go.

602
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,500
By the way,

603
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,980
I booked the economy classes.

604
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,010
Are you okay with it?

605
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,900
I'm okay if you're okay.

606
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,260
Of course I'm okay.

607
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,020
Here's the thing.

608
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,340
I think

609
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,580
in the future,

610
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,570
I'll slowly recede from the front line.

611
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Then whenever I have time

612
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I'll take you on vacation to play around the world.

613
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,980
Wherever you go,

614
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,500
wherever I follow.

615
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,270
This way.

616
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,260
Sir.

617
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,940
Come in.

618
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,010
Chief, you want to see me?

619
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,020
Xia Jie.

620
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,350
Wang from the Household Registration Department

621
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,220
will give birth in a few weeks.

622
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,080
She's the only official police in the department.

623
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,290
The rest are the auxiliary police.

624
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,220
So the station decided

625
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,180
to transfer you to the Household Registration Department

626
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,570
to take over Wang's job.

627
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,500
Chief,

628
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,060
I've made it clear to my mom.

629
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,820
My mom acknowledges me.

630
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,590
I said I didn't want to go to the Household Registration Department.

631
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,090
She also promised me not to interfere.

632
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,620
Didn't my master tell you about this?

633
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,460
This decision

634
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,530
was adjusted after careful consideration

635
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,020
based on everyone's situation at the station.

636
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,780
It has nothing to do with your mother.

637
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,660
This is the organization's decision.

638
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,020
The does my master agree?

639
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,070
Your master must agree

640
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,140
to the organization's arrangement.

641
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,140
Yes, Chief.

642
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,940
Okay.

643
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,410
Now I'll take you

644
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,560
to the Household Registration Department.

645
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,340
Let's get familiar with the situation.

646
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,980
Let's go.

647
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,520
Here.

648
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,890
Wang.

649
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,350
Chuan,

650
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,310
you deal with it.

651
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,580
I brought your successor here.

652
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,460
Xia Jie, you are here.

653
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,380
It's me who wanted you.

654
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,530
The chief asked me to choose a person

655
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,340
from the policewomen at the station.

656
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,760
I mentioned you first.

657
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,730
You're stable and smart.

658
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,330
It's best to be a household registration police.

659
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,500
Thank you, Wang.

660
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,900
Wang, you still have two weeks.

661
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,020
During these two weeks,

662
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,820
you should teach Xia Jie

663
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,890
and make sure that during your maternity leave,

664
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,700
our household registration work

665
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,980
cannot drop the ball.

666
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,580
Don't worry, chief.

667
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,170
A girl as smart as Xia Jie

668
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,980
doesn't need my guidance. She can...

669
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,200
What's wrong?

670
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,700
What's wrong, Wang?

671
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,940
I don't feel right.

672
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,930
Xia Jie, take me to the toilet.

673
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,190
Here.

674
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,180
Slow down.

675
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,010
Oh no.

676
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,180
What's wrong?

677
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,110
Hurry. Call an ambulance for me.

678
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,780
Hurry!

679
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,280
Okay.

680
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,110
Wang's water broke.

681
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,300
Call an ambulance!

682
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,070
What happened?

683
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,050
Wang's water broke in the toilet.

684
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,980
What's wrong?

685
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,860
Wang's water broke.

686
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,460
Call an ambulance!

687
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,060
No.

688
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,940
It's too late to call an ambulance now.

689
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,420
Ding, get IVICO here.

690
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,060
Okay.

691
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,220
-Wang's water broke. -You two go...

692
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,180
Go get the stretcher.

693
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,740
Yes.

694
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,820
Come two girls

695
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,540
to help Xia Jie.

696
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,220
Come on.

697
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,460
Be careful down the slope.

698
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,540
Orient the wheels.

699
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,420
-Zhigang, give me a hand. -Come on.

700
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
Back up.

701
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,170
Slow down.

702
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,540
Stop, back up.

703
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,690
-Watch out for the car. -Back up. Stop.

704
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,820
I've contacted your family. Stop.

705
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,420
And the hospital.

706
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,120
Don't worry.

707
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,140
Xia Jie. Xia Jie.

708
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,530
I'll leave the Household Registration Department to you.

709
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,700
Don't worry. I'll try my best.

710
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,780
You can ask me anytime.

711
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,820
You just give birth to the child.

712
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,100
You, you go along.

713
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,500
Okay.

714
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,710
Wait.

715
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,170
What a coincidence.

716
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,620
Just give birth when say so.

717
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,250
Look.

718
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,690
Fortunately, I transfer you to do it.

719
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,050
If you don't,

720
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,540
there will be in big trouble, right?

721
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,620
Xia Jie, are you really going to the Household Registration Department?

722
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,660
Otherwise?

723
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,520
Can I disobey the chief's order?

724
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,120
It's like you haven't.

725
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,160
That's a matter of principle.

726
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,590
Wang is going to give birth this time.

727
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,620
The Household Registration Department is short of people.

728
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,820
This is inevitable.

729
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,970
Don't think too much.

730
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,670
Maybe it's just a transfer.

731
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,820
After Wang gives birth, she'll be transferred back.

732
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,500
Your Household Registration Department is so boring.

733
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,460
Is no one going?

734
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,490
Who could be sent? You?

735
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,440
No, I'm not cut out for this.

736
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,449
I think Wei could do it.

737
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,020
Don't set me up.

738
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,100
I'm not going.

739
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,179
My community work is finally getting better.

740
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,840
See? There's no one.

741
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,090
Xia Jie,

742
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,820
have you reported to the Household Registration Department?

743
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,300
Are you used to it?

744
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,060
I'm trying.

745
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,469
You've grown up.

746
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,130
What is this called?

747
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,460
"A scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes".

748
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,340
Only you're educated,

749
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,699
you're the poet,

750
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,360
you're the literature master.

751
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,100
You can't even shut up with drumsticks.

752
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,409
Well, I'll say something

753
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,580
about the specific project of 100 days without burglary

754
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,659
mentioned last time.

755
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,020
I'll emphasize a few more words.

756
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,290
Our precinct has done a good job for a while.

757
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,350
It's mainly because you did a good job

758
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,980
of awareness, education and prevention.

759
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,260
Keep up the good work.

760
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,980
Some criminals

761
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,010
just want to

762
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,380
rob one more before the Spring Festival.

763
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,220
So we must be alert

764
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,170
and do the early detection and treatment.

765
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,020
Try to

766
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,950
put a perfect end

767
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,610
to the specific project of 100 days without burglary.

768
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,660
When the Spring Festival arrives,

769
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,460
I'll pay for rewarding everyone.

770
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,460
OK.

771
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,100
What are you doing?

772
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,410
Jiwei.

773
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,490
Someone in the Xiaoxinjia Community reported that

774
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,300
someone broke into their houses at night

775
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,420
and the house was burgled.

776
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,970
You're in charge of this community, right?

777
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,110
Yes, give it to me.

778
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,980
Thank you.

779
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,350
Why did it have to be now?

780
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,680
So troublesome.

781
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,140
Wang.

782
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,860
Have you seen my master?

783
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,300
Zhang just received an alert

784
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,080
and went out again.

785
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,070
Someone reported a burglary.

786
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,500
Can you come with me?

787
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,580
Sure.

788
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,480
Look, there are only three probes here.

789
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,550
Bro,

790
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,430
there are too few probes in this community.

791
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,510
How many times have I told the property management?

792
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,260
The property management just say

793
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,070
they can't receive money.

794
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,700
There's no property fee to pay

795
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,660
for the probes.

796
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,360
There are so few probes in this community.

797
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
It's hard to find people running away.

798
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,020
You're right.

799
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,080
Just at this time...

800
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,180
This specific project of 100 days without burglary

801
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,870
must not go wrong in my hands.

802
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,660
Yes.

803
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,390
Let's go.

804
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
Last night,

805
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,900
I checked all the doors and windows.

806
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,090
Nothing happened.

807
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,200
Everything was closed.

808
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,820
How did someone come in?

809
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,180
It's really scary.

810
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,820
How did you two know

811
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,140
someone came in?

812
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,670
The kitchen knife can't be running

813
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,750
from the kitchen to the living room by itself, right?

814
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,620
Did you lose anything?

815
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,070
That's what's strange.

816
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,900
Nothing was lost.

817
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,060
We checked everything.

818
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,070
Of course,

819
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,740
we put all the valuable things in the bedroom.

820
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,260
Did they know there was someone in the bedroom

821
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,300
so they didn't dare to enter?

822
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,700
That's all?

823
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,960
There are no surveillance cameras around Building 11.

824
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,970
There was one before. It's broken.

825
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,310
There are fewer surveillance cameras

826
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,340
in the community originally.

827
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,940
There was one before. It's broken.

828
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,240
Are you embarrassed?

829
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,580
So

830
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,300
why there's need of security?

831
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,920
How many times have I been on night duty,

832
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,980
I saw you playing phones and drinking with goji berries,

833
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,330
but just didn't watch the surveillance camera.

834
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,970
It's our responsibility to blame.

835
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,620
Then why there's need of security?

836
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,940
Bro, look at our salary.

837
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,450
Good job.

838
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,730
I didn't notice it at first

839
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,000
until I brought the child back.

840
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,710
I found a kitchen knife on the tea table

841
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,620
and checked the room again.

842
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,380
The money in the living room is gone.

843
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,930
The jewelry in the bedroom is gone too.

844
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,830
And two bottles of good wine on the wine cabinet.

845
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,020
Did the door get pried?

846
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,020
No.

847
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,300
It's scary here.

848
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,460
The door and windows are fine.

849
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,530
How many keys do you have in your house?

850
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,260
Only my husband and I have.

851
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,310
Don't worry.

852
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,410
Think about it again.

853
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,420
Have you ever lent the key

854
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,460
to any relatives or friends?

855
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,230
No.

856
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,550
We've searched several rooms.

857
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,770
They didn't take the worthless ones,

858
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,700
just took cash and jewelry.

859
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,400
By the way,

860
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,470
there are two good cigarettes in the drawer outside

861
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,290
were also taken away.

862
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,460
The kitchen knife are taken

863
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,010
from the kitchen to the living room's tea table at once.

864
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,310
Think about it,

865
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,630
if we were awakened at that time,

866
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,690
who knows what would happen.

867
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,010
Jiwei, put away the evidence.

868
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,090
Recall it.

869
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,870
Besides the items mentioned earlier,

870
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,890
were any other things stolen?

871
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,940
I don't think so.

872
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,410
Look, it's him.

873
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,390
Master.

874
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,690
He's in Building 6.

875
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,660
Closer.

876
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,740
Can you see the car number?

877
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,250
It's blocked. I can't see clearly.

878
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,050
There's a crack on the windshield glass.

879
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,530
Master, you can even tell that?

880
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,490
Look carefully,

881
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,990
when he passed the street light,

882
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,990
there are reflections from different directions.

883
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,020
Let's go back to the station.

884
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,500
Keep chasing from the surveillance camera.

885
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,900
Okay.

886
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,030
When did you buy the house?

887
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,620
Last year.

888
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,620
Last year?

889
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,180
Yes.

890
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,810
Please wait a moment.

891
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,450
Officer Xia.

892
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
Officer Xia, what do you think about this?

893
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,940
He wants to register.

894
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,130
His condition

895
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,180
is in line with the condition that registering by buying a house last year.

896
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,540
He also bought a house.

897
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,780
But the policy is canceled this year

898
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,250
and changed to register with a college degree or above.

899
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,290
According to this year's policy,

900
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,510
he's not eligible.

901
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,740
But he bought his house last year.

902
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,020
Well, Chen,

903
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,300
I just came here

904
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,600
and haven't figured out the policy yet.

905
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,030
Just deal with

906
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,950
what you did before.

907
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,300
We can't act on our own.

908
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,270
Officer Xia,

909
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,940
you're the only officer here.

910
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,510
You have to make the decision.

911
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,340
OK.

912
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,840
Pour a glass of water for the guest.

913
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,870
I go to the toilet first.

914
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,710
Okay.

915
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,010
Sorry, Wang,

916
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,900
Have you given birth?

917
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,220
Okay.

918
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,170
I have something to ask you.

919
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,580
Here's the thing.

920
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,950
Chen, come here.

921
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,260
Officer Xia.

922
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,170
Chen,

923
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,020
I'm not familiar with the rules.

924
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,740
But there's a principle

925
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
that I think applies to all of them.

926
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,790
That's the old problem with the old solution,

927
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,900
the new problem with the new solution.

928
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,950
He bought his house last year

929
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,530
and it fits last year's residency policy.

930
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,590
Then let's give him the registration.

931
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,540
Register?

932
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,560
Isn't it against the policy?

933
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,340
I'll take the responsibility if it's against the policy.

934
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,010
The policy has been changed

935
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,380
and the conditions are relaxed.

936
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,870
The center means

937
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,090
to expand the population

938
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,400
and strengthen the competitiveness of the city.

939
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,050
Register a person

940
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,940
who can buy a house here

941
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,340
and let him live and work here.

942
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,020
I think there's no problem, just do it.

943
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:51,820
Okay.

944
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,040
Well, give the things to me.

945
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,630
It's done.

946
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,940
Thank you.

947
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,610
Thank you.

948
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,590
It's okay. Just a moment.

949
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,710
Honey.

950
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,610
It's done. It's done.

951
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,180
Just wait. Okay.
