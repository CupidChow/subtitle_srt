Have you seen Officer Cao?

13
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,370
Is Officer Cao here?

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,100
What's going on?

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,740
Mr. Liu.

Officer Cao!

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,259
-Don't worry. Take your time.
-We're looking for Officer Cao.

We're dying.

Please help us find him.

00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,490
Go find Officer Cao.

We're gonna die if you go on like this.

Hurry up. Hurry up.

25
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,500
Calm down. Calm down. Take your time.

26
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,570
We've already gone to inform Officer Cao.

27
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,300
Look.

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,820
Look how scared he is.

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,380
Seriously,

30
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,410
Sir, you have to save us.

31
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,220
Don't cry. Don't cry.

32
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:25,130
Don't cry. Don't cry.

33
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,180
The police are here.

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,220
They will protect us.

35
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,860
Come on. Don't be afraid.

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,700
Don't cry. Don't cry.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,460
It's okay. It's okay.

38
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,300
Officer,

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,570
you have to do something.

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,660
You have to protect us.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,020
What happened?

42
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,100
Don't worry. Take your time.

43
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,820
Thank you. Thank you.

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,180
Don't cry. Don't cry.

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,490
Take your time. Take your time.

46
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,020
Sir, you have to do something.

47
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,450
They come around all day,

48
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,340
especially when there's no one around.

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,540
They come around at night,

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,460
just to scare us.

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,900
Every day we live in fear.

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,420
We thought,

53
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,410
fine, we can't fight,

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,170
can't we just hide?

55
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,300
So we wanted to send the kid

56
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,550
to his grandparents' house

57
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,990
to hide out.

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,740
His grandpa is not in good health either.

59
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,020
But we had no choice.

60
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,300
We had to send the kid there.

61
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,130
But as soon as we left the gate,

62
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,610
we were spotted.

63
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,700
Someone was following us.

64
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,820
Slow down.

65
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,870
Sir, tell me,

66
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,950
what are we gonna do with our lives?

67
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,420
You got to do something about it.

68
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,740
Now we can't go to work,

69
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,540
and we can't go home.

70
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,890
What are we gonna do?

71
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,500
Yes.

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,810
Please calm down.

73
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,900
Calm down.

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,250
How are we supposed to calm down?

75
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,820
How about this?

76
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,800
If you don't give us a solution,

77
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,850
we're not leaving today.

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,370
We'll stay here for the today.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,250
Mr. Liu, calm down.

80
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,250
Trust us.

81
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,970
We're gonna fix it for you.

82
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,480
I'm afraid we can't wait for

83
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,750
the time you're talking about.

84
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,610
Don't worry. You have to trust the police.

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,030
We'll do everything we can to fix it

86
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,370
and keep you safe.

87
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,210
Okay?

88
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,850
Okay.

89
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,079
Here, grab a bite.

90
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,750
Sister.

91
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:19,850
No.

92
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,579
Hurry up. Hurry up.

93
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,899
We need to change our strategy.

94
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,280
It's taken so long to nail them.

95
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,680
Sister, I want two.

96
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,100
Let's break down the door and get him out of there.

97
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,530
He's gonna have to pay us for it.

98
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,410
Right.

99
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,090
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,370
If you break down the door, that's a home invasion.

101
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,750
Then we'll be arrested.

102
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,470
Yes.

103
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,050
-Brother, then what are we supposed to do?
-What?

104
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,060
What did you say?

105
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,620
We can't do anything illegal.

106
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,820
Dabao was arrested!

107
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,140
What happened? Dabao!

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,260
Dabao!

109
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,660
What are you doing? Be quiet.

110
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,600
Where is Dabao?

111
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,480
Be quiet.

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Line up, please.

113
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,610
The police officer

114
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,130
will explain it to you later.

115
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,870
Where is Dabao?

116
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,100
Dabao!

117
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:25,800
Where is my son?

118
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,460
Don't shout.

119
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,970
Come here. Come here. Come here.

120
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,010
This is...

121
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,450
Where is my son?

122
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,070
Here, here, here.

123
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,860
Let my son go!

124
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,610
Let's take our time.

125
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,060
Why did you arrest him?

126
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,550
Aren't you Officer Cao from Balihe Police Station?

127
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,420
Why are you here?

128
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,510
What's wrong with me? You don't want me here?

129
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,570
Listen.

130
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,710
No matter what district this is, the cops only catch the bad guys.

131
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,890
It's normal for police stations to help each other.

132
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,690
We always bump into each other.

133
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,200
It must be fate.

134
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,400
You're talking nonsense.

135
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,290
Where is my son?

136
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,280
Why is your family

137
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,270
so noisy?

138
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,530
Mrs. Sun,

139
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,330
Your son is Zhao Jinbao?

140
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,940
Yes!

141
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,650
Yes!

142
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,810
He was detained for taking drugs.

143
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,460
If you keep arguing like this,

144
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,170
you won't save him,

145
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,610
and you'll end up hurting yourselves.

146
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,300
Where is my son?

147
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,380
Let my son go.

148
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,300
Let him go. Let him go.

149
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:17,940
Let him go.

150
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,740
What are you talking about?

151
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,380
Do you know who you're talking to?

152
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,770
Do you know where this is?

153
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,210
Your family runs the police station?

154
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,730
Your son took drugs for the second time.

155
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,060
In accordance with the law,

156
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,940
he shall be detained for public security for

157
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,220
10 to 15 days

158
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,500
and shall be fined.

159
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
You just want me to let your son go?

160
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,930
No, what are you talking about?

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm telling you.

162
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,590
My son stopped taking drugs a long time ago.

163
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,520
That's right.

164
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,180
It's not up to you whether he takes drugs or not.

165
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,620
And it's not up to me.

166
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,860
The urine test says whether he's on drugs or not.

167
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,560
Let me see.

168
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,030
And there is evidence that

169
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,580
your son may now be involved in drug trafficking.

170
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,820
Listen carefully!

171
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,030
Drug trafficking!

172
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,730
If he's dealing drugs,

173
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,830
it's a different story.

174
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,020
Then it's not just a police detention.

175
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,900
It's impossible.

176
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,180
-Please get out of the way. -It's impossible!

177
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,820
Please get out of the way.

178
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,890
That's not true.

179
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,400
Sister.

180
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,980
No.

181
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,450
What are we gonna do?

182
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,220
What should we do?

183
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,860
Chief Cheng,

184
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,250
we're almost done with Sun's second daughter.

185
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,270
We'll take care of the couple.

186
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,060
We're going over there right now.

187
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,660
Let's get this over with first,

188
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,330
so that the couple can

189
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,390
live in peace.

190
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,290
Master, I'd like to ask you a question.

191
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,380
Isn't it inappropriate

192
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,250
that we use Sun's grandson

193
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,620
to blackmail them

194
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,180
into stopping?

195
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,700
Watch your mouth.

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,200
What blackmail?

197
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,250
There is no blackmail here.

198
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,050
Is it true that his grandson took drugs?

199
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,250
We had him legally.

200
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,170
But our goal was to save Mr. Liu's family.

201
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,180
That's how it should be said.

202
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,350
While dealing with

203
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,150
the civil dispute between Liu and Sun,

204
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,610
we found that Sun's grandson took drugs

205
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,450
and sold drugs.

206
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,090
We immediately

207
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,810
broke up this little gang.

208
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,740
Isn't there a more reasonable way

209
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,980
to solve this problem?

210
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,170
What is reasonable?

211
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,120
It's straightforward.

212
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,180
It saves time and gets the job done.

213
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,210
This is reasonable.

214
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,520
But I don't think

215
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,540
this approach can fundamentally solve the problem.

216
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,260
If we can't alleviate the symptoms, how can we get to the root of the problem?

217
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,540
Through legal means,

218
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,970
we can make them realize that their behavior is wrong.

219
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,429
You think they don't realize

220
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,740
there's something wrong with their behavior?

221
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,840
Their problems are not trivial.

222
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,460
But our priority right now

223
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,380
is to give the couple a life of peace.

224
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,360
Excuse me, nurse.

225
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,500
Where is Mr. Wang in bed 6?

226
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,610
He took a turn for the worse and  was sent to the emergency room.

227
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,800
Thank you.

228
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,150
Officer Chen.

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,470
Zhao, thank you.

230
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,630
How is it?

231
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,020
The doctor checked it out.

232
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,550
He said it's acute liver failure.

233
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,170
Even if they save him,

234
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,260
he'll probably

235
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,070
have to go to ICU.

236
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,630
That's karma.

237
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,440
He's your father.

238
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,350
Could you show some mercy?

239
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,580
-It's okay. It's okay. -You don't know the facts.

240
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,800
Doctor, how is Wang Jianguo?

241
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,590
Massive necrosis of the patient's liver

242
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,930
led to his liver failure.

243
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,540
The only thing we can do right now is replace the liver.

244
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,660
But the liver is a scarce resource.

245
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,830
Many people wait for years

246
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,230
and they may not get it.

247
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,100
Based on the patient's condition,

248
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,710
it's too late to line up.

249
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,730
Unless...

250
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,290
Unless what?

251
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,930
Unless someone close to him is willing to donate his liver.

252
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,860
Look.

253
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,350
I said there's good news

254
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
and good news comes.

255
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,140
The Sun family is willing to accept mediation.

256
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,660
All you have to do is sign this settlement,

257
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,430
and they won't bother you anymore.

258
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,380
That's it?

259
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,180
What else can they do?

260
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,520
That's not the problem.

261
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,050
They've been making trouble for so many days.

262
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,290
Our family

263
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,560
was driven crazy.

264
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,560
And the neighbors are about to be driven crazy too.

265
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,920
Now they want to settle

266
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,480
as if nothing ever happened.

267
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,900
I know and I understand.

268
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,810
In this case,

269
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,960
your family is a total victim.

270
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,130
But for unreasonable people like them,

271
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,930
I think the best thing to do

272
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,390
is to take a step back.

273
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,460
They can be shameless

274
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,880
and do anything.

275
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,490
We are educated people.

276
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,930
We can't do this.

277
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,510
Right.

278
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,180
We can't be unreasonable.

279
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,000
But not being unreasonable

280
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,280
doesn't mean that we have to eat humble pie and be slaughtered.

281
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,640
Isn't that bullying honest people?

282
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,500
Mr. Liu,

283
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,190
calm down.

284
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,000
Calm down.

285
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
No one said

286
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,830
you had to eat humble pie and be slaughtered.

287
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,140
I'm talking about this settlement now.

288
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,790
Didn't I just tell you?

289
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,520
This is about

290
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,980
your dispute with Mr. Sun.

291
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,080
The dispute will be settled

292
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,370
with the signing of the conciliation document.

293
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,250
They won't make trouble,

294
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,670
and you won't be wronged again..

295
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,490
Of course,

296
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,940
the incident at the door

297
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,370
is a different matter.

298
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,410
We'll take care of it.

299
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,460
Don't worry.

300
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,380
Don't worry?

301
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,660
We've been terrified for so long.

302
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,050
How can we rest assured

303
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,230
with such a reconciliation?

304
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,590
Yes, it's our fault

305
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,740
to make you feel wronged.

306
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,650
I apologize to you on behalf of the police station.

307
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,380
You don't have to.

308
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,770
But I also want you

309
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,770
to understand us

310
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,880
from our point of view.

311
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,600
We've been

312
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,660
working really hard.

313
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,430
No, what did you do?

314
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,160
We don't want this settlement.

315
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,940
We want their punishment.

316
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,610
We didn't say we wouldn't punish them.

317
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I just want you both to take a step back.

318
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,920
Don't blame each other

319
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,230
and sign the settlement as soon as possible,

320
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,210
so that everyone can

321
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,340
settle down.

322
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,990
Don't blame each other?

323
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,060
In other words,

324
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,730
about this matter,

325
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,270
we are also responsible for this dispute?

326
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,200
Then what is our responsibility?

327
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,290
Tell me.

328
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,200
My family shouldn't go through there

329
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,770
or my child

330
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,650
shouldn't be seen by his dog?

331
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,210
Or we shouldn't go to the hospital

332
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,150
if my child is hurt

333
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,860
or scared?

334
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,540
What's our responsibility?

335
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,540
Mr. Liu,

336
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,140
I didn't mean that.

337
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,080
But if you want to take it that way,

338
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,300
there's nothing I can say.

339
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,610
As far as things are concerned,

340
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,490
we want to help you

341
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,620
resolve your problems as quickly as possible,

342
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,390
so that your life

343
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,140
can get back on track as soon as possible.

344
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,290
Isn't that good?

345
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,430
Yes, it's good.

346
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,920
Anyway,

347
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,340
officer,

348
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,170
we really appreciate it.

349
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,190
But there's one thing I don't quite understand.

350
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,530
Did we do something wrong?

351
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,500
If we didn't do anything wrong,

352
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,150
why should we take the responsibility?

353
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,240
The dispute itself is the responsibility of both parties.

354
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,500
Mr. Liu and Mrs. Liu,

355
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,900
I think

356
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,400
you can take legal action in this matter.

357
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,470
Take legal action against them

358
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,140
for their harassment

359
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,160
and extortion.

360
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,220
Really?

361
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,840
Yes.

362
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,190
Are you trying to upset

363
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,070
Mr. Liu's family?

364
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,730
No.

365
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,300
I think they deserve justice

366
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,490
for themselves.

367
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,270
And our laws

368
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,250
do not condone this kind of scoundrel

369
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,860
and hooligan.

370
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,640
That's right. That's right.

371
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,380
I think this young officer is right.

372
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,370
We want to go through the legal process.

373
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,420
Well, think again.

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,880
We have to go now.

375
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,510
Think about it.

376
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm leaving.

377
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,930
Thank you.

378
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,560
It's okay. It's okay.

379
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,720
-You don't have to see me off.
-Slow down.

380
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,150
It's okay. Bye.

381
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
There's no need to see me off.

382
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,000
Bye.

383
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,170
You've only been in your police uniform for a few days.

384
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,430
Do you think you know everything?

385
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,640
Did I just say something wrong?

386
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,130
I asked them to litigate

387
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,710
and let the law uphold justice.

388
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,120
Am I wrong?

389
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,240
The law upholds justice.

390
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,780
What justice?

391
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,180
Do you know what the law is?

392
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,330
The law stipulates that

393
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,110
people over 70 years old can't be administratively detained.

394
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,860
Do you know?

395
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,920
It's a civil dispute.

396
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,300
It should be settled by negotiation.

397
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,400
Do you understand?

398
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,920
We've spent a lot of police resources

399
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,620
on these two seniors,

400
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,130
resulting in a backlog of cases.

401
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,970
How do we calculate the cost?

402
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,800
What about the Sun family?

403
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,100
If we let them go,

404
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,160
what about the law and justice?

405
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,220
What bad guy?

406
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,210
Which law tells you

407
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,830
who is bad?

408
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,670
Besides, do we have any proof?

409
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,700
Remember,

410
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,350
personal feelings are always personal feelings.

411
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,180
They can't replace the law.

412
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,859
Don't think you know everything

413
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,010
just because you've been in school for a few more years.

414
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,700
It doesn't matter if I'm right.

415
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,369
The law

416
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,040
will tell me right from wrong.

417
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,319
What?

418
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,770
Then you ask them to go to court.

419
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
It takes time and energy.

420
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,220
And it can get them on their nerves all day.

421
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,540
Two years later,

422
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,160
the court probably

423
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,600
won't award the Sun family money at all.

424
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,070
Even if the verdict is upheld,

425
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,440
the Sun family doesn't give the money. Then what are they gonna do?

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
Let them keep waiting?

427
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,220
They spend time, energy and money.

428
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,300
They wait for the court to enforce it.

429
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,520
Then the conflict between the two families

430
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,900
is settled once and for all.

431
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,290
Yang Shu, have you ever wondered

432
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,930
what it's like to be a guy with a lawsuit all day?

433
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,420
Is this the justice you seek?

434
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,390
The justice you seek

435
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,330
serves no purpose

436
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,430
but to destroy

437
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,070
the peace and happiness of this family.

438
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,100
Yang Shu,

439
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,500
are you deliberately working against me?

440
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,570
No.

441
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,910
You didn't tell the truth.

442
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,030
I know you have a grudge against me

443
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,540
about the villa call.

444
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,750
But think about it.

445
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,570
What did I say wrong?

446
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
Did I make a phone call?

447
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,990
Even if I did something wrong,

448
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,220
you can't bring that

449
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,780
to work to sulk with me.

450
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,610
I'm not.

451
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,680
I do have a problem with you,

452
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,450
but it has nothing to do with this.

453
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,900
In this case,

454
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,910
I think they should take legal action.

455
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,860
That's all.

456
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,120
Fine.

457
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,430
You're good.

458
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,490
You're better than me.

459
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,670
Should I

460
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,060
call you Master instead?

461
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,610
He's been sitting.

462
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,980
Master.

463
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,870
This matter

464
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,310
is entirely up to you.

465
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,560
Of course,

466
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,020
you'd better discuss it with your family.

467
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,920
If you don't want to,

468
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,370
don't force yourself.

469
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,990
Never mind what people say

470
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,330
or talk about.

471
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,600
I know.

472
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,340
No one

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,830
but yourself

474
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,990
knows what kind of pain you've been through

475
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,860
and what kind of feelings you have with this person.

476
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,950
So,

477
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,780
don't worry about what other people say.

478
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,930
And we told the Zhou's family

479
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,470
about your father.

480
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,180
Mrs. Zhou has been very angry,

481
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,470
but

482
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,100
she decided not to hold your father accountable

483
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,430
and agreed to settle.

484
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,220
If you're okay with that,

485
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,260
why don't you sign the settlement

486
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,380
on your father's behalf?

487
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,180
Who knew that bird could speak Chinese?

488
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,450
Wasn't it weird?

489
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,540
It must have been raised by Chinese.

490
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,610
No, it's too simple.

491
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,640
Then why?

492
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,000
Chinese is spoken all over the world.

493
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,390
Confucius is becoming more and more international.

494
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,700
Son, why are you back?

495
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,530
What are you wearing?

496
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,640
It's not serious.

497
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,060
You were wise.

498
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,220
You made more dumplings.

499
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,450
I'm going to cook dumplings.

500
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,620
Son, eat this.

501
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,420
Mom, that looks good on you.

502
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,240
Really?

503
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,410
Have a dinner first.

504
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,260
I was just around,

505
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
so I came to see you.

506
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,150
I'm going to wash my hands.

507
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,220
Wash your hands? Okay.

508
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,050
Li Yisheng,

509
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,520
what are you up to?

510
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,660
Didn't you hear that

511
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,470
your son coming back to see you?

512
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,140
Why don't you court him?

513
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,420
I'm cooking dumplings.

514
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,500
Mom, I'm here to see you,

515
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,660
not him.

516
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,220
Kid, I'm offering you a way out here.

517
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,710
What about the house you rent?

518
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,750
Is it comfortable?

519
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,580
By the way,

520
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,540
mom, I get paid.

521
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,420
I'll transfer the rent to you.

522
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,310
How dare you.

523
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,820
No need. No need.

524
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,930
Are you kidding?

525
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,190
Mom, I share the house with someone else.

526
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,900
Now we split the rent.

527
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,130
I'm under less pressure.

528
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,450
I want to

529
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,510
take the pressure off you.

530
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,910
How can my son be so sensible now?

531
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,790
That's great.

532
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,060
You should come back home more often.

533
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,210
Come on, the dumplings are ready.

534
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,900
Come back home.

535
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,500
Coming.

536
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,690
Here, try it.

537
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,140
What are you doing here?

538
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,450
Stop acting.

539
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,030
What are you talking about?

540
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,660
I just praised you.

541
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,310
Why did you start acting like a jerk?

542
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,940
You care about your family.

543
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,780
Why are you being so mean?

544
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,160
Like him!

545
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,850
-I...
-When he was young, he was exactly like you now.

546
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,960
-He and I?
-Just like him.

547
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,130
All right, enough about your son.

548
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,600
Let's eat.

549
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,130
Eat.

550
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,810
Try it.

551
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,050
Try it.

552
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,740
How is it?

553
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,170
Your dad made the stuffing.

554
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,340
Does it taste the same as when you were a kid?

555
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,660
Wait.

556
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,660
I forgot something.

557
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,510
I'll be ready in a minute.

558
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,230
What's wrong?

559
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,550
What's so mysterious?

560
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,050
This.

561
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,630
It was your favorite when you were a kid.

562
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,980
Capsicum frutescens.

563
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,140
-Oil Vinegar Noodles. -It's okay. It's okay.

564
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,130
It's okay. It's okay.

565
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,290
It's okay.

566
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,040
Did it spilled on you?

567
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,280
No, no, no. I'll do it. I'll do it.

568
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,980
No. It's okay.

569
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,060
Mom, I have some work to do at the police station.

570
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,980
I'll stop eating.

571
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,020
You haven't eaten.

572
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,780
I have something to do at the police station.

573
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,170
Tell me, why did I...

574
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,260
Nothing.

575
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,260
Chief,

576
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,420
you didn't see it.

577
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,170
It's so annoying.

578
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,460
I didn't expect

579
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,680
the young couple to be unhappy.

580
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,230
They asked me.

581
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,020
I was wondering how to persuade them.

582
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,300
Yang Shu lost his temper

583
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,050
and encouraged them to fight for

584
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,990
justice.

585
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,570
He had a quarrel with me.

586
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,260
I suffered several blows.

587
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,620
I was put in the middle of it.

588
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,490
I don't even know who is the Master anymore.

589
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,790
Okay, I got it.

590
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,080
There are so many people here.

591
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,590
Here, too.

592
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,900
-Come on. Play it.
-You're back?

593
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,680
I want you to save me.

594
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,160
Help me. Help me. Help me.

595
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,840
This way.

596
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,030
You can't go that way.

597
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,580
He just walked in?

598
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
That's not like him.

599
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,960
Yeah.

600
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,940
If we ignore him at this time of day,

601
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,040
he would be here already.

602
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,700
That's a little unusual.

603
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,620
Backwards. Backwards. This way.

604
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,060
Come on. Come on. Come on.

605
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
Both of them are kind of weird today.

606
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,620
Stay alone in a room.

607
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,870
Let them be.

608
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,350
They'll come out in a moment.

609
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,330
Didn't both sides sign the settlement

610
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,960
on that case he was on?

611
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,570
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

612
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,970
You're home.

613
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,810
You, too.

614
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,730
I saw no one in the room.

615
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,720
So I came out for a breath.

616
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,190
Me, too.

617
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,030
Let us not talk to each other.

618
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,840
Don't you talk to me about ideas

619
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,340
and theories.

620
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,140
Why is he so angry?

621
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,930
Yang Shu, what's wrong with you?

622
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,990
I didn't mean to offend you.

623
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,300
You don't have to be angry.

624
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,080
Come out. Let's play two games.

625
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,740
I have mixed feelings

626
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,880
about the dispute between the Sun family and the Liu family.

627
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,680
Do you know?

628
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,560
Because of this case,

629
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm having trouble with my master again.

630
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,370
He told me that

631
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,620
not everything is black or white.

632
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,640
Right and wrong are also relative.

633
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,470
I've known all this before.

634
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,500
But after my own experience,

635
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,010
there's a different feeling.

636
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,650
To be honest,

637
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,750
in my opinion,

638
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,200
your Master was right.

639
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,910
Chief.

640
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,620
Instructor.

641
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,870
-By the way.
-Chief. Instructor.

642
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,550
Hello.

643
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,440
Hello, Director. Hello, Instructor.

644
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:42,930
Hello.

645
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,680
Yesterday...

646
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,150
Right, right, right. I was just about to talk about that.

647
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:45,810
Today,

648
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,530
we'll have a meeting later.

649
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,500
Call Chief Cheng and Chief Gao in.

650
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,340
Chief.

651
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,060
Xu.

652
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,760
Instructor, look.

653
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,870
In our office,

654
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,860
we can discuss this matter

655
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,050
there.

656
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,830
Okay, okay, okay.

657
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,410
Let me take a look at today's work schedule.

658
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,430
Zhijie, you...

659
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,150
Chief.

660
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,390
Work an extra night?

661
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,050
Okay, okay.

662
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,400
Chief Gao, go to my office later.

663
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,000
Okay.

664
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,990
We have something to go over.

665
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,280
Do you want coffee?

666
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,020
No.

667
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,380
Hello, Chief. Instructor.

668
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,620
The Bureau issued two documents yesterday.

669
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,840
Why don't you take a look first?

670
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,380
Chief Cheng. Chief Cheng. Chief Cheng.

671
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,980
-Wait a minute.
-Chief, what’s wrong?

672
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,170
We... In my office,

673
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,790
something needs to be discussed.

674
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,510
What is it?

675
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,199
Instructor, tell him.

676
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,310
What’s wrong?

677
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,790
My goodness.

678
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,150
Morning, Chief.

679
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,489
What’s up?

680
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,820
Here, here. Come in please.

681
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,409
Sit down.

682
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,780
Chief,

683
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,790
I want to talk to you.

684
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,690
Do you want some tea?

685
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,100
No.

686
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,870
Yang Shu,

687
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,150
you are a learned man. A Ph.D?

688
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,900
A master.

689
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,210
Whatever.

690
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,500
Anyway, you know more than I do.

691
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,950
Actually, there's nothing I can teach you.

692
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,760
Regardless of the position,

693
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,280
in terms of age alone,

694
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm a few years older than you.

695
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,910
I know more about

696
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,530
the ways of the world than you do.

697
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,950
You came here to get some training.

698
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,730
No matter what you do in the future,

699
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,130
the most important thing is to learn the ways of the world.

700
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,670
For one thing,

701
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,830
nothing is black or white.

702
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,190
Even right and wrong are not fixed.

703
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,870
What is your knowledge for?

704
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,500
To experience these things.

705
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,580
Got it?

706
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,470
Yes.

707
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,850
Then what else

708
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,190
did you want to see me about?

709
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,640
Nothing.

710
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,510
Come to me directly if you need me in the future.

711
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,410
Let's talk about it, okay?

712
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,000
Chief, I got to go.

713
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,230
Okay, okay, okay. Go ahead.

714
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,260
Officer,

715
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,940
I didn't see you knocking.

716
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,260
Are... Are you leaving?

717
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,980
Why don't you go inside?

718
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,580
Okay.

719
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,930
I want to apologize to you.

720
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,980
I'm sorry.

721
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,140
No, no, no. You don't have to.

722
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:25,810
Sit down, please.

723
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,150
Have a seat.

724
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,780
Don't say sorry.

725
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,360
Please sit.

726
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,470
I was a little impulsive that day.

727
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,400
I advised you to litigate.

728
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,840
I'm not saying it's wrong.

729
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,860
But,

730
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,390
we should choose a way

731
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,760
that is more conducive to solving the problem.

732
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,100
The proceedings

733
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,340
are not without defects.

734
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,140
Reconciliation

735
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,530
does more good than harm.

736
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,130
Yes, I agree.

737
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
I agree with you.

738
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,990
You agree?

739
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,010
I agree to settle.

740
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,710
To be honest,

741
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,220
there's another reason

742
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,540
I chose to settle.

743
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,560
I never told anyone that.

744
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:29,150
I'm just glad

745
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,820
they haven't been around lately.

746
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,900
Peace is great.

747
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,940
I love peace.

748
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,060
The nightmare was terrible.

749
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,460
I really can't fight with them.

750
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,400
Yes, peace is great.

751
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,980
I love peace.

752
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,250
Of course,

753
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,630
you're the ones

754
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,710
who made this happen.

755
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,960
It's our duty.

756
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,230
That's what we should do.

757
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,840
Mr. Liu. Mrs. Liu.

758
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,820
Now that you've figured it out,

759
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,570
well,

760
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,980
we might as well

761
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,020
sign this settlement.

762
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,690
Do I have to sign two copies of this?

763
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,380
Well, I've already signed it.

764
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,280
Well done, Xia Jie.

765
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,080
You're the winner.

766
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,750
What's going on with you two?

767
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,960
Who are you fighting with?

768
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,530
What are you talking about?

769
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,020
I'm not fighting anyone.

770
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,360
I've been feeling more and more

771
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,470
like an outsider at the station.

772
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,060
I can't fit in here.

773
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,070
The mentoring relationship is strained.

774
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,540
Colleagues

775
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,950
become strangers.

776
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,730
Everyone looks at me

777
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,590
as if I'm about to leave.

778
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,150
I feel distant.

779
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,730
Me, too.

780
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,770
They think I'm special

781
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,670
and I need protection.

782
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,580
You... Are you still calling me a liar?

783
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,750
What's it?

784
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,970
Cheesy.

785
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,010
You're getting upset for nothing. Do you know?

786
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,740
My EQ is not low.

787
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,530
And I'm easy to get along with.

788
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,380
I've been popular since I was a kid.

789
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,980
But since I got here,

790
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,700
I feel

791
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,450
so lonely.

792
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,000
You got me.

793
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,230
About you two.

794
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,890
First, things are going so well

795
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,200
for you guys.

796
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,010
Second, you're thinking too much.

797
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,230
Go over things

798
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,640
that don't happen in your head,

799
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,300
then check if you are right

800
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,680
when they do happen.

801
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,710
Aren't you tired?

802
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,430
Students with poor grades like me

803
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,020
are used to being beaten down from childhood to adulthood.

804
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,550
After more than a decade, I'm numb.

805
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,640
This is called anti-shock numbness.

806
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,070
No.

807
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,320
Why do you think so much?

808
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,390
Just do it.

809
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,360
Fine, take your time.

810
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm busy. I got to go.

811
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,000
Let's go back, too.

812
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,680
You go first.

813
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,510
I'll practice a little more.

814
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,310
Okay, stay safe.

815
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,320
♫ Like a seed ♫

816
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,650
♫ Kissing the season ♫

817
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,500

♫ I choose to compromise ♫

822
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,040
♫ And embrace love ♫

823
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,890
♫ Love ♫

824
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,730
♫ From the smallest ♫

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:26,040
♫ To name the eye of the night ♫
