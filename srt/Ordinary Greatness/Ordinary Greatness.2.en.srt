00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,020
Of course.

6
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,420
This is a big case.

7
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,500
We have to do something.

8
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,259
We have so many people here.

9
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,380
How many are we going to catch?

10
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,420
One is not enough?

11
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,530
One?

12
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,590
Two cars with a dozen people for catching just one?

13
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,380
Then how many persons do you think should go?

14
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,620
One-on-one, to be a lone hero?

15
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,860
You think the police must risk their lives

16
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,820
when handling cases?

17
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,570
No.

18
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,930
One-on-one is a bit exaggerated.

19
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,940
Three-on-one is fine, right?

20
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,900
Shut up.

21
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,260
We know you're not a mute.

22
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,380
Guys, listen.

23
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,700
The suspect we're catching today

24
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,860
is called Ding Dayong.

25
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,140
He killed two persons

26
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,340
and is the most wanted criminal of our department.

27
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,250
This job originally

28
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,420
belonged to the criminal police group.

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,340
But since the informant knew me well,

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,740
he gave the notice to me.

31
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,579
It's a chance for you

32
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,380
to make contributions.

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,579
Do remember,

34
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,170
this man has weapons.

35
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,940
Don't act rashly.

36
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,540
Do not take actions unless ordered.

37
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,340
Understand?

38
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,300
-Got it. -Yes.

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,900
We should follow the order of Mr. Chen on the way.

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,290
Bro, I shall take a nap.

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,420
You'd better also take a nap.

42
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,460
How long has it been?

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,500
Why haven't we arrived yet?

44
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,420
Stop talking, they are asleep.

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,940
Why do you have so much to say?

46
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,980
Everyone is resting.

47
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,980
I haven't talked for an hour.

48
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,340
Besides,

49
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,020
someone has to keep watch since they are asleep.

50
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,000
Then just keep watch.

51
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,870
Cut the crap.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,920
You think you're right?

53
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,620
Officer Chen,

54
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,810
do you have a problem with me?

55
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
You can tell?

56
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,380
Okay, I'll say a few more words to you.

57
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,580
Remember,

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,530
Go up front if you're needed.

59
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,220
But if there's nothing important, just shut up

60
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,500
and stay behind, okay?

61
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,730
Don't get yourself as well as me

62
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,900
into trouble.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,820
What do you mean?

64
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,260
Aren't the police responsible for catching bad guys?

65
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,780
Yeah, right.

66
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,220
Don't you see everyone is resting?

67
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,740
If you keep chattering behind

68
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,409
and disturbing everyone,

69
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,659
will they later have the energy to catch the criminal?

70
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,900
A wiseacre.

71
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:13,930
Move!

72

76

Sir, madam.

77
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,960
Your son, Ding Dayong, has committed a crime.

78
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,500
He can't escape the law.

79
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,980
But according to the law,

80
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,340
if he turns himself in,

81
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,380
he can be punished lightly.

82
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,580
This is his last chance.

84

Let's go. Stop talking.

85
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,530
I have something to tell you.

86
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,570
Why do you have to say it now?

87
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
Listen to me. Let's go.

88
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,820
Let's go. Let's talk outside.

89
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,659
Let's go.

90
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,100
Chief Gao, is the information inaccurate?

91
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,420
We'll talk later.

92
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,460
Bro.

93
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,260
He's at home.

94
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,350
At home? Where?

95
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,200
In the wardrobe behind the old man.

96
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,830
What?

97
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,740
You didn't realize it

98
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,720
when he pulled you?

99
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,070
The quilt on his bed was warm.

100
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,130
That means he's still there.

101
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,460
There are only three rooms in the family.

102
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,110
Where else can he hide other than the wardrobe?

103
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,760
Then you're sure that he's in the wardrobe just according to this?

104
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,250
Of course not.

105
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,430
Think about it.

106
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,070
There are so many places where he can sit in the house.

107
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,020
Why must he sit in front of the wardrobe?

108
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,220
Besides,

109
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,240
don't you think those two chairs are too big

110
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,920
to be put in front of the wardrobe?

111
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:48,950
Good job, huh!

112
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,409
You did well on your first mission.

113
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,140
What's your name again?

114
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,100
Li Dawei.

115
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Okay, got it.

116
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,530
I graduated from the police academy.

117
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,830
It's normal

118
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,180
for him to notice this.

119
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,690
After all, he majored in this.

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,920
Yang Shu

121
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,980
majored in law in Peking University.

122
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,140
It's normal for him

123
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
to ignore such things for the first time.

124
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,300
He doesn't study this.

125
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,610
After you go on duty a few more times,

126
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,060
this will be just a piece of cake.

127
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,159
Chief Gao, let's go back now.

128
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,730
Bro, I've checked it.

129
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,220
This is the only exit.

130
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,220
You

131
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,850
take two young men to wait here.

132
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,500
I'll go back with Qizi and others to catch them.

133
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,090
Chief Gao, how about I follow you?

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,799
Obey the order.

135
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,010
Who allows you to have so many opinions?

136
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,860
Fine.

137
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,060
By the way, Chief Gao,

138
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,140
you don't have to go in through the door.

139
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,920
I opened the window of the side room.

140
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,040
You can go in through the window directly.

141
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,140
Chao, be careful.

142
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,580
Go.

143
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,300
Qizi, let's go.

144
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,270
Are you really a master of Peking University?

145
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,460
Of course.

146
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,200
Do you think

147
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,770
I dare to lie in front of the police?

148
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,050
I was also an undergraduate of Peking University. It's true.

149
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,780
With such great education background,

150
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,460
why would you come to the police station?

151
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,350
I was admitted to the Municipal Bureau.

152
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,340
Not long after I went to register,

153
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,660
I was suddenly informed

154
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,700
to get trained in the grassroots police station for some years.

155
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,580
I feel sorry for you.

156
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,020
It's normal.

157
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,300
I can get some work experience in the grassroots unit.

158
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,020
It's necessary no matter where I go.

159
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,620
Look at you,

160
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,290
you talked like a leader,

161
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,730
You're not like me.

162
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,050
I've been poor in study since young.

163
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,060
Peking University is too far from my life.

164
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,050
How did you get enrolled into the police academy

165
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,900
and graduate?

166
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,350
That's what I'm good at.

167
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,290
Unlike you,

168
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,470
I can always pass exams by a narrow margin.

169
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,800
But you can always get full marks.

Li Dawei.

172
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,690
Should I buy you some melon seeds and tea?

173
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,190
Hurry up. This way.

174
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,180
Follow me.

00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,130
This way.

176
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,660
Hurry up.

177
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,550
Dayong.

178
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,740
My son!

[Body-worn camera of Team Two]

180
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,380
This way.

181
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,960
My son.

182
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,820
Sir, madam, stop following me.

183
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,860
Madam.

184
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,060
Be careful.

185
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,030
Hurry up.

186
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,100
Dayong.

187
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,070
My son.

188
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,940
Go ahead.

189
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,220
Hurry up.

Hurry up.

191

He's right ahead.

192

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,460
Let's go.

My son!

195

Don't arrest my son!

196

Get in! Hurry!

Don't panic. Get in the car.

198
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,740
Chief Gao, we need two in the front.

199
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,100
Chief Gao, is it appropriate for us to do so?

200
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,060
Why not? Get in.

201
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,140
Yang Shu, get in.

202

Get in the car.

203
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,300
Get in.

204
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,140

-Li Dawei. -Let's go.

206
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,730
Let the car go first.

207
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,980
Wait for us at the village entrance. Go.

208
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,490
Oh my goodness.

209
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,470
Give back to me my son!

210

Madam, I told you not to follow us.

211
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
We're just following the law.

212
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,370
Give me back my son! Give me back my son!

213
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,220
What are you doing?

214
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,520
Go, Yang Shu, go!

215
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,180
Back off! Police!

216
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,650
Back off!

217
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,470
Step back. We're from the police station.

218

I want my son!

223
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,830
Quiet!

224
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,900
Back off!

225
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,540
-Folks. -Back off!

Article 27 of the Criminal Law,

227

to obstruct the state personnel in the course of their duty

by violence and threat...

229
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,180
Shut up!

230

Folks...

231
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
What's the use of saying this?

233
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
Folks, listen to me.

234
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,150
Ding Dayong is suspected of murder.

235
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,880
He's the wanted criminal.

236
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Please calm down

237
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,370
and cooperate with us.

238
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,900
My son didn't kill anyone.

239
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,680
My son didn't.

240
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,000
My son didn't kill anyone.

241

242

I'm warning you.

243

Back off.

244
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,380
This is the second warning.

245
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,100
He didn't kill anyone.

246
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,500
-Calm down. -He didn't kill anyone.

247
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,060
Back off!

248
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,100
The third warning.

249
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,260
-No murder. -Step back.

250
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Calm down! Back off!

251
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,380
-Back off! -Stop!

252
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,260
The village director is here.

253
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,340
He didn't kill anyone.

254
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,100
Please take a look! Help us!

255
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,290
Don't move!

256
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,100
My son didn't kill anyone.

257
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,420
They took my son.

258
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,460
My son didn't kill anyone.

259
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,300
Put that down.

260
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,060
Please save my son.

261
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,480
-My son didn't kill anyone. -They caught my son.

262
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,340
Chief Gao,

263
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm sorry about what I did just now.

264
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,890
It's okay, take a sleep.

265
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,460
I think it was Ding Dayong who broke the law.

266
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,540
His mom is innocent.

267
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,780
If we just take him away like this

268
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,060
and do not care about his parents,

269
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,540
it will be too cruel to them.

270
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,490
You've experienced it just now.

271
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,780
If you don't want to be cruel to them,

272
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,140
then you have to be cruel to your people.

273
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,570
Do you know what would have happened

274
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,100
if their village director hadn't come?

275
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,180
Sorry, Chief Gao.

276
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm too inexperienced.

277
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,160
I didn't handle it well.

278
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,540
Alright, you'll get used to it.

279
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,310
Don't run.

280
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,580
If you run, your pants that I helped you put on

281
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,740
will fall off.

282
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,530
Bro.

283
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,870
Let me interview you.

284
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,340
How dare you!

285
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,180
What were you thinking when you committed the crime?

286
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,420
You thought the police couldn't get you?

287
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,060
Shut up.

288
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,900
Can't we just have a chat?

289
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,900
No, you can't.

290
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,160
We need to record the whole process when interrogating the suspect.

291
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,950
Don't you know?

292
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,780
After we go back,

293
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,940
we'll have to hand him over to the criminal police group.

294
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,740
Just a chat...

295
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,410
Morning.

296
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,540
Morning.

297
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,340
Do you need my help?

298
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,220
No, I'm almost done.

299
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,590
I wonder how last night's action

300
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,370
is going?

301
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,250
Yeah.

302
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,500
It's so good to go on duty

303
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,460
on the first day of work.

304
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,820
Jie,

305
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,620
so early?

306
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,280
Master, you are earlier.

307
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,700
I took the shift of the instructor last night.

308
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,140
Her father is sick.

309
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,420
Is it serious?

310
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,020
It's said to be the old malady.

311
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,340
Those at her age all have elders and children to look after.

312
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,420
Chief Cheng.

313
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,860
Zhao, you're early too.

314
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,460
Not very early, Chief Cheng.

315
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,120
Well,

316
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,780
Xia Jie and I envy them a lot

317
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,860
for they could solve a case on their first day at work.

318
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,980
They?

319
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,050
What, Jie?

320
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,020
Are you jealous too?

321
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,030
I actually applied to join them...

322
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,780
That's good. Let me show you around.

323
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,010
Is there a mission?

324
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,020
Sort of.

325
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,060
Okay.

326
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,060
I'm leaving.

327
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,390
Zhao.

328
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:03,940
Chief.

329
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,290
Did I step on you?

330
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,940
No.

331
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,740
Does it hurt?

332
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,319
No.

333
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,660
So large a shoe-print! How could it not hurt?

334
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,890
It doesn't hurt, Chief.

335
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,619
Is there something you want to tell me?

336
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,740
Nothing. No.

337
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,410
Yes, I have something to tell you.

338
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,220
Come on, let's talk in the office.

339
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,740
Come.

340
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,140
Come, have a seat.

341
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,380
Sit.

342
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,020
Sit.

343
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,100
I don't need to sit, Chief.

344
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,780
What's the matter?

345
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,850
Chief, I just want to ask you

346
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,820
if all the four newcomers

347
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,210
have masters?

348
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,810
Yes, it's a tradition.

349
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
Can you be my master?

350
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
You want me to be your master?

351
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,810
Chief,

352
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,930
I've heard a lot of heroic deeds of you.

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,500
-I admire you a lot. -Oh, don't say that.

354
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,250
I've been a grassroots police officer for my whole life.

355
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,040
I didn't even make a third-class merit.

356
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,390
There's no heroic deed of me.

357
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,290
Chief.

358
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,940
You're here.

359
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,620
Instructor.

360
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,330
What’s up?

361
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,860
Nothing.

362
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,530
Haven't Gao Chao, Xincheng and others come back yet?

363
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,930
They should be back soon.

364
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,830
Did you just come back from the hospital?

365
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,750
How's your father?

366
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,620
He's generally fine.

367
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,700
With four elders at home, it must be tough for you.

368
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,260
It's fine.

369
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,580
Fine.

370
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,290
Chief,

371
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,820
I shall leave then.

372
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,770
All right.

373
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,770
Don't worry.

374
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,820
As for who will be your master,

375
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,370
just wait for the arrangement of the station.

376
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,940
We will arrange for you the most suitable master

377
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,290
to help you become the best police.

378
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,180
Then...

379
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,220
I'm relieved, Chief.

380
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,960
Alright, just rest assured.

381
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,580
We will arrange for each one of you

382
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,260
a master, okay?

383
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,900
I shall leave.

384
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,620
Go back to your work.

385
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,130
Instructor.

386
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,970
I shall leave.

387
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,300
This...

388
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,140
He wants you to be his master?

389
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,300
He wants to make progress.

390
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,090
He has a far-reaching ambition.

391
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,570
You should care more for him.

392
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,940
Of course.

393
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,860
Chief.

394
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,140
Chief Gao and his men are back.

395
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,570
Coming.

396
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,260
Of course.

397
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,700
It's easily seen as long as you have eyes.

398
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Just analyze it.

399
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,020
How could his father be sitting there,

400
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,460
right?

401
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
I'll follow up this

402
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,260
and let Captain Luo ask for credit for us.

403
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,180
We can't help them for nothing, right?

404
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,580
Chief.

405
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,670
That additionally assigned guy is not bad.

406
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,210
Who?

407
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,320
That additionally assigned guy has a quick mind.

408
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,500
He's not bad.

409
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,450
Really?

410
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,770
The car is here.

411
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,410
Jianjun, you're back!

412
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,130
Chief.

413
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,060
Jianjun.

414
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,580
Thanks for your hard work.

415
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,420
Thanks for your hard work.

416
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,680
I think you have taken

417
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,460
all the tough tasks.

418
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,780
It's all for serving the people.

419
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,900
Get off.

420
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
You even got one caught back?

421
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,560
Easy, Chief.

422
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,660
There's one more there.

423
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,680
How did you make it?

424
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,830
You got two caught at once?

425
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,020
We ran into it on the way.

426
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,330
These two

427
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,420
snatched a citizen's motorcycle

428
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,340
and were riding to escape.

429
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,740
Then we drove to get them blocked on the roadside.

430
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,640
I thought it was inappropriate

431
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,340
to just get one caught back.

432
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,750
Why not bring both of them back?

433
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,100
-Jianjun, good for you. -Who's this?

434
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,460
Cao Jianjun.

435
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,180
A well-known police hero.

436
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,310
It's just a piece of cake for Jianjun.

437
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,380
Who is better between him and Chief Gao?

438
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,870
You've hit the point.

439
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,820
Well,

440
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,870
you can later figure it out yourself.

441
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,000
I've learned from it.

442
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,140
Chief.

443
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,740
Listen,

444
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,980
don't grow complacent...

445
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,060
Be careful.

446
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,300
You're all back, right?

447
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,100
Thank you for your hard work.

448
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,940
Snatch a rest, okay?

449
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,610
Let me announce.

450
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,060
From now on, we'll leave this bed to the doctor.

451
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,070
I'm not a doctor, Chief.

452
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,490
The doctor's not local here.

453
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,750
He hasn't rented a house yet.

454
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,750
Chief, you don't have to be like this.

455
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,620
It's no need.

456
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,240
Why? Why is it no need?

457
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,500
Do you think

458
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,420
the condition is not good enough?

459
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,260
It's a bit shabby?

460
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,300
That's not what I meant.

461
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,050
Then just follow what I said.

462
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,060
All young people, snatch a break now.

463
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,580
Senior comrades, come with me.

464
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,940
Hurry up and go to bed.

465
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,250
Hurry up.

466
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,900
Couch specially for Yang Shu.

467
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,700
70 to 80 people surrounded us.

468
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,460
When I turned around,

469
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,060
Chen flew out, you know...

470
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,340
How is it, Xincheng?

471
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,090
Let me do it

472
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,620
Here.

473
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,860
We've met the newcomers.

474
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,100
Let's talk about how you feel about them.

475
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,020
Let me say first.

476
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,620
I think though the additionally assigned guy

477
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,250
always talked overmuch,

478
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,770
he's smart enough.

479
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,450
And he has great potential.

480
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,500
But the one sent by our director

481
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,760
is just a nerd.

482
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,270
You're really something!

483
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,240
How dare you make such comments on the one sent by our director!

484
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,220
Don't interpret it overmuch.

485
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,660
Chief Gao,

486
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,540
you mean Li Dawei is not bad?

487
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,740
Yes, obviously.

488
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,220
I could see it in yesterday's action.

489
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,980
Right, Chen?

490
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,780
During our action,

491
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,580
the guy looked relaxed.

492
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,380
But actually

493
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
he knew well what he should do.

494
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,820
I think he's really good.

495
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,880
He's just a bit impatient and inexperienced.

496
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,700
Yes.

497
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,920
Take the bus incident

498
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,910
yesterday morning,

499
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,700
we can see him being very vigilant and sensitive.

500
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,380
And he somewhat has worldly wisdom.

501
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,700
That's really rare.

502
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,380
I also criticized him,

503
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,980
but it was for his own good.

504
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,100
As for Yang Shu...

505
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,620
Anyhow, they are all good boys.

506
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
What comes next is how we guide them.

507
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,780
Chief,

508
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,670
I have another request.

509
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,210
I'm not capable of being a master.

510
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,940
Don't say so...

511
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,460
No, no.

512
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,820
First, I'm young.

513
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,700
Second, I'm still a disciple of my master.

514
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,900
-Listen to me. -I'm young.

515
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,940
I haven't decided yet.

516
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
I haven't decided who will be allocated disciples.

517
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,900
We're just discussing about it.

518
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,060
It's just a discussion, right?

519
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,180
Not a formal meeting, right?

520
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,770
Yes, just a discussion.

521
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,400
Then I shall go have a sleep.

522
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,840
I'm so sleepy. I didn't sleep all night.

523
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,300
Xincheng, why are you leaving too?

524
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,730
Let him go.

525
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,500
Well, Chief Cheng is not here.

526
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,580
The discussion can't be continued.

527
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,130
I'm leaving too.

528
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,970
Fine.

529
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,380
We'll talk later.

530
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,220
Zhijie.

531
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,540
Why are you still here?

532
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,490
Didn't you ask me to come?

533
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,500
The meeting is over. Go back to sleep.

534
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,100
The suspect

535
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,220
was hiding in the wardrobe in his home.

536
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,180
I could tell it at a glance.

537
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,530
Besides,

538
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,920
the side window through which Chief Gao and his men went in

539
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,540
was opened by me.

540
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,400
Awesome, bro!

541
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,260
What's my name?

542
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,280
Li Dawei, know it?

543
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,980
I envy you.

544
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,860
I really want to go to the scene like you guys.

545
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,920
There will be chances.

546
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,060
What's wrong?

547
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,420
Do you really think only he can lie on this bed?

548
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,780
There's a bed over there.

549
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,220
If you don't want to be cruel to them,

550
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,460
then you have to be cruel to your people.

551
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,990
Do you know what would have happened

552
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,600
if their village director hadn't come?

553
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,950
I'll take you

554
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,140
to get familiar with the surroundings.

555
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,620
This place has changed a lot.

556
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,210
This is the place.

557
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,370
Your dad and I found the suspect

558
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,300
on this square.

559
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,480
Your dad is ten years older than me.

560
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,990
But I couldn't catch up with him when he ran.

561
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,780
The suspect was so tall and strong,

562
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,770
being bigger than both of us.

563
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,700
But your dad suddenly pounced on him from the side,

564
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,540
making him fall down.

565
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,220
Robbery!

566
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,410
Robbery! He snatched my bag!

567
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,670
Robbery!

568
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,800
What happened?

569
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,580
Robbery!

570
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,110
Robbery!

571
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,630
Stop!

572
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,620
What happened?

573
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,460
Someone snatched my bag.

574
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,060
Get in.

575
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,090
Let's go.

576
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,220
It's right ahead.

577
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,220
Here, Miss.

578
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,860
Wait here. Watch the car.

579
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,810
Xia Jie.

580
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,660
Don't come over.

581
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,500
Don't come over.

582
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,290
Stand behind me!

583
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,040
Master!

584
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,710
Follow my order.

585
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,460
Do you hear me?

586
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,420
We got the wrong person.

587
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,300
Let's go.

588
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,410
Why don't you arrest him?

589
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,860
He has a knife.

590
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,770
Let's go.

591
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,380
So we just let him go for he has a knife?

592
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,780
After he climbs over the fence behind,

593
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
he'll have to go through a snack street

594
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,620
with continuous flows of people and goods.

595
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,030
It's not good to get yourself

596
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,700
or others hurt.

597
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,580
Xia Jie, remember my words.

598
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,500
Once you find the suspect has a weapon,

599
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,010
don't rush forward.

600
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,660
Besides,

601
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,100
never push a suspect to a dead corner.

602
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,080
Otherwise, when he finds no way out,

603
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,140
he will try desperately to fight with you.

604
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,220
Got it?

605
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,610
Did you catch up with him?

606
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,260
Did you have cash in your bag?

607
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,820
Who would carry cash when going out nowadays?

608
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,300
But my phone was in my bag.

609
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,940
How much is it?

610
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,780
Over 5,000 yuan.

611
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,700
We are from the Balihe Police Station.

612
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,380
Xia Jie, fill out a police statement for her,

613
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,740
and keep her contact information.

614
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,770
Write down her phone number.

615
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,940
What brand is your bag?

616
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:21,980
Prada.

617
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,300
Is that true?

618
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,450
This concerns the future conviction and punishment.

619
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,450
A high imitation.

620
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,300
Looks like the imitation is really of high quality.

621
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,610
The thief must have taken it for real.

622
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
-It's me. -Name.

623
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,050
Chief, go ahead.

624
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,180
-Okay, I see. -Your phone number?

625
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,380
Xia Jie, go back to the station after you finish this.

626
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,940
There's a mission for you.

627
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,820
What about you?

628
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,240
I have another mission.

629
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,450
Be careful. I'm leaving.

630
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,430
Officer, what about my bag?

631
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,250
We'll let you know when we find it.

632
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,040
Attention, all teams.

633
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,380
When we arrive at the scene,

634
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,420
be sure not

635
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,090
to fight back or scold back.

636
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,340
We must put persuasion first.

637
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,020
We must put persuasion first.

638
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,220
Please answer if you hear me.

639
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,660
Team One, roger.

640
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,420
Team Two, roger.

641
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,740
Team Three, roger.

642
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,580
Okay.

643
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,770
In my opinion,

644
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,780
it's just a trivial matter.

645
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,980
We've reported it to the higher-ups several times.

646
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,170
But it's still unsolved.

647
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,390
We should also leave it aside this time.

648
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,060
We can just give up the ranking of the next quarter

649
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,980
and let them report to the Municipal Government.

650
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Maybe by doing so can the problem be solved.

651
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,250
You don't want to wear your uniform anymore, do you?

652
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,710
Cut the crap.

653
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,100
Hand over your cat.

654
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,860
Why?

655
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,270
Our cat didn't eat your chicken.

656
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,120
It was your cat.

657
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,300
My son witnessed it.

658
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,620
Don't take your son as an excuse.

659
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,100
There are so many cats in this neighborhood.

660
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,980
Why must you say it was our cat?

661
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,380
I'm telling you, it was your cat.

662
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,940
Yes.

663
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,780
Bullshit!

664
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,960
What?

665
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,140
Calm down.

666
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,930
It was your cat.

667
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,500
Our cats are all at home

668
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,620
and never went out.

669
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,370
Unlike yours,

670
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,320
your pet cats kept running around

671
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,290
-like wild animals. -What?

672
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,600
It's yours that are like wild animals!

673
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,250
Don't fight.

674
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,260
Don't fight!

675
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,530
Fall in! Run!

676
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,380
Come here.

677
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,540
Separate the crowd first.

678
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,760
Zhijie, come here.

679
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,430
Hurry up and get the directors

680
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,630
of the Li Village and the Liu Village here.

681
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,740
These two old skates!

682
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,170
They would always hide when something happened.

683
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,180
Listen.

684
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,540
you can invite them or even tie them up.

685
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,570
Anyway, be sure to get them here.

686
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,380
Can you make it?

687
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,220
No problem.

688
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,820
Go.

689
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,220
Okay.

690
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,660
Stop it.

691
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,790
[Mom]

692
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,170
All right.

693
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,900
Back off!

694
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,140
Shut up!

695
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,620
Quiet! Back off!

696
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,900
Quiet!

697
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,360
Quiet! Back off!

698
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,050
Quiet!

699
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,260
Alright, everyone.

700
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,100
I know the situation.

701
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,300
You used to live

702
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,930
in two neighboring villages,

703
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,290
and now are living in the same neighborhood.

704
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,300
We can talk about it if there's a problem.

705
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,660
Do you have to be so extreme?

706
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,550
Let's talk nicely, okay?

707
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,590
We have nothing to talk with them.

708
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,700
We have nothing to talk with you.

709
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,300
Stop arguing.

710
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,740
Well, I got it.

711
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,380
Who lost the chicken?

712
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,020
Me.

713
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,740
My chicken is still able to lay eggs.

714
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,020
How many did you lose?

715
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,330
One.

716
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,460
Okay.

717
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,060
Xincheng.

718
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,420
Xincheng.

719
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,330
Coming, Chief.

720
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,680
Come on.

721
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,060
The chickens are here too.

722
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,730
Madam, you lost one, right?

723
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,210
I'll give you four ones,

724
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,060
including male ones and female ones, okay?

725
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,020
They're all yours now.

726
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:00,740
Really?

727
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,490
Yes.

728
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,780
Okay?

729
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,380
Thank you, Chief.

730
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,540
Thank you, Chief.

731
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,340
Thank you.

732
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,900
Look at the way she is!

733
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,420
Enough.

734
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,220
Dismiss.

735
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
No need to thank him.

736
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,690
It's not about the chicken.

737
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,140
Yes, it's not the problem at all.

738
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,730
You want to solve this problem

739
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,900
just with those chickens?

740
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,960
How is that possible?

741
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,230
You think people from the Li Village are fools?

742
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,100
Right!

743
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,340
What else do you want?

744
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,890
People from the Liu Village have pushed us too far.

745
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,820
The east district belongs to them and the west district belongs to us, it was a deal.

746
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,620
But they always came to our district to cause trouble.

747
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,620
Step back.

748
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,940
Our things have been stolen

749
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,660
once and again.

750
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,840
Who knows what will be stolen next?

751
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,530
Stop talking.

752
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,780
It was you yourselves that failed to well keep your own chickens.

753
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,980
It's none of our business.

754
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,690
Stop talking.

755
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,620
-That's right. -They offended us first but now are suing us first!

756
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,020
We also wanted to get even with you

757
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,330
about your kids' coming

758
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,260
to piss on our territory a few days ago.

759
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,050
Right.

760
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,260
Be quiet.

761
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,820
Quiet!

762
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,460
The village directors are here.

763
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
The village directors are here, stop arguing.

764
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,220
The village directors are here.

765
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,660
Hurry, village directors.

766
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,860
I have something to do at home.

767
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,100
Hurry up.

768
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,380
You two.

769
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,660
I finally got you.

770
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,620
Let's go.

771
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,390
Come on.

772
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,590
I really have something to do at home.

773
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,300
Enough.

774
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,460
This is much more important.

775
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,870
Stop it.

776
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,060
I have patients at home.

777
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:14,969
What?

778
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:15,520
Look.

779
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,139
Are you just gonna leave this aside?

780
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,810
I'm so worried.

781
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,100
Can I finish my business first?

782
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,060
No.

783
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,780
Finish this first.

784
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,130
Go.

785
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,780
Anyway,

786
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,580
both of you are leaders, village heads.

787
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,260
Chief Wang,

788
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,659
What kind of village head am I?

789
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,219
We're now living in a high building and there's no village now.

790
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,060
How can I still be a village head?

791
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:39,980
Yeah, right.

792
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,460
I haven't been in charge for so many years

793
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,739
but you insisted on letting me come.

794
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,469
I was watching a variety show at home.

795
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,050
You're wasting my time.

796
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,139
It's totally a mass here,

797
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,460
how can you still be in the mood for a variety show?

798
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:51,900
I don't know what to say.

799
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,940
Chief Wang.

800
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,600
I...

801
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,020
You asked us to deal with it.

802
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,660
We have no job, no power, and no money.

803
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,780
How can we deal with it?

804
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,500
Besides, there originally were conflicts between the two villages.

805
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,740
Why must you put them in two neighboring districts?

806
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,420
It'll be strange if nothing happens.

807
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,780
It's easy.

808
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,820
Just build a wall between the east district and the west district.

809
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,020
Cut the crap.

810
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,410
It has to be approved by the Planning Bureau.

811
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,220
Stop talking.

812
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,910
That police officer is right. Build a wall.

813
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,290
Good idea.

814
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,770
Good idea.

815
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,920
You bigmouth!

816
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,340
No one treats you as a mute if you don't talk.

817
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,180
And you.

818
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,160
Folks,

819
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,660
did you hear that?

820
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,460
The police officer said,

821
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,740
we should build a wall.

822
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,660
Let's go ask the government to build us a wall.

823
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,050
Let's follow the words of this police officer.

824
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,740
He told us to go to the Planning Bureau.

825
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,020
Let's go to the Planning Bureau.

826
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,900
Stop them!

827
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,500
Calm down, everyone.

828
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,980
Block the front.

829
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,100
No one can leave the neighborhood.

830
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,380
Build a wall!

831
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,690
Stop them!

832
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,380
It's me, master.

833
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,340
Where are you?

834
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,060
People here are gonna report it to the Municipal Government.

835
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,860
People here are gonna report it to the Municipal Government.

836
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,780
People here are gonna report it to the Municipal Government.

837
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,650
I can't go.

838
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,840
I really can't.

839
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,470
Come with me.

840
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,370
You're really...

841
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,890
I really can't.

842
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,340
You...

843
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,150
Why can't you just

844
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,750
understand it!

845
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,730
You've already been here.

846
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,860
I really can't.

847
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,180
It's okay.

848
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,860
You can comfort everyone.

849
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,980
Come on.

850
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,380
Calm down.

851
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,740
Folks! Folks!

852
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,940
Calm down.

853
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,140
Calm down.

854
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,300
Well,

855
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,930
the leader from the Planning Bureau knows your appeal.

856
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,140
So, Division Chief Xu came to meet you in person.

857
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,090
Tell Division Chief Xu if you have any questions.

858
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,140
Listen to Division Chief Xu first.

859
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,100
Folks, I’m from the Planning Bureau.

860
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,380
My surname is Xu.

861
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,020
Just call me Xu.

862
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,170
I don't care who you are. Solve the problem.

863
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,010
Can you solve the problem?

864
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,060
Be quiet.

865
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
Listen to Division Chief Xu.

866
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,820
Today, I'm going to...

867
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,260
Stop nagging and solve it.

868
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,450
Can you guarantee to solve the problem?

869
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,340
Say something.

870
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,180
Hurry up and solve the problem.

871
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,540
Solve the problem. Hurry up.

872
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,460
Hurry up.

873
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,470
Aren't you here to solve the problem?

874
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,130
Stop it.

875
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,180
What problem can I solve?

876
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,900
What can I solve as a division chief?

877
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,660
Let me tell you.

878
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,940
You can go find whoever agrees to solve the problem.

879
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,100
It has nothing to do with me.

880
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,660
Division Chief Xu,

881
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,940
you have to solve the problem for us.

882
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,860
How can you be like this as a division chief?

883
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,050
You're lying to us.

884
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,740
What are you doing here?

885
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,340
Calm down.

886
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:33,860
Stay calm.

887
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,060
Miss, don't stop me.

888
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,500
We need to leave to get the problem solved.

889
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,260
Go away.

890
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,140
That girl kept stopping me.

891
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,780
Let her go. Step back.

892
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,900
Come at me!

893
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,420
Step back.

894
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,100
I won't be against you.

895
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,380
Just let me go.

896
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,660
Stop it. From now on.

897
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,940
Calm down!

898
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,050
Help! Help!

899
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,260
What happened?

900
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,640
Someone is dying!

901
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,420
Help!

902
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,900
Help! Help!

903
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,660
Er Bao!

904
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,190
Get out of the way!

905
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,290
Take him away.

906
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Get out of the way!

907
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,740
Step back. Step back.

908
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,530
My child.

909
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,000
It doesn't matter.

910
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,100
Master.

911
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,140
It's okay.

912
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,050
Don't move.

913
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,060
Be sure not to move.

914
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,190
Yes, don't cry.

915
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,930
It's okay.

916
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,050
Where are his families?

917
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,450
What's his name?

918
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,180
Er Bao.

919
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,290
Er Bao! Er Bao!

920
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,840
Er Bao, don't be afraid.

921
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,900
Don't move.

922
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,060
Just sit there.

923
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,820
Don't move.

924
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,940
Get down!

925
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,860
Jianjun! Jianjun! Jianjun!

926
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,810
Zhijie! Zhijie!

927
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,300
Chief.

928
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,940
You two go find some ropes

929
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,900
and a ladder.

930
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,640
He's from the Li Village?

931
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,750
It's not important.

932
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,700
-Help. -I know.

933
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,010
We're trying to figure out a way.

934
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,980
We're trying to figure out a way.

935
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,690
Don't cry.

936
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,220
Calm down. Calm down.

937
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,580
Trust the police.

938
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,460
We will save him.

939
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,020
Okay?

940
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,180
Excuse me.

941
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,900
The rope is here.

942
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,780
And a ladder.

943
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,900
Excuse me.

944
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,380
Zhijie! Zhijie! No!

945
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,940
Let me do it

946
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,500
You can't go down.

947
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,060
I can make it.

948
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,780
Get a young man to do it.

949
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,500
Chief, let me go down.

950
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,060
I know how to give first aid, and I'm thin.

951
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,020
You're a girl.

952
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,930
I won't let you do it even if you know first aid measures.

953
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,740
Chief, let me go down.

954
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,380
No.

955
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,380
Xia Jie, you can't.

956
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,490
Chief, let me do it.

957
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,060
You're too tall,

958
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,700
you can only make trouble if you go down.

959
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,700
Here comes the ladder.

960
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
No, no.

961
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,660
The well is too deep.

962
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,210
It's okay.

963
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,100
Don't hurt the kid.

964
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,700
Chief, I'll go down.

965
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,740
No, Instructor.

966
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,980
You have an old injury on your waist.

967
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,620
You can't go down.

968
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,460
It's okay.

969
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,620
Why are you tying the rope on yourself, Xia Jie?

970
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,380
It's a matter of life and death.

971
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,300
There's no time, Chief.

972
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,620
Okay.

973
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,340
Be careful.

974
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,930
Yes.

975
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,700
Get it tied tightly.

976
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,140
Okay.

977
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,980
Come on, tighten the rope.

978
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,700
-Pull the rope. -Wait.

979
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,450
Xincheng, Xincheng, make way.

980
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,850
Xia Jie is going down

981
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,380
Er Bao, this sister is coming to save you.

982
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,970
Be good. Don't move.

983
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,780
Just be like that. Don't move.

984
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,860
-Come on. -Slowly.

985
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,860
Let me down a bit more.

986
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,460
A bit more.

987
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,020
Xia Jie.

988
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,940
Be careful, Xia Jie.

989
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,380
Harder. Harder.

990
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,020
-Have you gotten him? -Step back.

991
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,260
Pull the rope harder.

992
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,620
Hold tight.

993
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,010
Hold tight.

994
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,940
Is it okay?

995
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:56,740
Lower.

996
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,700
A bit more.

997
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,340
Okay, hold on to my rope.

998
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:02,940
Okay.

999
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,430
Lower.

1000
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,100
Let her down.

1001
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,500
Okay. Pull the rope harder.

1002
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,170
Okay.

1003
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,020
Don't cry. I'm here.

1004
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,700
Give me another rope.

1005
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,660
More. Slowly.

1006
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,300
One more rope.

1007
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,140
Is there another rope?

1008
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,060
Add another rope.

1009
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,100
Okay.

1010
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,500
Coming.

1011
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,130
Two more men are needed.

1012
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,780
Lower.

1013
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,900
Are you hurt?

1014
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,260
Where does it hurt?

1015
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,730
-Hang in there. -Mom.

1016
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,100
-I'll get you out of here. -Mom.

1017
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,050
Wait.

1018
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,740
It's not tied up yet.

1019
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,400
Is it done?

1020
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,500
Mom! Mom!

1021
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,340
-It's almost done. -Mom, mom.

1022
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,180
Don't worry.

1023
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,270
Mom.

1024
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,400
Come on. Pull up the rope of the boy.

1025
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,620
Pull.

1026
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,540
Slow down.

1027
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,740
One, two.

1028
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,420
It's okay.

1029
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,100
Let's go upstairs to find mom.

1030
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,380
It's okay.

1031
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,420
Pull.

1032
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,340
Okay. Pull.

1033
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,420
Be careful.

1034
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,220
Be careful.

1035
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,000
Have you gotten him?

1036
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,100
Great.

1037
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,100
Make way.

1038
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,490
Be careful.

1039
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,070
Come on.

1040
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,010
Come on.

1041
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,290
Xia Jie, come up.

1042
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,830
Okay.

1043
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,750
Hold tight.

1044
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,420
Here, Xia Jie.

1045
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,090
Coming.

1046
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:29,900
Come on. Pull.

1047
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,740
Come on.

1048
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,460
Slowly.

1049
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,980
Okay, thank you.

1050
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,490
Thank you.

1051
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,220
How is it?

1052
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:47,860
Thank you.

1053
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,530
Well done, Xia Jie.

1054
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,610
Not bad.

1055
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,580
It's nothing.

1056
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,570
Your face is a bit...

1057
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,980
Look at her.

1058
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,820
She got so dirty. Thank you.

1059
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,910
Chief.

1060
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,890
Some things really need to be done by girls

1061
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,550
for girls have their advantages.

1062
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,300
Come, wipe your face first.

1063
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,260
Thank you, Chief Wang.

1064
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,740
And thank

1065
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,620
all the police officers of the Balihe Police Station.

1066
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,460
Yes. Thank you.

1067
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,300
Thank you.

1068
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,220
Don't thank me.

1069
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,440
I still have to persuade you.

1070
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,550
I really hope the two villages

1071
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,420
can get along well in the Sunshine Community.

1072
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,150
Yes.

1073
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,150
Could this

1074
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,740
really work?

1075
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,020
Head Li,

1076
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,470
why are you so stubborn?

1077
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,830
Alright.

1078
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,420
Li,

1079
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,980
the police

1080
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,580
saved our child.

1081
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,420
If you keep doing this,

1082
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,060
it will make you look like a hard man.

1083
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,860
I won't.

1084
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,340
Chief Wang, how about this?

1085
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,020
We two will persuade the villagers, okay?

1086
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,490
Okay.

1087
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,500
We'll do the work.

1088
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,860
Me too.

1089
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,100
That's right.

1090
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,180
Let's applaud to thank them.

1091
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,780
Thank you.

1092
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,510
Bravo!

1093
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,180
Okay.

1094
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,860
Mom, why did you call my leader again?

1095
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,830
If I hadn't,

1096
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,610
I wouldn't have known that

1097
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,720
you suffered so much outside.

1098
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,980
Come back home, hurry.

1099
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,540
Let's quit it.

1100
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,690
Let's leave the Balihe police station.

1101
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,620
I shall call Director now.

1102
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,690
♫Rosy clouds up above painted in sunset♫

1103
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,910
♫Warriors return to their camp after they finish shooting♫

1104
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,100
Cadet Li Dawei is reporting to you.

1105
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:52,820
Let's eat.
