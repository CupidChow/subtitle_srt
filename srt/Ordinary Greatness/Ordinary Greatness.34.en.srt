00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,070
Master, you're finally back.

7
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,770
Did you find anything?

8
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,790
He hasn't come back, right?

9
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,500
No.

10
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,610
I went in

11
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,670
and walked

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,579
some distance.

13
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,020
The footprints disappeared.

14
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,900
Why don't we wait here

15
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,660
and go in to find after he leaves?

16
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,900
Forget it. We'll come back tomorrow morning.

17
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,600
Okay.

18
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
Are you okay?

19
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,020
Fine.

20
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,880
Let's go back.

21
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,780
Officer Zhang.

22
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,340
We've checked.

23
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,540
This person

24
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,870
also committed a crime in our jurisdiction.

25
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,820
He's one of our targets.

26
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,740
Our bureau wants

27
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,980
to deal with this person.

28
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,890
No way.

29
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,740
This man has committed a series of burglaries in our place.

30
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,540
But our chief

31
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,700
told us so.

32
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,940
He committed crimes in your place.

33
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,740
But we caught him here.

34
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,180
We have to keep him.

35
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,220
Hello, this is Wang Shouyi.

36
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,890
What is it?

37
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,470
I'm still up.

38
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,250
Zhijie, tell me.

39
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,820
What?

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,720
We've almost solved the case.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,250
Do they want to take advantage of it?

42
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,190
If Qi Bei keeps the man,

43
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
how can we close this case?

44
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,100
Chief.

45
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,450
What? They won't let him go?

46
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,160
Qi Bei wants to keep him?

47
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,470
Then... we should hand over all the

48
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,410
cases to them.

49
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,500
What do you mean?

50
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,730
The aim of no burglary for 100 days.

51
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,180
We only have one.

52
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,300
If they

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,340
take over all the cases

54
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,930
he committed,

55
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,660
we will...

56
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,670
Zhijie.

57
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,780
Well, okay.

58
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,710
Tell them we agree

59
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,140
to let them keep him.

60
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,940
We not only agree to keep him here,

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
we'll also bring

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,350
all the files of cases he committed in Pingling

63
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,580
to them.

64
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,620
You only need to hand over

65
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,330
and come back as soon as you're done.

66
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,780
Okay, that's it.

67
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,240
Well, well. Chief Cheng.

68
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,860
At this critical moment,

69
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,460
you have so many wicked ideas.

70
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,620
What?

71
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,990
I'll give you another idea.

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,440
Ask the cook to come up

73
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,780
to get enough people to upgrade.

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
Upgrade? What upgrade?

75
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,300
Look at the situation.

76
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,260
Play chess with me.

77
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,390
You go back now.

78
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,780
Go back. It's cold outside.

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,500

It looks like we're going to celebrate the Spring Festival on the way.

83
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,700
You can take advantage of it.

84
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,390
The highway is free today.

85
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,580
Master, since the highway is free today,

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,530
I'll charge.

87

Chief, I can do it myself.

You've seen through my scheme.

148

Chief, let me pour it for you.

149
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,780
OK.

150
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,860
Zhao, let me pour it for you.

Yes. It's the Spring Festival, after all.

I think I can go home tonight.

Don't wait for me.

Why are you waiting for me?

Have fun, you hear me?

Dress warmly when you go out.

Hello?

How is it?

168
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,560
Did Jiajia enjoy the Spring Festival?

169
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,620
She spent it at Xia Jie's house.

170
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
She even asked to sleep in the same bed

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,190
with Xia Jie at night.

172
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,540
Come on. She just likes to join the fun.

173
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,060
Xia Jie likes her.

174
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,700
Yes.

175
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,260
It can be said that

176
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,150
I watched Xia Jie grow up.

177
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,860
The child is really nice.

178
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,420
What do you mean?

179
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,820
Am I not good?

180
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,580
What does it have to do with you?

181
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,550
Yes.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,120
Do you

183
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,440
like Xia Jie?

184
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,740
Do I?

185
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,620
Stop asking.

186
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,460
Let me tell you.

187
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,400
If you really like her,

188
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,660
you have to tell her about your feelings.

189
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,340
Do you hear me?

190
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,670
Don't hide it.

191
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
After I separated from

192
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,610
Jijia's mom,

193
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,900
I learned that.

194
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,100
But it's useless. It's too late.

195
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,650
Is it here?

196
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,060
Get off and have a look.

197
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,530
It seems to be here.

198
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,020
Dawei, this should be

199
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,790
where illegal loggers and poachers live.

200
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,540
Let's go over there.

201
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,620
Yue Wei

202
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,460
wouldn't have come to such wilderness

203
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,180
in the middle of the night for no reason.

204
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,570
And now it's during the Spring Festival.

205
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,510
There must be something wrong here.

206
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,770
Remember this place.

207
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,420
We may come again.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,790
Okay, let's go.

209
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,020
The new year has passed.

210
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,490
The anti telecom fraud special campaign

211
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,420
is about to begin.

212
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,120
This time,

213
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,740
the Criminal Investigation has also guided our station to set up a special task force.

214
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,130
Chief Gao will be the leader and select the personnel.

215
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,940
If anything happens,

216
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,140
report to the special task force in time.

217
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,520
Chief, I'll select the personnel.

218
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,100
This time,

219
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,820
I want two young men.

220
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,780
Li Dawei.

221
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,660
Here.

222
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,940
Zhao Jiwei.

223
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,900
Here.

224
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,020
Master.

225
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,300
Cheng, you...

226
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,100
Don't look at me like that.

227
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm not grabbing your disciples.

228
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,900
They're still yours.

229
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,780
But this time,

230
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,650
I want two young and strong men

231
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,400
and two old but vigorous ones

232
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,480
to give me some advice.

233
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,860
Wait.

234
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,460
Old but vigorous? What do you mean?

235
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,290
You're the old one.

236
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,220
Zhijie, your disciple...

237
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
That's right. You...

238
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,050
Chief is old and vigorous.

239
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,370
Why do you get me involved?

240
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,210
But I really have some feelings.

241
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,980
The times change so quickly.

242
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,620
We can't catch up with them.

243
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,740
Do you know what?

244
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,980
When I became a policeman,

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,080
I taught the people

246
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,450
how to avoid telecom fraud.

247
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,590
I said

248
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,300
we should be alert.

249
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,820
We shouldn't believe in other people's fine words.

250
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,540
Now,

251
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,340
they've been tricked out of all their money,

252
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,500
but where are the swindlers?

253
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,420
We don't even know that.

254
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,060
However,

255
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,050
justice will prevail over evil.

256
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,220
So everyone must work hard.

257
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,700
We'll work hard.

258
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,620
OK. Let's wind up the meeting.

259
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,300
Dawei.

260
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,020
I've told you

261
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,490
I wanted two young men.

262
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,550
Go to the police station with me.

263
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,260
Okay.

264
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,490
Wait for me downstairs.

265
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,740
I'll be right down.

266
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,540
-Okay.
-Okay.

267
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,330
-Captain Luo.
-Both of you.

268
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,180
Happy Spring Festival.

269
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,260
I'm here to pay a new year call.

270
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,300
I'll also pay a new year call.

271
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,300
I heard you had gone to Northeast China.

272
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,690
Did you find anything?

273
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,480
It's cold.

274
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,300
Dawei was almost frozen to death.

275
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,020
What's up, Captain Luo?

276
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
You know our whereabouts very well?

277
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,820
What?

278
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,700
You still haven't given up on the clue of Yue Wei?

279
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,900
This brat

280
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,390
came back from the northeast on the first day of lunar year.

281
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,510
By the way,

282
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,620
there are indeed some doubts.

283
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,180
Well,

284
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,140
he hasn't been home for so many years.

285
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,280
If he wanted to be home for the Spring Festival,

286
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,820
why did he rush back

287
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,220
on the first day of lunar year?

288
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,420
If he didn't go home for this,

289
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,500
why did he go back

290
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,730
from afar?

291
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,130
Is it possible that he's in a rush

292
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,080
for the free highway on the first day of lunar year?

293
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,660
After all, he drives an unofficial car.

294
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,570
Maybe.

295
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,180
We collected all surveillance videos

296
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,160
about him together.

297
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,060
You can take a look.

298
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,660
Okay.

299
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,140
He usually

300
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,190
drives the unofficial car without making troubles.

301
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,620
When he's free,

302
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,680
he'll enjoy himself in entertainment places.

303
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,220
There's nothing unusual.

304
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,380
Captain Luo,

305
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,890
didn't anyone

306
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,050
report a missing person before the Spring Festival?

307
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,980
No.

308
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,090
But it doesn't mean no one went missing.

309
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,460
As you know,

310
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,710
the turnover of women working in that kind of place

311
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,850
is very high.

312
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,100
Besides, during the Spring Festival,

313
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,100
many people left without saying goodbye

314
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,490
to go home for the festival.

315
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,830
The boss would know their quitting

316
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,140
until they didn't come back after the festival.

317
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,060
As long as the boss and their family didn't report the case,

318
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,300
even if someone really went missing,

319
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,420
we can't confirm it.

320
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,330
We can only wait.

321
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,380
Captain Luo,

322
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,780
although we didn't find

323
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,810
any valuable clue

324
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,650
for the trip to the northeast,

325
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,390
we've become more suspicious

326
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,460
about this person.

327
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,180
He must have something to hide.

328
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,940
Anyway, let's pay close attention.

329
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't worry.

330
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,120
It takes patience

331
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,060
to operate a case.

332
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,090
Yes.

333
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,380
Master, this is interesting.

334
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,860
Captain Luo

335
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,300
used a word,

336
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,300
"operate".

337
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,590
Look.

338
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,460
From the beginning, we find a clue,

339
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,710
then a suspect,

340
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,050
and then we find more clues

341
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,140
through the suspect.

342
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,740
And we find all the people involved

343
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,380
and see the whole case clearly.

344
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,380
Then we distinguish the connection between

345
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,810
the principal criminal and accessory and other relationship of criminals.

346
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,300
Then the operation of the case can be finished.

347
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,580
At last we solve the case at one fell swoop.

348
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,640
In the whole process,

349
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,420
some take it

350
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,860
as a project they operate.

351
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,500
But

352
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,300
I don't like this word.

353
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,020
I'm afraid I'll get used to it and forget

354
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,020
what we face

355
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,610
are not just impersonal cases,

356
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,330
but also real people.

357
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,130
Master, I'll keep it in mind.

358
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,940
I won't use this word anymore.

359
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,660
Okay, go in.

360
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,500
Zhao Jiwei,

361
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,060
tell me about the situation you've sorted.

362
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,170
Okay, Chief Gao.

363
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,060
We've received a total of

364
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,500
32 cases of telecom fraud.

365
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,620
There are only two cases solved.

366
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,540
The money has been transferred.

367
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,930
They didn't get the money back at all.

368
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,500
For the rest cases, the swindlers couldn't be found,

369
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,580
or they're already overseas.

370
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,930
Dawei,

371
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,780
tell me what you think.

372
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,430
There's one thing in common in these cases,

373
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,540
that is, cheating with high interest.

374
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,010
Speaking of cheating with high interest,

375
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,490
there's no distinction between the world and the people.

376
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,580
Everyone can be fooled.

377
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,230
If people aren't greedy,

378
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,670
they won't be cheated.

379
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,970
You're talking about future education.

380
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,950
I'm asking you the current situation.

381
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,170
Chief Gao.

382
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,140
I think we should

383
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,730
categorize these cases

384
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,290
and start with simple ones.

385
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,690
Is there a simple one?

386
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,100
Which is simpler?

387
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,560
-Chief Gao.
-What?

388
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,900
110 just transferred a case.

389
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,820
Someone called the police from abroad,

390
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,260
saying that someone will broadcast her suicide

391
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,380
in our jurisdiction.

392
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,140
Our jurisdiction?

393
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,660
Yes.

394
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,460
Since he's abroad, how did he know?

395
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,090
The reporter called from America.

396
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,220
He said he saw this on Weibo.

397
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
He said the girl wanted to commit suicide

398
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,500
and posted a photo of herself.

399
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,700
He got a some information from a girl through private chat.

400
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,420
He thought it's very likely that she's in our jurisdiction.

401
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,910
He's still chatting with the girl

402
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,780
to stall for time,

403
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,610
hoping we can find the girl as soon as possible.

404
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,000
How about this?

405
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,370
Send the photo to each team

406
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,700
and tell the netizens

407
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,480
to find a way

408
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,550
to get this girl's phone number.

409
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,030
Okay.

410
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,700
Go.

411
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,310
Respond to the report. We need to save her.

412
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,390
All teams, search your jurisdictions respectively.

413
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,940
This is 038. This is 038.

414
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,420
Please keep in touch with the netizen who called the police,

415
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,380
because the suicide has built

416
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,460
initial trust with him.

417
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,610
Keep him in contact with the suicide

418
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,500
and try to stall for time.

419
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,540
Got it.

420
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,020
Master,

421
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,090
what's going on now?

422
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,780
We couldn't find the swindlers when dealing with fraud cases.

423
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,230
Now, there's a person who wanted to jump off a building.

424
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
But we don't know where she is.

425
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,150
Attention, all teams.

426
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,260
The scope of the suicide has been confirmed.

427
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,870
We need to search the exact location.

428
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,980
Master, we are the closest to this area.

429
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,180
Master. Master.

430
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,820
The station called.

431
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,260
They contacted the website

432
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,900
and sent the girl's address

433
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,740
on Weibo.

434
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,380
She really wants to commit suicide.

435
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,220
Xinxing Garden?

436
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,460
What?

437
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,330
Xinxing Garden.

438
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,220
How did you know?

439
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,780
038 is reporting. 038 is reporting.

440
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,950
The location of the suicide

441
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,710
should be between Building 22 to 25

442
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,570
in Xinxing Garden.

443
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,980
She's on the top floor.

444
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,870
We'll give the exact location as soon as possible.

445
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,460
Over.

446
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,500
How did you know so much about that?

447
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,860
Was this neighborhood in that year...

448
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,690
Yes.

449
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,410
Right there.

450
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,450
Look.

451
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,710
There's a TV tower next to this building.

452
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,750
This is the coordinate.

453
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,450
Hello, is this Manager Yuan from Xinxing Garden?

454
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,480
This is Chen Xincheng from Balihe Police Station.

455
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,780
Please inform Captain Wu

456
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,740
of the neighborhood security team right now.

457
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,970
Bring more security guards.

458
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,690
You bring some property managers, too.

459
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,340
Wait for me at the west gate of the neighborhood.

460
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,250
We'll be there soon.

461
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,570
Master, should we inform the fire brigade?

462
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,320
Yes.

463
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,340
But we can't absolutely confirm

464
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,250
the location of the suicide yet.

465
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,260
But we need to keep close contact with the fire brigade.

466
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,600
Dawei,

467
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,660
this Xinxing Garden neighborhood

468
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,660
is an old one.

469
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,970
It's not easy for firefighters to get in there.

470
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,460
By then,

471
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,900
it's more dependent on us.

472
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,330
038. 038.

473
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,100
Can you confirm the target is in Xinxing Garden?

474
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,570
We'll confirm it as soon as possible.

475
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,020
038. 038.

476
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,930
The others are approaching you.

477
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,640
Please be careful.

478
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,220
038 got it.

479
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,620
-Hello, Officer Chen.
-Hello.

480
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,100
Sir, what's the matter?

481
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,190
This way.

482
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,510
Master.

483
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,270
Is someone really going to jump?

484
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,280
Up there.

485
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,170
It's so high.

486
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,040
Master, what should we do?

487
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,980
Dawei, report to the command center

488
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,310
and tell them about the situation here.

489
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,950
Ask them to send firefighters here immediately.

490
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,620
OK.

491
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,900
You guys

492
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,160
evacuate the roads here immediately

493
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
and evacuate the crowd,

494
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,890
especially the elderly and children.

495
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,580
And immediately evacuate

496
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,400
the vendors and retailers

497
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,530
on our way here.

498
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,070
Ensure the smooth road.

499
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,330
The fire brigade will be here soon.

500
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,070
Make sure they can come to the rescue successfully.

501
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,220
OK. Go.

502
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,140
OK. Let's go.

503
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,860
Master, the fire brigade has set off.

504
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,630
OK.

505
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,130
Dawei, go upstairs with me.

506
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,710
OK.

507
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,070
In such a short time,

508
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
she posted another three things on Weibo.

509
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,500
They're respectively for her parents, her nephew

510
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,220
and her cat.

511
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,340
Master, I think she just met a liar.

512
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,570
She told her nephew

513
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,790
not to trust others when he grows up.

514
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,900
Let go of me!

515
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,040
Don't move!

516
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,510
We want you alive.

517
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,890
Let go of me!

518
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,110
She told her cat

519
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,710
that only her cat had never lied to her.

520
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,980
Master,

521
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,300
the reinforcements from the station will arrive soon.

522
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,740
Shall we wait?

523
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,690
That girl looks heavy.

524
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,820
Stop it.

525
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,300
Don't come over!

526
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,720
-If you come closer, I'll jump down right now.
-No, no, no! Miss!

527
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,220
We won't go over there.

528
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,910
Miss, can you tell us

529
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,080
what happened?

530
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
Why did you do that?

531
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Tell us.

532
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,930
Maybe we can help you.

533
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,410
No.

534
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,130
No one can help me.

535
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,350
I'm saying goodbye to this ugly world.

536
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,110
Don't disturb me.

537
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,140
Okay. Okay.

538
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,550
We won't say that.

539
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,620
But I want to remind you.

540
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
You'd better not jump now.

541
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,660
Look downstairs.

542
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,660
There are many old people and children.

543
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,500
If you jump down now,

544
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,180
you might hit them.

545
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,740
Many innocent people will be hurt or die.

546
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,660
Since you choose to do this,

547
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,460
you must have been hurt.

548
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,540
So you don't want to hurt others anymore,

549
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,170
right?

550
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,670
It looks like

551
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
he disclosed the news to you.

552
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,180
So ugly.

553
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,910
I thought before I pass away,

554
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,710
I can trust the last person.

555
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,540
I didn't expect to be fooled again.

556
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,540
You mean the netizen in America?

557
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,850
Miss, he called the police

558
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,090
to help you.

559
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,260
You can't treat other people's kindness as a lie.

560
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,160
I don't want to hear it anymore.

561
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,300
I'm tired.

562
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,860
Let me enjoy my last peace.

563
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,540
-OK? OK.
-Sure. Sure.

564
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,940
But please promise us

565
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,220
not to jump now.

566
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,580
We'll evacuate the crowd first.

567
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,660
Dawei, quickly make a call

568
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,020
and inform them to evacuate the crowd.

569
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,710
Ask where the fire brigade is.

570
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,810
Where is the fire brigade?

571
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,790
There's just me and my master.

572
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,940
Yes. Yes.

573
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,380
The situation is not optimistic.

574
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,240
Tell them to hurry up.

575
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,980
Okay.

576
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,880
Okay.

577
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,760
I saw it.

578
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,910
The support from the station is here.

579
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,420
Where is the person?

580
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
Chief Gao, the jumper is upstairs.

581
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,970
Chen and the others have gone up.

582
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,180
OK.

583
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,740
The fire brigade is still on the way. A few minutes.

584
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,530
Master.

585
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,000
She's so calm.

586
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,700
Maybe she won't jump?

587
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,780
No.

588
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,140
The more emotional you are,

589
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,100
the less you'll act imprudently

590
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,990
in a short time.

591
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,000
Look at her now.

592
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,400
She must have made up her mind

593
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,310
and may jump down at anytime.

594
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,200
Master, our men are here.

595
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,610
I saw the warning line outside.

596
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,170
That means

597
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,110
she knows

598
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,980
if she jumps down now,

599
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,140
she won't hurt anyone else.

600
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,880
Thank you.

601
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,710
Thank you.

602
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,540
To be honest,

603
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,020
I was a little scared just now.

604
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,960
But now I'm not afraid at all.

605
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,390
Master, it's too late.

606
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,260
Let me do it.

607
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,540
I've seen your Weibo.

608
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,860
Miss,

609
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,700
I've read the words you posted recently.

610
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,530
There seems to be a problem.

611
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,230
Listen to me.

612
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,580
You seemed very thoughtful.

613
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,840
You said goodbye to your parents,

614
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,850
your nephew

615
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,090
and even your kitten.

616
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,030
But you forgot a key detail.

617
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,620
You didn't tell them

618
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,790
why you took this step?

619
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,500
Have you thought about your parents?

620
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,170
I'm also a father.

621
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,300
I have a daughter

622
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,320
She's not much younger than you.

623
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,860
Your parents have raised you for more than 20 years.

624
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,020
In the end,

625
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,620
you choose to end your life

626
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,730
in this way

627
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,650
and let them, the older one, send the younger.

628
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,610
No.

629
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,480
I don't want to explain.

630
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,330
I can't explain to them.

631
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,100
No need to explain.

632
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,900
No need to explain, silly girl.

633
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,140
Explain what?

634
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,530
You just need to

635
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,810
give your parents an account.

636
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,850
After all, they've raised you for more than 20 years.

637
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,460
Shouldn't they know

638
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,150
what you are going to do?

639
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,420
Here, Dawei.

640
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,700
Here, lend your phone

641
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,730
to this girl.

642
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,540
Give them a call

643
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,460
and explain the reason.

644
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,940
It's just about few words.

645
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,730
We won't go there.

646
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,620
Here.

647
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,480
Come and get it yourself.

648
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,850
Yes.

649
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,220
Stop looking. Stop looking.

650
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,260
In this case,

651
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,860
they won't live in

652
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,510
guess and guilt in the rest of their lives.

653
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,220
Let go of me!

654
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,570
Let me go! Let me die!

655
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,850
I don't want to live! Let go of me!

656
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,330
Let go of me!

657
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,060
Let go!

658
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,220
Li Dawei, hang in there.

659
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,730
Master, tell me

660
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,230
what should we do

661
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,890
if she drags us down?

662
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,940
No.

663
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,250
No.

664
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,670
Let me help you up.

665
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,440
This girl met

666
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,810
a typical trap called pig-butchering scam.

667
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,900
The swindlers set a trap.

668
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,909
Then they call the target

669
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:14,810
the pig.

670
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,719
They have enough time to raise the pig.

671
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,780
When the pig grows fat, they'll kill it

672
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,679
and run away.

673
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,699
This is the pig-butchering scam.

674
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,100
This girl is Wu Yu.

675
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,139
She looks ordinary and is fat,

676
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,449
and feels inferior.

677
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,270
She never found her ideal boyfriend.

678
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,659
Fortunately, her father

679
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,560
left her more than one million yuan

680
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,340
and two properties.

681
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,900
After her father passed away,

682
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,659
a man in his thirties

683
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,940
entered her life

684
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,699
and dated her.

685
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,380
And he cared about her

686
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,730
like a father.

687
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,060
When she spent

688
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,940
almost all the inheritance

689
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,210
on her boyfriend,

690
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,620
this man suddenly changed his attitude.

691
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,179
After humiliating her,

692
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,130
he disappeared.

693
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,889
Wu Yu felt hurt

694
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
and was distracted.

695
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,230
Later, she registered and

696
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,580
uploaded her personal information on a dating website

697
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,770
called Long Distance Romance.

698
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,180
She wanted to find another boyfriend.

699
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,900
Someone responded soon.

700
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:02,990
This is the photo.

701
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,770
According to the registration information,

702
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,100
this man is Tian Gaoping.

703
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,000
He's from Haiming County.

704
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,730
He said he's born into a military family.

705
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,460
He worked hard

706
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,730
and had a mobile phone repair shop in this county.

707
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Wu Yu

708
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,130
was not confident in her appearance,

709
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,140
and was once hurt by the relationship,

710
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,860
so she didn't ask much from her boyfriend.

711
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,260
So this little boss just

712
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,860
fit her expectation.

713
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,770
Most importantly,

714
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,040
he showed his love for Wu Yu.

715
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,420
He was gentle and considerate,

716
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,080
and sympathized

717
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,190
Wu Yu’s past.

718
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,090
He often told Wu Yu something like that.

719
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,660
"You've suffered a lot."

720
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,660
"When we are together,

721
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,820
I'll protect you."

722
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,250
"I won't let anyone hurt you."

723
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:40,970
In that case,

724
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,500
Wu Yu was very touched.

725
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,060
The boss also told Wu Yu

726
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,220
that he didn't have much money

727
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,020
and couldn't give her a better life.

728
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,420
Wu Yu told him

729
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,700
she had money and houses.

730
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,140
She told him her wealth directly.

731
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,500
The boss said,

732
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,100
"how could you tell your wealth

733
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,380
to others so casually?"

734
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,700
"Your money and your houses are yours."

735
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,670
"Don't tell anyone,

736
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,540
including me."

737
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,290
When Wu Yu heard that,

738
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,520
she thought she found the right person.

739
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,360
Then they started dating.

740
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,740
Did they meet each other?

741
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,740
Impossible.

742
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,610
The characteristic of the pig-butchering scam

743
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,020
is that both parties would never meet each other.

744
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,830
What's wrong with young people nowadays?

745
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,330
They're dating

746
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,900
without even seeing each other?

747
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,060
Chief, you don't understand that.

748
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,870
Do you know what is ambiguity?

749
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,340
Do you know what is vagueness?

750
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,330
It's fun not to see each other.

751
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,340
You know everything.

752
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,380
Ambiguity? Vagueness?

753
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,940
Do you want to do this too?

754
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,100
No.

755
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,730
They have never met

756
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,900
or chatted on video.

757
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,750
He just left a QQ number.

758
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,890
This man

759
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,940
communicated with her

760
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,910
through QQ voice messages.

761
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,210
He would send some videos occasionally.

762
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,260
But they were all

763
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,940
about his life and surroundings.

764
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,180
He didn't show up

765
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
in the videos.

766
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,380
According to what he told Wu Yu,

767
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,860
he wanted to create a sense of mystery

768
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
for this relationship.

769
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,470
This mysterious feeling

770
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,030
was exactly what Wu Yu wanted,

771
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,870
because this girl was fat.

772
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,070
She didn't want her boyfriend

773
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,380
to see her like this.

774
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,900
You know?

775
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,460
Then,

776
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,860
after they kept in contact for four months,

[Photo of Tian Gaoping on social media.]

778

Wu Yu felt

779
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,760
she had been deeply in love with that man.

780
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,990
But for those who made the pig-butchering scam,

781
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,940
at this time,

782
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,360
the pig was almost raised.

783
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,740
The show would start soon.

the probability is too low?

787
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,380
But he has an internal relationship.

788
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,590
What relationship?

789
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,320
He said

790
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,780
his uncle is an internal staff

791
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,060

who can get internal information.

793
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,270
But this is illegal.

794
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,490
So he didn't tell anyone.

795
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,380
He accidentally said it

796
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,180
because we had a good chat.

797
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,450
I guess he was too careless.

798
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,230
And? He asked you to buy it too?

799
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,890
He didn't ask me to buy it.

800

I did it voluntarily.

801

He always won.

802
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,260
He would buy me some gifts after winning.

803
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,450
I was very touched.

804
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,380
And then?

805
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,490
This girl

806
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,490
couldn't help

807
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,800
but find this man.

808
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,550
She wanted to buy some lottery tickets

809

and hit the jackpot through his relationship.

810
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,660
She invested 100,000 for the first time,

and got 120,000.

813
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,880
Wu Yu received the money

814
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,020
and thought it's more reliable than depositing it in the bank.

815
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,990
So she asked the man to continue buying it for her.

But the man

817

00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,170
to sell a house,

848
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,980
I actually suspected him.

849
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,900
I told him

850
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,420
when we got married,

851
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
we could take this house as our wedding house.

852
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,160
I didn't want him...

853
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,710
I didn't want him to suffer

854
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,300
for buying the house to marry me.

855
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,270
But he told me

856
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,550
he must give me a home.

857
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,120
This was his promise to me.

858
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,080
So he must buy the wedding house himself.

859
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,290
I was so touched.

860
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,100
I even...

861
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,760
I even felt ashamed

862
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,870
because I had suspected him.

863
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,730
Besides, he told me

864
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,300
this was a rare opportunity.

865
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,610
So I sold the house my dad left for me

866
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,870
behind my mom's back.

867
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,280
What opportunity?

868
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,220
Tian Gaoping

869
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,810
said the website needed maintenance.

870
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,300
He could do something

871
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,020
during the maintenance

872
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,860
with his uncle

873
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,940
and make a fortune.

874
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,260
He even swore to Wu Yu

875
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,580
if she invested the three million yuan after selling the house,

876
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,660
he promised she would get the double rewards.

877
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,300
three million yuan after selling the house.

878
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,530
And more than one million

879
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,460
earned by the lottery tickets

880
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,300
with the help of the man in more than two months.

881
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,260
She made all of them.

882
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,180
And then?

883
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,740
He told me

884
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,680
it would take two days for the maintenance.

885
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,920
I didn't contact him

886
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,670
in these two days.

887
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,290
But two days later,

888
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,430
I didn't have any news about him.

889
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,830
I sent him messages on QQ

890
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,310
but found that he had blocked me.

891
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,700
When I went to the website,

892
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,210
I found that I couldn't log on it.

893
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,950
Then I realized

894
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,370
I was cheated again.

895
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,570
This girl

896
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,830
was cheated in the real life.

897
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,740
In order to seek comfort,

898
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,100
she chose to make friends online.

899
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,490
But she was cheated again.

900
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,290
And it's worse than the first time.

901
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,140
So the girl

902
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,140
lost faith in

903
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,610
the world and

904
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,700
people in this world.

905
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,150
Since you have money,

906
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,250
why did you borrow money from a loan shark?

907
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,660
I didn't borrow it.

908
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,490
He borrowed it.

909
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,760
He borrowed it?

910
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,280
What does it have to do with you?

911
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,480
But we are a couple.

912
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,180
He told me

913
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,760
something went wrong with their company.

914
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:16,990
There's cash-flow problem.

915
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,640
I said I could lend you money,

916
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,140
but he said he couldn't use his girlfriend's money.

917
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,180
He must find a way to borrow money.

918
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,300
He just wanted me to do him a favor.

919
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,150
What favor?

920
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,920
He wanted me to be his co-signer.
