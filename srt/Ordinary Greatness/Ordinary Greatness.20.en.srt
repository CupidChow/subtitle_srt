5
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,140
Chief Cheng,

6
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,550
Sorry, guys.

7
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,180
Come on.

8
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,620
It's okay.

9
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
I told you not to wait for me.

10
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,610
The dishes were just ready.

11
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,259
Have a seat.

12
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,979
Come on.

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,380
I'm out of breath.

14
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,820
-I'm alittle out of breath. - Come on. Wait.

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,140
One for each.

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,980
Wipe your hands.

17
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,300
You're so particular.

18
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,140
My wife gave it to me.

19
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,730
A sense of ritual.

20
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,460
She will check it every day when I'm back home

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,220
to see if it is used or not.

22
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,130
We should have gathered a long time ago.

23
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,650
I remember we had a gathering

24
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,750
when I first joined the police station.

25
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,770
It's been years.

26
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,450
You're not objective.

27
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,460
Wasn't the police station gathering every year during the Spring Festival?

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,960
Chief Cheng, you are really something.

29
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,670
I'm talking about us.

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,840
You weren't the Chief then.

31
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,990
Gao Chao and I just came here.

32
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,450
Yes.

33
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,220
I didn't know what we were busy with all day.

34
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,980
Maybe we just didn't have the same spare time.

35
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,620
Right?

36
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,060
It's not easy to get together.

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,220
Chief Cheng,

38
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,460
do you have anything to say?

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,180
Just say it.

40
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,050
What can I say?

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,190
Just like what Jianjun said,

42
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,750
we haven't gathered for a long time.

43
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,110
And the four of us

44
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,530
have a common identity.

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,940
We are all masters.

46
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,740
Jia.

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,980
Jia.

48
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,700
Xia Jie.

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,020
You wait till she finishes her online class.

50
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,260
My master told me

51
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,300
Chief Cheng invited four of our masters

52
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,060
to have dinner today.

53
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,670
Why are you so gossipy?

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,460
Was it because

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,060
my master irritated Officer Chen?

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,300
Why?

57
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,620
Why do you have so many questions?

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,500
I just asked the first question.

59
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,260
Officer Chen protected Dawei.

60
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,380
My master

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,980
protected me.

62
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,100
Zhijie is different.

63
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,980
He was a master of two people.

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,620
He was also Gao Chao's master.

65
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,460
What do you mean?

66
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,060
Am I an old master?

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,090
Of course.

68
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
A teacher for a day is a father for life.

69
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,060
Look at Chen and Chief Cheng.

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,460
You all have apprentices, right?

71
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,670
And

72
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,110
the one who left a few years ago.

73
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,780
He said Liu Wei.

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,160
I have a bad memory.

75
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,300
Anyway, this is my first time being a master.

76
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,459
We are so busy

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,420
even if

78
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,420
we meet at the police station every day.

79
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,980
It's rare to gather together.

80
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,300
Let's drink tea instead of wine. Cheers.

81
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,500
Come on.

82
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,180
Chen.

83
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,010
What should we do now?

84
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,659
What do you mean?

85
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,900
I had thought about it before I did this.

86
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,500
I'll take the responsibility.

87
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,360
I won't implicate you.

88
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,820
What are you talking about?

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,310
Let's not talk about us first,

90
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,700
but now we're dragging our masters into this.

91
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,140
These are two different problems.

92
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,020
Let's talk about us first.

93
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,540
For I, Dawei and Zhao Jiwei,

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,720
all three of us were photographed.

95
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,900
If they want to hold us accountable,

96
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,740
no one can escape.

97
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,770
It looks like I'm completely hopeless to become a regular employee.

98
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,940
Speaking of which,

99
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,570
I got you involved first.

100
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,630
The problem now is the masters.

101
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,930
Chen, come on.

102
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,980
I'll do it myself.

103
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,860
Braised pig's trotters.

104
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,420
They said it was good. Try it.

105
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,470
Not bad, Chief Cheng.

106
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,620
We haven't eaten together for so many years.

107
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,740
You still remember that Chen loves pig's trotters.

108
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,460
You also remember it, don't you?

109
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,860
I'm working in the community.

110
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,230
I have to pay attention to all aspects of life.

111
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,100
Not only do I remember Chen loves pig's trotters,

112
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,140
but you don't eat chicken.

113
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,460
I still remember Jun likes to eat spiced beef,

114
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,580
right?

115
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,980
You're really something.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,020
Come to think of it,

117
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,130
it was also the time that I first joined the police station.

118
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,850
Why am I so nostalgic lately?

119
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,900
That time we went

120
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,230
to catch a drug dealer.

121
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,020
There were 16 or 17 hours without eating or sleeping for us.

122
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,520
There happened to be a spiced beef restaurant next to it.

123
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,940
It smelled so good.

124
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,610
I was so craving it.

125
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,880
After the mission completed,

126
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,230
my master bought one for me.

127
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,160
It was amazing.

128
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,650
I still couldn't forget that taste now.

129
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,460
Since then,

130
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,380
whenever someone mentioned

131
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,690
the words "spiced beef",

132
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,780
I had no resistance at all.

133
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,420
Really?

134
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,820
Here, spiced beef.

135
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,650
Get out.

136
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,020
Look.

137
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,700
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

138
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,450
Are we really getting old?

139
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,530
I've been nostalgic lately.

140
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,409
I brought Zhao Jiwei to the neighborhood recently.

141
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,690
When I looked at him,

142
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,940
I thought of the time when I was young.

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,420
He's so calculating

144
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,050
exactly like the original me.

145
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,860
Come on, Chen. Do you need to refill some water?

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,720
As you all know,

147
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,400
I came from the countryside.

148
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,060
I joined the army first

149
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,330
and became a police officer.

150
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,500
Jiwei took the examination and went to the police academy.

151
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,020
It was not easy

152
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,860
from the countryside to the city.

153
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,860
So he cherished

154
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,580
the current and stable work so much.

155
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,650
It's like

156
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,000
Sister Lin went into...

157
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,300
Grand View Garden.

158
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,220
No, Jia's Mansion.

159
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,090
He was afraid of making mistakes

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,240
that made his job lost.

161
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,500
So he had to be careful and care about everything.

162
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,620
I understand.

163
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,380
Jiwei is very thoughtful.

164
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,580
He also can understand the difficulties of the people.

165
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,780
It's only been a few months.

166
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,420
He's gradually on his way.

167
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,620
Anyway, Jiwei has made great progress.

168
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,500
That's right.

169
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,220
When I saw his progress,

170
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,020
it reminded me that I got an improvement

171
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,020
little by little at that time.

172
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,020
Yang Shu is the same.

173
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,220
He always looks stubborn.

174
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,580
He always go against me and fight with me.

175
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,500
But he

176
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,580
is really well-meaning.

177
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,500
He really hopes

178
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,560
to solve the people's problems

179
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,860
as much as possible.

180
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,810
Don't you think it's weird?

181
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,700
I don't believe it at all.

182
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,700
After we kept arguing like this,

183
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,130
somehow,

184
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,960
it seemed that we really had a little master-apprentice relationship.

185
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,980
It's the feeling of husband and wife, isn't it?

186
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,340
A young couple's quarrel?

187
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,450
Yes, that's right.

188
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,020
Chen. Chen.

189
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
Have some, Chen.

190
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,210
You eat some.

191
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,850
Come on.

192
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,780
Jiwei.

193
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,460
When we arrived,

194
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,420
we had stopped Dawei.

195
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,140
None of us started the fight.

196
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,620
He started it.

197
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,500
It's the truth.

198
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,710
But we had no evidence to prove

199
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,450
we were self-defense.

200
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,179
Probe.

201
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,620
Yes.

202
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,260
Then I'll check the area nearby

203
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,020
if there is any surveillance camera.

204
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,300
If there is,

205
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,380
we can definitely prove

206
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,820
we didn't do it first.

207
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,540
This was just a fistfight.

208
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,510
It's useless.

209
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,890
You think about it.

210
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,500
He was the villain who complained first.

211
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,180
If he uploads the video

212
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,020
on the Internet,

213
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,810
the people won't think about it and would take the first impression.

214
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,860
If this made a scene in the bureau,

215
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,070
who would care about the details?

216
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,740
If you say so,

217
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,090
there's no hope for us.

218
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,220
I've worked hard for so long.

219
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,220
Because of my carelessness this time, I have lost everything.

220
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,220
When we gave up using legal weapons

221
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,890
and chose to use our fists,

222
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,180
we had already lost.

223
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,600
We had lost to "The Police Law"

224
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,100
and lost the principles

225
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,060
as a police officer.

226
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,650
Yang Shu, don't you think

227
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,130
your words are contradictory?

228
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,540
On one hand, you said we didn't fight first.

229
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,340
On the other hand,

230
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,100
we had lost by putting down our legal weapons.

231
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,530
These are two different aspects of the problem.

232
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,900
First one is the reality,

233
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,850
Second one.

234
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,940
Enough. It's not the time

235
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,540
to talk about theoretical things.

236
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,500
Legal weapons?

237
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,820
Just for his thing,

238
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,980
how long can the law sentence him?

239
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,100
The key is that everyone will know about it.

240
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,540
How big a psychological shadow would Jia have?

241
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,380
We have principles,

242
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,850
but we have no choice.

243
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,300
This is what an ordinary man should do.

244
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,970
Why can't the policemen do it?

245
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,740
I don't believe it.

246
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,140
Our voluntary actions against injustice

247
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,700
can't defeat that shameless old man.

248
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,900
Jia, don't think too much.

249
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,580
We are fine.

250
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,980
What should I think about?

251
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,560
Nothing.

252
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,870
I want another cup of Coke.

253
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,130
I'll buy it for you.

254
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,120
Xia Jie, how about you ask the Chief

255
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
if becoming a regular employee has anything to do with this?

256
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,020
Actually, I understand

257
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
what you just said.

258
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,680
Zhao Jiwei

259
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,700
has indeed improved a lot.

260
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,140
And Yang Shu.

261
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,720
Yang Shu is indeed a good kid.

262
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,700
Xia Jie is even better.

263
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,100
Among these four people,

264
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,330
Li Dawei has the most problems.

265
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,300
Maybe it's because I have many problems.

266
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,060
Chen, you think too much.

267
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,100
Is that all you want me to say?

268
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,700
Yes, Brother Chen.

269
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,140
We didn't mean anything.

270
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,540
I just took Jiwei to the community this afternoon

271
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
and saw his progress.

272
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,810
I was touched just now.

273
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,340
That's all.

274
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,300
I just said it casually.

275
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,210
Yes.

276
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,980
Chen, me too.

277
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,330
Two days ago,

278
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,100
I worked with Yang Shu on a small case a few days ago.

279
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,340
Suddenly,

280
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,500
somehow I found we developed

281
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,900
such a tacit understanding.

282
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,500
I just said it out loud without reason.

283
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,900
Yes, I didn't mean anything else.

284
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,420
It's just a gathering and chatting today.

285
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,760
Don't think too much.

286
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,810
Just talking about Li Dawei,

287
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,700
everyone can see his ability.

288
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,060
You thought the chief criticized him.

289
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,030
Actually, I think

290
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,380
the Chief

291
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,660
thought highly of him.

292
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,500
Yes.

293
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,470
Really?

294
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,130
No, no, no.

295
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,650
I don't mean anything else.

296
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,400
I was just

297
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,220
very touched

298
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,860
and a little sad.

299
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,640
At first, I thought

300
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,460
Li Dawei and I

301
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,380
had emotions.

302
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,020
But when I looked at everyone,

303
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
it was the same.

304
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,380
People are really connected.

305
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,470
But for that matter,

306
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,050
don't worry.

307
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,740
Anyway,

308
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,020
it was all caused by me.

309
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,540
Whether my apprentice

310
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,340
or other masters,

311
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,220
don't worry and I won't implicate you.

312
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,700
Actually, I've thought about it.

313
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,060
I've been a policeman

314
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,900
for half of my lifetime.

315
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm a little tired.

316
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,820
I just take off my uniform

317
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,220
and will not have worries anymore.

318
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,660
Chen, stop talking nonsense.

319
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,220
You sit for a while.

320
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,250
I leave first.

321
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,720
Chen! Chen!

322
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,940
Chen! Chen!

323
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,300
Calm down.

324
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,530
What are you doing?

325
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,770
How can you take off the uniform

326
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,400
as you want?

327
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,300
Besides, even if you take it off,

328
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,020
what will you do for the rest of your life?

329
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,250
Besides, if Jia finds out,

330
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,500
what would she think?

331
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,860
Have you thought about it?

332
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,920
Chen.

333
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,780
Alright, stand up.

334
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,460
You...

335
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,280
I asked you to take physiotherapy, but you said you were busy.

336
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,640
I don't know how long your waist can support.

337
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,530
When you can't stand up,

338
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,810
what will you do?

339
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,220
What should I do?

340
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,380
I have you.

341
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,740
What if I retire?

342
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,620
You...

343
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,740
How could you retire?

344
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,300
I see

345
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,540
you're always busy.

346
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,610
There are more people you communicate with than our policemen.

347
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,420
Besides,

348
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,740
why are you so optimistic?

349
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,660
How did you train?

350
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,980
No matter if I cry or laugh, I have to live.

351
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,660
Why not laugh?

352
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,050
The more people I got to know,

353
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,940
I realized there were more good people.

354
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,620
There are no bad people.

355
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,420
Only sick people.

356
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,980
You're right.

357
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,300
There are so many people in our jurisdiction.

358
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,590
But those who committed crimes

359
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,620
were only around 0.0 percent.

360
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,620
There are many good people.

361
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,090
Of course.

362
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,940
It's inevitable that there are some despicable people.

363
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,370
The policemen always punish the evil and promote the good.

364
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,140
That's why there are many bad people in their views.

365
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,620
Doctors cure patients,

366
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,760
so we see many patients.

367
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,220
We both want the world to be better.

368
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,390
We're in the same boat.

369
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,060
Same path.

370
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,650
You are almost a philosopher.

371
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,100
In the future,

372
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,820
I'll come here often.

373
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,620
One is to heal my body.

374
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,620
and another one

375
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,900
is to cleanse the soul.

376
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,660
Come on.

377
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,340
When you're not busy,

378
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,500
and I'm also not busy,

379
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,050
let's sit down and have a drink.

380
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,660
Okay.

381
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,190
Let's talk about the world and human sentiment.

382
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,100
Maybe we have many common languages.

383
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,170
Now that you mention it,

384
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,580
I feel ashamed.

385
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,050
We've known each other for so many years.

386
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,820
I've been here for physiotherapy.

387
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,210
I never said

388
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,460
we could sit somewhere

389
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,260
and have a drink.

390
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,500
I'm flattered.

391
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,180
How about this?

392
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,060
I'll treat you

393
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:52,940
when we take a rest.

394
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,940
I know a steamed seafood restaurant

395
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,610
which is very good.

396
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,340
No, thanks.

397
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,860
I don't eat such high-class food.

398
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,420
You know,

399
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,140
I grew up starving since I was a child.

400
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,740
My biggest dream

401
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,859
is to eat a big pot of pork head in one go.

402
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,540
I'll treat you next time.

403
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,970
There's a restaurant with pork face that smells good.

404
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,700
Okay, let's pick pork face.

405
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,579
Okay, pork face.

406
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,880
Chief, you're back.

407
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,420
Yes.

408
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,180
He's here again.

409
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,180
He's waiting for you in your office.

410
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,570
He got anxious.

411
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,620
He will be invincible

412
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,380
if he's shameless.

413
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,620
How about this?

414
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
I'll get changed and you go upstairs with me.

415
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,280
Chief.

416
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,950
Dispatch!

417
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,820
Chief.

418
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,740
Look at his face.

419
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
That tough guy is coming again.

420
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,830
Zhao Jiwei, back off!

421
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,570
Xia Jie, don't move.

422
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,500
How many times have I said this?

423
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,260
I keep talking about it which can blow bubbles.

424
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,980
Why don't you understand?

425
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,500
Till now, I can't get rid of

426
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,380
this matter.

427
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,500
So let me bear it alone.

428
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,320
It's meaningless

429
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,710
to get you involved, understand?

430
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,620
If the matter needs someone to bear,

431
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,740
We'll bear it together.

432
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,160
No.

433
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,540
You're all infected by Yang Shu, right?

434
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,380
All of you are so stubborn.

435
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,540
Chief Gao, just say it if you have something to tell.

436
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,740
If you insist, just come.

437
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,140
Chief Gao.

438
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,980
Chief Gao.

439
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,420
What are you doing here?

440
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,220
I've been looking for you.

441
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,340
Are you hiding here?

442
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,300
What are you plotting?

443
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,100
Nothing.

444
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,380
No.

445
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,980
You lied to me, didn't you?

446
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,380
Are you waiting for this?

447
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,260
Have a look at it by yourselves.

448
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,550
Li Dawei, what's going on?

449
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,780
Brother. Brother.

450
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,660
It has nothing to do with him.

451
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,460
Let me tell you.

452
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,700
I saw our Chief's previous grand style

453
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,420
was back today.

454
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,560
When he hit the table,

455
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,660
the shock, logic and problem

456
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,330
are so airtight.

457
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,700
Sit down.

458
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,690
Chief Gao, show him.

459
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,660
Don't you want evidence?

460
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,630
I think you've improved.

461
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,570
You smell good.

462
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,260
Chief Gao.

463
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,770
Let him watch it again.

464
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Don't you want evidence?

465
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,380
You smell good.

466
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,430
Watch carefully.

467
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,060
What are you doing?

468
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,900
Don't touch me!

469
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,010
I will tell my mom.

470
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,660
You explain to him.

471
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,350
How can his behavior be called?

472
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,660
Mr. Yu,

473
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,740
your behavior was called sexual harassment.

474
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,840
You sexually harassed your stepdaughter.

475
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,970
Do you know

476
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,120
how you will be sentenced based on the law?

477
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,500
Do you want me to teach you?

478
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:07,860
Well...

479
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,660
How did you get that video?

480
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,690
-Chief. Chief. -The video.

481
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,090
Jia gave me the video.

482
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,060
Yes.

483
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,460
She said she was encouraged

484
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,300
due to brothers' and sister's brave.

485
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,010
She has to stand up bravely to help you.

486
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,620
Xincheng.

487
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,140
Jia is not a simple girl.

488
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,220
She also said

489
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,580
if Yu

490
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,820
kept going,

491
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,220
she would sue him

492
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,020
and fight against him.

493
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,650
A little girl could say that.

494
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,820
I appreciate her courage.

495
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,800
Jia is braver than we thought.

496
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,740
Master, good news.

497
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,970
Jia is great.

498
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,510
Zhao Jiwei, what are you doing here?

499
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,780
I can't bear to see others crying.

500
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,020
You can't and so do I.

501
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,180
I'll cry if you keep crying.

502
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,290
I'll cry for you.

503
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,130
Fine.

504
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,980
What are you stirring up?

505
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,540
Enough.

506
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,780
-What did you cry for? Don't cry. -Chief.

507
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,700
It's so lively.

508
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,660
What are you rehearsing?

509
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,750
Is everyone here?

510
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,580
Yes.

511
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,860
Alright, sit down.

512
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,640
Have a meeting.

513
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,860
Chief,

514
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,020
what you said just now

515
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,260
was too affectionate.

516
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,340
I was so touched.

517
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,210
So affectionate.

518
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,460
That part was very affectionate.

519
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,060
Are you all happy?

520
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,250
What are you happy about?

521
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,740
You four, stand up!

522
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,050
You were still laughing after you made such a big scene.

523
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,110
Why are you laughing?

524
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,860
How can you laugh?

525
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,580
As police officers

526
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,100
which are the symbol of the country's law,

527
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,420
you only knew the punch when you were in trouble.

528
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,180
Do you still want to be a police officer?

529
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,900
Do you still want to wear this uniform?

530
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,510
You've only been in the station for a few days.

531
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,980
Everyone in the station

532
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,180
worried about you.

533
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,520
Chief.

534
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,420
Why are you standing up?

535
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,570
You know I'm going to blame you?

536
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,100
An old police officer with over 20 years of working experience

537
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,370
didn't think before you got into trouble?

538
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,100
You were so stubborn.

539
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,660
How did you guide your apprentice?

540
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,540
After something happened to Li Dawei,

541
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,420
he was impulsive and didn't think over it

542
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,940
which he learned all from you.

543
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,620
You are really a good master.

544
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,820
Chief,

545
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,820
you are right.

546
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,340
I promise

547
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,610
I won't do it again.

548
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,490
We promise

549
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,800
this won't happen again.

550
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,630
Chief, I promise.

551
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,370
Me too.

552
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,620
I promise.

553
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,580
Chief,

554
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,580
we can write a self-criticism

555
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,500
as long as you can

556
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,850
calm down.

557
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,860
We can write 10,000 words of self-criticism.

558
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,010
100,000 words will also be okay.

559
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,150
Only you can write, right?

560
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,900
Look at you.

561
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,670
For this kind of violation,

562
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,980
if you do it again,

563
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,060
you will leave immediately.

564
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Do you remember what I said?

565
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,540
Yes.

566
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,050
Then you get out of here

567
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,690
as early as you can.

568
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,340
Yes.

569
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,500
For your masters, stay here.

570
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,500
Usually,

571
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,820
you keep talking about the principle and discipline.

572
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,990
But when it was required to obey the principle

573
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,980
and discipline,

574
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,180
all of you

575
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,080
are blinded by this emotion.

576
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,060
Each of you had person emotions

577
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,370
and heavy burdens.

578
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,530
It seems that this is a master-apprentice relationship,

579
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,420
but you actually put your willingness

580
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,540
above principles and discipline.

581
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,450
An example is better than a precept.

582
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,570
What's the use if you can't make it yourself?

583
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,060
What's the use?

584
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,490
A master and an apprentice

585
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,780
is not enough to

586
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,810
rely on emotions and justice.

587
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,380
You should set an example

588
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,870
and tell the youngsters

589
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,100
what their responsibilities are.

590
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,380
Tell the youngsters

591
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,930
what the identity of a police officer means.

592
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,780
What's the honor of a police officer?

593
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
As a law executor,

594
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,620
the first priority is to restrict yourself

595
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,650
and hone your willpower

596
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,660
and endurance.

597
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,260
Okay. I'm done.

598
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,350
Instructor, say something.

599
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,340
All of you here are veterans.

600
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,420
You should know

601
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,770
what we are carrying.

602
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,900
What we are carrying

603
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,620
is to maintain social security

604
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,740
and to protect the people.

605
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,220
This mission requires us

606
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,300
to put the interests of society, country and people

607
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,620
be the top priority.

608
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,500
This kind of mission also requires us

609
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,060
we can't be

610
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,900
like ordinary people who are led by their emotions.

611
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,260
So you must remember

612
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,060
to serve the people as our aim,

613
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,490
to improve your Party spirit,

614
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,470
and to promote the spirit of self-sacrifice

615
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,390
for the sake of

616
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,010
the great self.

617
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,340
Well, would it be too good for him?

618
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,620
Jia is soft-hearted.

619
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,860

00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,060
Hello, mom.

714
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,100
What's going on? I'm working.

715
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,260
What did you say?

716
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,100
I see.

717
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,380
Okay, I'll go back.

718
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,580
Master, can I take a leave?

719
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,340
I need to go home.

720
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,820
Did something happen?

721
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,740
I'm sorry.

722
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,860
I can't tell you now.

723
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,780
Can I go back?

724
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,460
Okay, you go back.

725
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,330
Wait.

726
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,310
Go to the station and change your uniform first.

727
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:06,880
Okay.

728
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,570
Go ahead.

729
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,300
Mom.

730
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:13,900
Mom!

731
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,340
Mom.

732
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,340
Dawei. Dawei.

733
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,420
What happened?

734
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
Why are you crying?

735
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,980
It's okay, mom.

736
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,460
I'm here even if the sky falls.

737
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,820
Tell me, what happened?

738
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,190
The brain glioma.

739
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,940
I didn't want to tell you.

740
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,970
I accompanied him to several hospitals.

741
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,630
They all said it was this disease.

742
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,300
Where is he?

743
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,480
He went out to play with his friends.

744
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,220
He went out to play with his friends?

745
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,100
Mom, what does he take you for?

746
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
No wonder why he came back time time.

747
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,420
He said he would not leave once he was back.

748
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,740
He wanted us to help cure him and live for the rest lifetime, right?

749
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,870
Is there such a person?

750
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,430
Dawei, he is your dad.

751
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,340
What's wrong with my dad?

752
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,930
All bastards in the world don't have sons

753
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,840
and don't be a father.

754
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,900
He wants to extort me just because he gave birth to me?

755
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,660
No way.

756
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,450
Son.

757
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,050
Son.

758
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,750
Brain glioma is incurable.

759
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:47,910
This...

760
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,080
Is it good or malignant?

761
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,300
It is not good or malignant for this disease.

762
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,650
It's incurable.

763
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,780
Besides,

764
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,490
the tumor is so big.

765
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,570
No wonder.

766
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,420
Is there such a person in the world?

767
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,130
Son,

768
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,820
When he was sick, he enjoyed eating and playing

769
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,190
and caused trouble for us.

770
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,940
He came back to think of us when he got sick.

771
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,860
Is there such a good thing?

772
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,940
I'll talk to him.

773
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,140
Son, you can't...

774
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,740
You can't do this.

775
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,940
Okay, I'll call him

776
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,900
I'll make it clear to him.

777
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,940
No, you...

778
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,500
He's your father.

779
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,780
You can't do this.

780
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,120
He has an incurable disease now.

781
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,320
He needs our comfort.

782
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,050
What? He needs comfort?

783
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,130
Who's comforting you?

784
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:44,660
You...

785
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
I need comfort too.

786
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,500
I'll talk to him.

787
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,420
Listen to me. You can't do this.

788
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,900
Son.

789
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,280
I called your dad back.

790
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,900
I called him back

791
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,140
because I knew he got sick.

792
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,700
I did it voluntarily.

793
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,560
What did you say?

794
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,580
I did it voluntarily.

795
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,830
Son,

796
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,980
you didn't understand.

797
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,600
In fact, your dad

798
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,820
was very important in my mind.

799
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,330
Mom,

800
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,390
haven't you been cheated enough by him in your life?

801
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,050
No.

802
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,390
Didn't you hate him

803
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
and want a divorce?

804
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,610
Yes, I...

805
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,340
I hated him.

806
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,690
I hated him for not going home.

807
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,500
But he's back now.

808
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,660
Well...

809
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,860
What do you want me to say?

810
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,230
Son,

811
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,429
I like your dad.

812
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,870
I've loved him all my life

813
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,670
which hasn't changed till now.

814
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,449
Son.

815
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,300
Son.

816
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,980
although you don't like your father,

817
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,590
you are like him.

818
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,969
I'm not like him,

819
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:47,860
am I?

820
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,179
When you were young,

821
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,250
other kids

822
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,130
wanted to win first place.

823
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,810
What about you?

824
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,860
You didn't care even if you got a zero in the exam.

825
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,570
And other kids followed the rules

826
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,020
and discipline.

827
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,700
What about you?

828
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,120
broke the rules and teachers looked for your parents every day.

829
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,060
You lived a comfortable, happy

830
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,430
and vivid life.

831
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,660
These are all given by

832
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,220
your father.

833
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,270
Son,

834
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,870
you have your father's strength.

835
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,540
But

836
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,530
you're more responsible than him.

837
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,050
I have you because of your dad.

838
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,370
I'm always grateful to him.

839
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,500
But now he has an incurable disease.

840
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,340
I don't know how long he can live.

841
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,730
In this world,

842
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,100
I only have you now.

843
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,140
Mom, don't cry.

844
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,020
He's back.

845
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,710
Take care.

846
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,660
Cuiping.

847
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:28,940
You're back.

848
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,570
I bought you

849
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,250
your favorite mutton soup.

850
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,450
Really?

851
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,860
Dawei is back.

852
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,040
At this time,

853
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,920
we should treat him actively.

854
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,460
I believe, based on the current development of science,

855
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,110
maybe

856
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,780
medicine can solve this problem.

857
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,780
Listen to your son.

858
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,300
I'm not going to cure.

859
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,350
What did you say?

860
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,130
When I was running outside,

861
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,220
I went to several hospitals.

862
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,900
Even a big hospital in Singapore.

863
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,020
A foreign doctor told me that I didn't need treatment.

864
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,970
Since I had it,

865
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,360
just enjoy my life.

866
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,650
You're still enjoying life?

867
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,100
Haven't you had enough?

868
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,140
Have you ever been responsible?

869
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,860
You haven't been responsible.

870
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,050
You are still irresponsible after you are sick.

871
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,260
What should my mom and I do?

872
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,100
You have an incurable disease.

873
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,900
We won't treat you

874
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
and we will just watch you die.

875
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,780
Son.

876
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,860
It's settled.

877
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,290
Listen to me.

878
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,580
I'll arrange a hospital for you.

879
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,180
You have to treat

880
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,300
whether you want or don't want.

881
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,860
You've never been responsible.

882
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,260
Can you take responsibility this time?

883
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,190
You left without treatment.

884
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,430
What do you want my mom to do?

885
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,660
Son,

886
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,770
Just

887
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,650
do as your father wishes.

888
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,900
Mom.

889
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,770
Son.

890
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,980
I went to several hospitals with your dad.

891
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,040
It can't be cured.

892
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,740
If it goes on,

893
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,210
your father will suffer and

894
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,510
we will suffer too.

895
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,370
Mom, if he didn't even treat the disease

896
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,060
and you just died,

897
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,020
you would think of it in the future...

898
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,220
I'm not scared

899
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,360
because I have you.

900
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,830
As long as your dad

901
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,450
is happy every day, I'm fine.

902
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,140
Son,

903
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,000
I've discussed it with your dad.

904
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,770
I have some savings now.

905
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,730
Instead of

906
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,200
paying the money to the hospital,

907
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,930
why don't we take a walk around

908
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,210
when your dad is healthy?

909
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,580
-Mon, this thing... -Stop it. That's it.

910
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,610
When your dad chased me,

911
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,860
he always bragged that

912
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,700
he had traveled all over the world

913
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,480
and he would take me to travel the world

914
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,520
after he pursued me.

915
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,150
Wherever he went,

916
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,100
he would take me to go there one more time.

917
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,860
After that, he was out alone.

918
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,040
I was busy at home.

919
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,320
Now God

920
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,650
has arranged a time for us

921
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
to realize our dreams when we were young.

922
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,440
It's here, son.

923
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,070
The cruise is really nice nowadays.

924
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:20,970
Right?

925
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,630
It's as stable as the ground.

926
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,340
My cruise at that time

927
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,900
was small and suffocating.

928
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:28,900
Great.

929
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,130
Let me take a photo for you.

930
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,620
Here.

931
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,660
Mom, is this okay?

932
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,910
If something happens to him,

933
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,300
can the medical conditions on the ship keep up?

934
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,410
It's fine.

935
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,300
I know my own health.

936
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,830
In other words,

937
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,780
one day,

938
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,290
it's quite romantic

939
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,190
to be thrown and buried into the sea.

940
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,770
Don't talk nonsense.

941
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,590
You have to come back with me.

942
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,670
Okay.

943
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,790
Mom, sit down and have a rest.

944
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,630
OK.

945
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,460
-Let me take photos for you and your mom. Come on. -Okay.

946
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,620
Here, son.

947
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,240
Okay.

948
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,470
Mom, come back early.

949
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,730
Don't forget I'm here.

950
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,740
You...

951
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,460
I don't care. You've grown up.

952
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,810
The rest of the time...

953
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,130
Li.

954
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:10,850
Yes.

955
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,780
The remaining time

956
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,130
is me and your dad.

957
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,640
Okay.

958
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:16,850
Okay, sit here.

959
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,870
Let me take some photos for you.

960
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,440
-Okay. -Okay.

961
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,270
Come on.

962
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,720
Take this.

963
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,640
Go back.

964
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,610
Drive slowly.

965
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,220
Take more videos.

966
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,840
I'll wait for you.

967
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,580
Take care of the belongings.

968
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Take some photos.

969
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,010
Take care.

970
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,330
See you.

971
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,080
Be careful.
