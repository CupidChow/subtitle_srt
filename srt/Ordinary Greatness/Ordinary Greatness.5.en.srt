5
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,180
Tell me.

6
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,050
How long have you sold yourself?

7
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,080
Stop dreaming since you are here.

8
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,630
I've told you many times about the policy.

9
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,220
Your future depends on your choice.

10
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,130
Not long ago.

11
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,630
Not long ago?

12
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,840
Then why there was the crime in Zhuma Alley last year?

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,620
Behave yourself!

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,060
How long have you been selling yourself here?

15
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,300
How much is it once?

16
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,080
Be honest with me.

17
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,980
Don't take any chances.

18
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,050
Say it!

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,920
Xia Jie.

20
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
What's wrong, Jie?

21
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,990
Are you not feeling well?

22
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,780
How about going to the infirmary?

23
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,300
No.

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,200
Then what's up?

25
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,010
Just say it.

26
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,610
Master.

27
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,430
what you did just now

28
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,910
was disrespecting and humiliating a woman.

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
Even if she committed a crime,

30
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,370
before the public trial,

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,730
she is also a legitimate citizen.

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,960
You should at least respect her.

33
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,530
I thought you were sick.

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm glad you're okay.

35
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,860
Dou, come here.

36
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,420
I'm asking a female suspect.

37
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,170
Come in and help me.

38
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,900
Jie, take a rest.

39
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,860
Master.

40
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,990
It's okay. We'll talk later.

41
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,370
Here.

42
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,890
Girl.

43
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,060
Xia Jie.

44
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,320
What's the matter?

45
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,840
Nothing. I brought her back.

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,600
What are you doing?

47
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,330
Don't do anything stupid.

48
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,420
Be honest about your matter.

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,209
Let me tell you.

50
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,940
If you are innocent,

51
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,339
the sooner you make it clear,

52
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,140
the earlier you can leave.

53
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,410
Xia Jie, if there's nothing else,

54
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,540
you can get back to work.

55
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,260
My daughter is only seven years old.

56
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,909
My husband has never took care of her by himself.

57
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,570
Please.

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,730
Call my husband.

59
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,140
Hello, mom.

60
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,940
Are you feeling better?

61
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,230
Much better.

62
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,290
The medicine is on the tea table. Remember to take it.

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,980
When are you coming back?

64
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,980
I'm quite busy today.

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,390
I don't think I can go back.

66
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,700
You can't go back?

67
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,340
You've only been on the job a few days,

68
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,330
then Cheng Hao asked you to stay up all night?

69
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,620
Mom, you don't know how much

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm been taken care of in the police station.

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,630
Chief Cheng didn’t ask me to do anything.

72
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,300
That's what he should do.

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,159
But I'm also a policewoman.

74
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,710
I need to exercise and study too.

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,780
You can't stay up late to study.

76
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,480
How did your dad train them back then?

77
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,260
Mom,

78
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,210
I have something to do. I have to go.

79
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,730
How can I have dinner without you?

80
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,500
There is beef and vegetables in the fridge I bought yesterday.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,660
Maybe you can cook some?

82
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,610
How can I cook only for myself?

83
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,420
Forget it. Leave me alone.

84
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,540
I'm not eating.

85
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,020
How can you not eat?

86
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,860
What do you want to eat?

87
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,010
I'll order takeout for you.

88
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,860
The takeout is not clean.

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,940
It's so oily.

90
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,860
Do I dare to eat it?

91
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,040
How about going out and eat something?

92
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,580
If you really care about me, come back early.

93
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,220
If you can't come back earlier, stop talking.

94
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,860
Mom.

95
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,580
Chief.

96
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,260
Why are you here?

97
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,420
Please sit.

98
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,260
What happened?

99
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,590
When Yang Shu said you didn't go back to the station,

100
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,460
I thought you must have come here

101
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
to work on the kid who jumped.

102
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,520
Somebody have to deal with the aftermath.

103
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,220
Jianjun,

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,940
when it comes to the boldness and cautiousness,

105
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,380
no one can compare to you.

106
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
But,

107
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,490
I still want to talk about you.

108
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,260
Chief,

109
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,940
I know what you want to say.

110
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,790
This is exactly a special case.

111
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Even so, you should wait for the fire brigade.

112
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,860
I'd been waiting.

113
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,100
But they said there was a traffic jam.

114
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,820
It would took an hour to clean the road.

115
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,340
The kid suddenly got emotional.

116
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,620
I had no choice.

117
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,220
Jianjun,

118
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,140
Think about what happened to Xincheng.

119
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,180
It's a small probability event.

120
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,740
Don't find an excuse.

121
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,659
How many times have I told you that

122
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,080
you can't act on your own in such situation?

123
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,260
If you can't,

124
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,179
I'll punish you if you do this again.

125
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,549
You don't have to do that, do you?

126
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,570
Why not?

127
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,350
I punish you for your own good.

128
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,980
Jianjun,

129
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,930
Think about it.

130
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,020
You're with your wife and child now.

131
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,460
You live in a happy life.

132
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,780
That's great.

133
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,420
If something happens to you,

134
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,900
just like Xincheng

135
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,640
who has been separated from his wife and child.

136
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,420
Hello.

137
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,300
Officer Xia.

138
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,220
Why are you here?

139
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,340
How is the child?

140
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,660
Officer Xia, how is my wife?

141
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,050
She's suspected to be unlawful,

142
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,020
and is under interrogation and investigation.

143
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,380
Officer Xia,

144
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,280
you called me to pick up my kid,

145
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,610
so I knew

146
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,530
my wife and I met a kind person like you.

147
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,450
My wife had no choice

148
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,820
but to work here.

149
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,230
At my age,

150
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,170
I couldn't find a good job in the city.

151
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,680
I've found a few jobs but didn't get paid.

152
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,660
My wife has to support our family.

153
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,420
At this point,

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
I can only tell you to believe in the law.

155
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,140
Officer Xia, as you can see,

156
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,370
my wife has been taking care of the child.

157
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,680
I didn't do it at that time.

158
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,150
Since she is in prison now,

159
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,420
I don't know what to do.

160
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,980
Can you give her a message?

161
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
What is it?

162
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,250
Here you are, Li.

163
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,900
- Dad.
- Li!

164
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,980
- You scared me!
- Mom.

165
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,270
Thank you, officer.

166
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,370
Thank you very much.

167
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,700
It's okay. It's my duty.

168
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,340
It's okay.

169
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,260
Take care of the kid.

170
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Thank you so much.

171
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,100
Take care, sir.

172
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,450
Walk slowly and watch the steps.

173
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,460
Sign it first.

174
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,460
You can have a good sleep at home.

175
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,740
Sit here for a while.

176
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,980
Don't run around again, kid.

177
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,100
Here.

178
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,300
Sit here. Watch out.

179
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,700
You need to improve your safety awareness.

180
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Thank you, Officer Xia.

181
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,740
Turn right, turn right.

182
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,100
Xia Jie.

183
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,500
We just interrogated the criminals

184
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,580
They'll be sent to jail.

185
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,220
We need a female police officer in the cars. You follow one.

186
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,460
They're going to jail so quickly?

187
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,980
It's a big case that the district bureau pays attention to.

188
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,100
The district bureau needs more force to interrogate them there.

189
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,180
We don't have enough force here.

190
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,890
Hurry up.

191
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,860
Xia Jie, sit here and eat.

192
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,340
Sir, give me two drumsticks.

193
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,010
Okay.

194
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,150
Thank you.

195
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,780
Xia Jie.

196
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,540
I have something to do.

197
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,620
I need to talk to you.

198
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,280
Hurry up. Don't dawdle.

199
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,700
Jie, what's up?

200
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,810
Nothing, master.

201
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,140
Hey! Hurry up.

202
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,820
Coming!

203
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,010
Xia Jie, take this car.

204
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,060
Girl.

205
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,940
Ms. Xu.

206
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,020
Can we exchange the car we take?

207
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,740
I want to take this.

208
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,540
What's the difference?

209
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,200
Thank you.

210
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,680
Just because the person in the car is the main culprit?

211
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,380
You said a person in the car is the main culprit?

212
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,140
Who?

213
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,620
It's her.

214
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,060
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

215
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,780
I won't change it.

216
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,780
What happened?

217
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,950
Nothing. Thank you.

218
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,180
Hurry up.

219
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:58,970
Let's go.

220
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,220
Ms. Xu, I'm here.

221
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,890
Get in.

222
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,120
Officer,

223
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,080
my child is so young.

224
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,980
Officer Xia, if I'm in prison,

225
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,740
what about her?

226
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,420
You called me

227
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,420
to pick up my kid,

228
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,410
so I knew my wife and I

229
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,300
met a kind person like you.

230
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,140
I'm farming in the village all the year round

231
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,020
and I can't make much money.

232
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,260
The whole family is waiting to eat.

233
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,860
Xia Jie

234
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,020
Xia Jie.

235
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,540
What happened to her?

236
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,350
Mom, I'm back.

237
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
You're back.

238
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,690
Didn't you say

239
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,140
you wouldn't come back today?

240
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,740
The case is settled,

241
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,500
so I don't have to work overtime and go back.

242
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,820
Mom,

243
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,090
look what I bought for you.

244
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,960
I bought your favorite Shaomai

245
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,900
and char siew pastry.

246
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,450
Jie,

247
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,350
did anything happen to you?

248
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,380
What could happen to me?

249
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,360
I'm just worried about you.

250
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,340
I'm afraid you won't eat.

251
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,700
Right?

252
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,050
Did Wang Shouyi and the others make you angry?

253
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,610
Mom.

254
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,230
What are you thinking about?

255
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,740
Everyone in the office is so nice to me.

256
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,730
Their kindness almost overwhelms me.

257
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,380
Really?

258
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,930
Of course.

259
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,750
Mom, I just want to be an ordinary police officer.

260
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,220
Everyone is so nice to me,

261
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,400
which makes me feel stressful.

262
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,930
How about I talk to them?

263
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,020
No, no!

264
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,200
Their attention to me is excessive now.

265
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,540
Mom, have one first.

266
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,210
I'll heat up the dishes.

267
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,460
Jie,

268
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,220
your aunt called this afternoon.

269
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,660
She asked me why I didn't mention this year's recuperation,

270
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,360
and asked me if I would go.

271
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,770
Then I called the bureau

272
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,250
but no one answered.

273
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,460
Mom.

274
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,220
I told you not to trouble the bureau.

275
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,090
The procedure of welfare is strict now.

276
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,280
You make things difficult for them.

277
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,820
How could it be?

278
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,570
Your dad is a martyr.

279
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,170
Yes, he is.

280
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,190
But we can't depend on him forever.

281
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,150
Besides, I'm working now.

282
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,970
My salary is enough for your recuperation.

283
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,780
I'll arrange it for you tomorrow.

284
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,730
Don't worry about the living.

285
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,570
I'll stay with your aunt later.

286
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,340
Don't do that. My aunt has a family too.

287
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,900
It's not like you'll only be here for a few days.

288
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,750
I wish your dad were here.

289
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,530
Can we talk about something happy?

290
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,610
Zhao.

291
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,330
Good morning, instructor.

292
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,860
Morning. You're cleaning.

293
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,330
Instructor, did you just come back from the hospital?

294
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,900
Yes.

295
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,900
Instructor,

296
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,560
I have nothing to do tonight.

297
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,880
How about I go to the hospital to take care of the elderly for you?

298
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,770
Before my grandpa passed away,

299
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,690
I stayed by his side for two years.

300
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,440
I don't need anyone to take care of my elderly member.

301
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,790
Work hard.

302
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,860
Good morning, instructor.

303
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,620
Morning.

304
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,770
Morning, Chief.

305
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,280
How are the elder in your family?

306
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,580
Still the same.

307
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,340
I guess it won't be peaceful

308
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,690
in this autumn and winter.

309
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,900
How about

310
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,980
we arrange a shift for you?

311
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,860
No need. I can still hold on.

312
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,890
Chief Gao, Chief Cheng is helping me.

313
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,580
OK. Tell me if you need anything.

314
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Chief. Chief!

315
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,780
There's no water in your water dispenser.

316
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,740
Let me change another for you.

317
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,580
Go.

318
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,380
Watch your waist. Don't hurt yourself.

319
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,460
This kid

320
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,750
is so sensible and quick-witted.

321
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,350
It's too early to make that conclusion.

322
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,180
His performance is so obvious.

323
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,850
Go talk to him.

324
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,760
You are good at ideological work.

325
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,050
Sun,

326
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,620
give this material

327
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,100
to Chief for a sign,

328
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,410
and go to the legal brigade.

329
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,330
We caught the people red handed.

330
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,900
There's no reason not to authorize detention.

331
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,090
It's enough to arrest

332
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,100
that strong man.

333
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,460
Okay.

334
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,100
Okay, go ahead.

335
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,610
Alright.

336
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,090
Master, I make tea for you.

337
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,070
Master, drink some.

338
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,020
Master.

339
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,520
I was wrong this time.

340
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,570
I didn't follow your orders.

341
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,650
I apologize.

342
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,480
But master,

343
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,130
I need to explain the situation to you.

344
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,550
Sun told me

345
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,420
you'd been watching them for a long time.

346
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,690
They were dragging the suitcases at that time

347
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,900
and were about to go on a long trip.

348
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,050
If we didn't catch them this time,

349
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,790
your previous efforts would be in vain.

350
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,060
Are you apologizing?

351
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,100
Do you still think

352
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,470
I should thank you?

353
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,570
Without you,

354
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,900
I can't complete my task this month.

355
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,930
- Is that so?
- Master, I didn't mean that.

356
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,830
I'm explaining the situation to you.

357
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,840
No more explanation.

358
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,060
By the way, Li Dawei,

359
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,950
from now on,

360
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,820
you decide what you do, okay?

361
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,730
If one day you can remember

362
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,500
there's an old man named Chen Xincheng,

363
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,890
just tell me.

364
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,590
If you can't remember,

365
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,620
Just treat my words as bullshit

366
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,330
and ignore them.

367
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,830
Stop talking.

368
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,580
Excuse me.

369
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,770
Xia Jie,

370
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,780
Come here.

371
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,220
Does she look familiar?

372
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,140
Miss Li?

373
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,100
She came early in the morning to express her gratitude.

374
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,100
You could get your bag and phone back so quickly

375
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,650
mainly with the help of Officer Xia.

376
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,770
Officer Xia.

377
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,540
Thank you. Thank you so much.

378
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,200
You're welcome.

379
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,310
This is what we should do.

380
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,900
But let me remind you.

381
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,500
Be alert when you go out in the future.

382
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,860
Don't carry this bag behind you.

383
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,360
Even if it won't be not snatched by others,

384
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,810
it's easy to be scratched, right?

385
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,460
Okay, please go back.

386
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,500
Take your stuff.

387
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,130
Okay.

388
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,740
Don't bother to see me out.

389
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,710
Let's go.

390
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,670
Master.

391
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,860
What happened?

392
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,700
What do you mean?

393
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,820
The matter of finding her bag and phone.

394
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,380
But didn't we...

395
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,970
We gave up at that time

396
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,180
because of various factors.

397
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,430
Jie,

398
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,740
It's the police officer's responsibility to

399
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,730
to be undaunted when facing criminals.

400
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,210
But

401
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,980
when I heard that there was only a phone in her bag,

402
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,260
I knew what would happen next.

403
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,390
It's a way to

404
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,330
catch a robber head-on.

405
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,350
But it's also a method

406
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,550
to be indirect.

407
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,410
Master, what did you do?

408
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,220
Think about it.

409
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,330
The robber didn't get any money.

410
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,670
There's only a phone.

411
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,560
He would definitely cash it out.

412
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,550
The big store won't accept such kind of goods,

413
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,870
so I talked to the bosses

414
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,970
of some small shops.

415
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
Then we caught him red-handed.

416
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,820
I'm sorry, master.

417
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,930
I misunderstood you.

418
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,080
I always think too highly of myself.

419
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,570
Don't say that.

420
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,340
There's plenty of time yet.

421
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,170
Let's talk later.

422
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,170
Master,

423
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,480
I have something more important

424
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,370
that I should admit my mistake.

425
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,370
Mistake?

426
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,220
Chief Cheng.

427
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,080
Someone from Guiyuan Community reported to the police.

428
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,750
She said she didn't sleep all night because of some disturbance.

429
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,180
Please take a look.

430
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,670
Okay.

431
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,490
Hello.

432
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,460
Captain Wu.

433
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,870
I remember.

434
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,930
Okay.

435
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,690
I'll be right there.

436
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,820
Okay, see you.

437
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,950
Jie, I need to go to the district bureau.

438
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,100
I'll handle it.

439
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,320
This?

440
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,300
No, you can't.

441
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,010
Master.

442
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,220
Okay, I'll send someone to accompany you.

443
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,180
Ding.

444
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,620
Is there any other police officers in the station?

445
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,850
No.

446
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,600
Otherwise, I can't send this task to you.

447
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,890
But she said it's some disturbance. Maybe...

448
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,310
Okay, I got it.

449
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,280
What's that smell?

450
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:56,890
Organic fertilizer.

451
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,670
Hello.

452
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,610
Did you call the police?

453
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,700
Hello.

454
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,560
Hello, did you call the police?

455
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,520
Officers, I did.

456
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,550
Here's the thing.

457
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,030
The one upstairs

458
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,860
is so unreasonable.

459
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:12,770
I don't think

460
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,140
it's a healthy sex life.

461
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,650
They cries and wails every day.

462
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,300
Our walls are swaying with them.

463
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,490
It's okay, sir

464
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,940
We're just to get the situation.

465
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,570
Madam.

466
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,110
I have a kid who arrives at school age.

467
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,070
How annoying!

468
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,490
What do you mean, madam?

469
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,060
Can you go upstairs and tell them

470
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,250
to keep quiet in the future?

471
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,600
What's wrong with your police station?

472
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,970
I've told the general situation

473
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,630
when calling the police.

474
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,380
Why did they send you three

475
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,050
young guys to come here?

476
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,050
Wait, madam.

477
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,870
How can we say this?

478
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,770
It's not convenient for us to tell them.

479
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,820
I can ask the police if I need help, right?

480
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,160
Madam, this kind of thing

481
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,260
is private.

482
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,420
The police can't handle it.

483
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,260
What do you mean, young man?

484
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,120
If you say so,

485
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,630
no one can handle it.

486
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,330
Then whom should I find?

487
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,430
I mean that

488
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,700
you can go up

489
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,600
and remind them.

490
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,870
That will be OK.

491
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,220
That's bullshit.

492
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,180
Let me knock on their door

493
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,980
and tell them

494
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,600
to keep your voice down in your sex life?.

495
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,340
They will kick me out.

496
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,520
If we go up,

497
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,150
they will also kick us out.

498
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,100
This is what you police should do.

499
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,000
Okay, let's go up.

500
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,390
If the people are in trouble,

501
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,500
we police have to deal with it.

502
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,770
Which one?

503
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,640
The fourth floor upstairs.

504
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,500
One, two, three, four.

505
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,690
We live on the third floor.

506
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,390
Okay, please go upstairs with us.

507
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,410
No.

508
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,140
What do you want us to say?

509
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,030
This is between a couple.

510
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,490
We didn't see or hear anything.

511
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,230
We need a witness, right?

512
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,450
I can't go with you.

513
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,450
If I go up,

514
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,170
they will scold me after you leave.

515
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,690
Then we have no choice.

516
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,930
You won't testify,

517
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,900
And we go up and blame them for no reason.

518
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,420
What if they don't admit it?

519
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,500
Madam, you...

520
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,900
Forget it.

521
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,700
Please sign here.

522
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,440
Thank you. Have a good life.

523
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,100
037's reporting.

524
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,380
The dispute is over.

525
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,960
The caller agrees not to pursue the matter.

526
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,820
Over.

527
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,590
Li Dawei,

528
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,100
you are born to be a policeman.

529
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,420
Just now,

530
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,050
it would be awkward for us to knock on the door.

531
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,150
The doctor is flattering me.

532
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,610
What's the good of it?

533
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,510
You can live with me.

534
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,000
Xia Jie can join too.

535
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
It takes 5,000 a month,

536
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,550
with the master bedroom of 1,800

537
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,020
and two second bedrooms 1,600 each.

538
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,120
You can choose first.

539
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,300
Xia Jie,

540
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,770
did something happen to you?

541
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,280
What could happen to her, the God's favored one?

542
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,350
No one is the God's favored one.

543
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,810
I thought I should be a policewoman,

544
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
a good one.

545
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,960
Isn't it?

546
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,740
They say this family's disgrace can't be exposed.

547
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,110
I've already lost my face

548
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,790
a long time ago.

549
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,840
I have two sons and a daughter.

550
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,460
They never come back.

551
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,270
When I suffered from some illness,

552
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,520
I could only rely on the two of us.

553
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,520
The middle one even left my grandson to us.

554
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,380
I didn't expect that they would come back

555
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,730
when they heard about the demolition.

556
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,370
Dad.

557
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,110
All of they showed filial piety

558
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,790
to take care of us.

559
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,360
I knew

560
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,230
they came for the demolition fund.

561
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,280
Dad,

562
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,130
please.

563
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,400
Come back with me.

564
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,540
Why?

565
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,110
Have you ever cared about our father?

566
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,980
Have you?

567
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,990
Of course I did.

568
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,780
I put Bao here

569
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,180
to entertain my parents.

570
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,860
I didn't agree to put him here.

571
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,900
Chunmei argued with me a lot because of this.

572
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,000
Is it easy for me?

573
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,130
Your glib talk sounds as sweet as a song.

574
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,500
You left Bao here without a penny.

575
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,010
How dare you say that?

576
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,310
What are you yelling about?

577
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
You're married.

578
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,940
This family has nothing to do with you.

579
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,720
So what?

580
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,480
Mom.

581
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,190
Mom, come with me. I'll take care of you.

582
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,660
Dad, I'll take care of you.

583
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,880
Dad, I'll take care of you.

584
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,630
What are you doing?

585
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,330
Our parents have to come with me.

586
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,500
Come with me!

587
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,060
Stop!

588
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,100
Your parents don't want to go back with you.

589
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,750
I'm warning you.

590
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,300
It's illegal if you do it again.

591
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,380
You police are too nosy.

592
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,160
It's illegal for us to be filial to our parents?

593
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,250
That's right.

594
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,440
Are you being filial?

595
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,590
You're robbing them!

596
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,060
Grandma, I'm hungry.

597
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,390
I'll take you to eat.

598
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,640
Mom, where are you going?

599
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,300
It's not over yet.

600
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,100
That's right.

601
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,270
That's ridiculous.

602
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,690
Would you stop that?

603
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,550
Aren't you afraid others will laugh at you?

604
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,150
Take the kid out for some food.

605
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,190
Yes, master.

606
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,200
Come, Bao.

607
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,810
Come with me.

608
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,030
Officer, where are you taking him?

609
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,290
We're not done yet. How can you leave?

610
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,220
We're not done yet.

611
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,910
Where are you going?

612
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,140
Do you have any shred of humanity?

613
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,670
The kid is hungry, you know?

614
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,040
Go.

615
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,230
Bring Bao to eat something.

616
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,220
Your mother and I are still here.

617
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,820
Bao, are you hungry?

618
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,490
The noodles will be ready soon.

619
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,340
The noodles are here.

620
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,520
Okay, thank you.

621
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,550
Thank you.

622
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,500
Eat slowly.

623
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,130
Bao, slow down.

624
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,180
Boss, we have another dish.

625
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,250
Boss.

626
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,010
Boss?

627
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,660
Bao, you eat first.

628
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,920
What ... what are you doing?

629
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,310
I ... I'm taking a rest here.

630
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,680
What are you doing here?

631
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,770
Work.

632
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,280
I ... ID card.

633
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,680
Did you do anything bad?

634
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,960
No.

635
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,390
Drive at the intersection ahead. Don't park here.

636
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,410
Where are you going?

637
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,890
Li Dawei, where are you going?

638
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,090
Li Dawei,

639
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,760
# - Bao, are you finished?
- Sir, I'm done.

640
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,420
Great.

641
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,290
Let's go.

642
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,530
Go.

643
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,170
Let's go.

644
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,300
Master.

645
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,450
Are you full now?

646
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,050
Master.

647
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,290
Master.

648
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,630
Is it delicious?

649
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,190
Yes.

650
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,310
I just found a key person.

651
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,150
who just got out of prison.

652
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,210
Really?

653
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,489
Okay, don't argue with them anymore.

654
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,250
It's okay. I'll come back in a few days.

655
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,080
Okay.

656
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,730
You are so obedient. Listen to your grandma.

657
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,920
Say goodbye to them.

658
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,870
Bye.

659
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:26,690
Thank you. See you.

660
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,710
# - OK. Take care.
- Bye.

661
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,920
All right, let's go back to the station.

662
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,810
Master, how about...

663
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,170
Stop!

664
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,840
Dawei.

665
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,450
Are you really a policeman?

666
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,520
It's really you.

667
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,270
Why are you back?

668
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,080
This is my home.

669
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,440
How can I not come back?

670
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,230
Where did you come back from?

671
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,840
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines.

672
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,580
I came all of them.

673
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,450
I guess that

674
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,700
you must have made a lot of money, right?

675
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,100
I have something else to do.

676
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,400
What is it?

677
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,530
Cut the crap and come with me.

678
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,410
Where are we going?

679
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,770
I'll go with you.

680
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,050
Come with me. Cut the crap.

681
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,690
I'll help him.

682
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,790
Don't go there. Someone is recording.

683
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,120
I didn't do anything wrong.

684
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,290
Let's go.

685
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,250
Why should I go with you?

686
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,330
I'm not going with you.

687
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,220
Are you done?

688
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,240
Xia Jie, what's up?

689
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,160
Li Dawei, you're in police uniform.

690
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,890
Someone is recording.

691
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,720
Let go of me!

692
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,850
Stop recording! What does it have to do with you?

693
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:19,810
Stop!

694
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,370
Stop running!

695
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,520
Stop!

696
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,250
What happened?

697
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,440
Nothing.

698
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,360
Chief Cheng, I was looking for you.

699
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,040
No problem.

700
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,520
My wife is picking my kid up today.

701
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,280
I'll can definitely be on duty.

702
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,410
How can I always ask you to do mine?

703
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,290
Go back now.

704
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,880
My husband is on leave today.

705
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,900
Give me the shift record.

706
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,700
OK. Just tell me if you need anything.

707
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,110
I'll go to Xia Jie's house with Chief.

708
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,170
Another call.

709
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,690
Well,

710
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,140
instructor.

711
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,850
Look at him. I don’t think he has a place to live.

712
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,450
Really?

713
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,280
It's been days.

714
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,380
He's been sleeping in the office.

715
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,880
That day, he asked me

716
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,570
whether there's a dormitory for us.

717
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,330
I said no.

718
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,440
I advised him to rent with someone else.

719
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,680
He then said he had a place to live.

720
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,250
Isn't it weird?

721
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,440
I'm leaving.

722
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,290
I'll call them back.

723
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,920
Xincheng, time to go home.

724
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,330
Instructor,

725
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,560
He hasn't slept well

726
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,640
for several nights.

727
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,380
He's exhausted.

728
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
Bye, Cheng.

729
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,250
Wake him up and let him sleep in the bed.

730
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,640
There are only a few beds.

731
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,090
Since the old police on duty didn't sleep.

732
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,170
does he dare to sleep?

733
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,960
Zhao.

734
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,450
Zhao.

735
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,800
Why are you still here?

736
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,490
Instructor,

737
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,340
I’m new here. I want to learn more.

738
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,730
There's a bed in my office.

739
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,410
Come back to study after you sleep.

740
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,440
No, I'm not sleepy.

741
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,280
Go to sleep.

742
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,400
I'll call you when I need help.

743
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,170
Go.

744
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,090
No need, instructor.

745
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,560
I'm really not sleepy.

746
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,890
Besides, it's not time to sleep.

747
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,310
How about I go out for some exercise?

748
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,050
I'm leaving, Qiancheng.

749
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,520
I'm a little confused.

750
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,530
Go take a look.

751
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,670
Instructor, let me watch him.

752
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,970
This young man is interesting.

753
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,820
Aren't you getting off?

754
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,650
Call Li Dawei again.

755
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,120
Hello, Li Dawei, where are you?

756
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,920
Are you okay?

757
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,440
Really?

758
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,560
OK.

759
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,480
What did he say?

760
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,700
He said he's fine. We can rest assured.

761
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,170
We'll talk later.

762
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,760
Let's go.

763
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,330
Okay, I'm telling you.

764
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,520
Don't ever leave here.

765
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,810
Or you'll suffer the consequences.

766
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,210
This gift is a bit light.

767
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,090
No, it's heavy.

768
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,210
No.

769
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,650
I just want to see my sister-in-law.

770
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,160
You're a little nervous.

771
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,680
I dare not go.

772
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,170
Well, my master's wife...

773
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,410
You are Xia Jie's master now.

774
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,410
She won't make you embarrassed

775
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,690
in front of Jie.

776
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,650
You have to face it.

777
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,070
Chief, this is why

778
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,780
you let me be Xia Jie's master.

779
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,040
I didn't force you.

780
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,290
You chose it yourself.

781
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,330
Jie is here.

782
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm coming.

783
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,210
Jie.

784
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,150
Jie, your master told me

785
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,530
he chose an office for you.

786
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,770
But you didn't sit here.

787
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,400
You wanted to

788
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,370
stay with those stinky men?

789
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,320
You are good.

790
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,010
Like father, like daughter.

791
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,960
You're much better than

792
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,330
when we first joined the police force.

793
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,080
Yes.

794
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,090
My mom called again?

795
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,810
- No.
- No.

796
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,610
No.

797
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,450
Chief, master,

798
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,640
is there a mission?

799
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,630
No, no.

800
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,330
Well, you're off work.

801
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,680
Let Chief Cheng drive,

802
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,890
and we'll take you home.

803
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,040
No need. I can go back by myself.

804
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,630
Well,

805
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,460
we can visit our sister-in-law by the way.

806
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,010
Right, on your first day here,

807
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,370
we should have visited her.

808
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,120
Since there were many matters these days,

809
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,040
we were not free.

810
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,250
We have time now.

811
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,490
We'll go and have a look.

812
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,410
Sorry, Chief, master.

813
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,120
I have a reunion tonight with my classmates

814
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,630
to congratulate me on joining the police force.

815
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,660
Young people like to have fun together.

816
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,560
Let her go.

817
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,920
Look at this mess.

818
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,370
We should inform her in advance

819
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,040
and discuss it.

820
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,770
Yes.

821
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,360
Here, take the stuff.

822
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,440
Thank you, Chief.

823
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,030
Thank you, master.

824
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,290
You're welcome.

825
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,680
Look at you.

826
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,210
You've grown so tall.

827
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,570
You hurt us.

828
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,110
If Chief Xia was alive, then...

829
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:14,810
Hello?

830
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:16,600
What?

831
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,770
Okay.

832
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,200
I see.

833
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,520
Where is Li Dawei?

834
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:27,930
Is he off work?

835
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,790
Well, well, well...

836
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:31,960
Where's Xincheng?

837
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,840
He should still be here.

838
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,640
What happened?

839
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,040
Let's go.

840
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,770
Xincheng, where is Li Dawei?

841
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,570
Chief.

842
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,650
He might have gone back.

843
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,000
Call him

844
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,330
and ask him to come back to the station.

845
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,250
If he doesn't want to be a police officer anymore,

846
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,370
get out as soon as possible.

847
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,230
OK.

848
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,920
If you say so,

849
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,400
I won't say anything today.

850
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,170
You bastard!

851
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,050
Yes, I'm a jerk.

852
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,090
My dad is a jerk too.

853
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:31,640
OK.

854
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,920
OK. Li Dawei.

855
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,000
I can't take care of you anymore.

856
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,440
You can find whoever you want.

857
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,370
Li Dawei,

858
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,330
get up here!

859
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,050
Do you know where it is?

860
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,040
This is the public security bureau.

861
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,210
This is the police station.

862
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,600
There's nothing we can't find out.

863
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:48,830
I didn't take the chance.

864
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,100
Besides, I didn't break the law.

865
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,600
You didn't. But you broke the regulation.

866
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,870
Do you still want to wear this uniform?
