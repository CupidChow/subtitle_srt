5
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,180
Are you sure this is the right place?

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,280
Since Bao Daquan disappeared from the security footage,

7
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,570
this was the only path Bao Daquan could go down.

8
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,980
Who do you think that girl was?

9
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,790
Why was she in his passenger seat?

10
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,810
When he borrowed the car, he said he was going home.

11
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,820
I guess

12
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,520
that girl may be from his hometown.

13
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,340
And she wanted a lift.

14
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,700
But on the way,

15
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,240
Bao Daquan wanted her money.

16
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,100
But I saw them talking and laughing.

17
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,220
They didn't look like strangers.

18
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,260
No matter who she was,

19
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,220
she was there when they went up the mountain.

20
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,730
And she disappeared on the way down.

21
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,120
So,

22
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
she's probably on the mountain.

23
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,630
But the mountain is so big.

24
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,410
Look, there's another fork.

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,570
If you want to rob money or rape her,

26
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,900
or do something bad,

27
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,700
where would you choose?

28
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,050
Stop.

29
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,860
What's wrong?

30
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,260
This road is so narrow.

31
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,020
Normal people must have thought something was wrong

32
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,700
and rebelled.

33
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,460
They couldn't be far.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,329
If something happened to her,

35
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,540
it must be somewhere around here.

36
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,380
Let's go back.

37
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,840
Are you afraid?

38
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm okay.

39
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,710
What's wrong?

40
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,760
Good for you.

41
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,090
Come here.

42
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,660
Sit here and have a rest. Come here.

43
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,140
Stay here for a minute.

44
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,020
I'll get you some water.

45
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,620
Here.

46
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,660
Is that him?

47
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,700
Don't move! Police!

48
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,740
Qiao!

49
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,020
Police! Don't move!

50
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,480
Qiao! We're done!

51
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,510
Behave yourself!

52
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,230
Here. This way.

53
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,730
The elevator. The elevator.

54
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,570
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

55
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,460
Thank you.

56
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,810
This was the last madness of a gambler.

57
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,540
He owed over a million and he ran out of road.

58
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,280
So he wanted to go home to see his mother

59
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,300
and then die.

60
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,540
On his way back to his hometown,

61
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,610
he met the girl who wanted a lift.

62
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,020
During their conversation,

63
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,500
he learned that this girl

64
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,980
could earn over 200,000 a year selling cosmetics.

65
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,540
So he was up to something bad.

66
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,340
He took the opportunity

67
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,980
to abduct her to Lotus Mountain.

68
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,220
He hit the girl halfway

69
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
with a wrench.

70
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,820
He went into a frenzy after that.

71
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,180
If we

72
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,020
hadn't caught him

73
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,700
outside his ex-girlfriend's house,

74
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,430
it would have been very dangerous.

75
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,940
You're all very good.

76
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,020
Before his first criminal act

77
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,140
was exposed,

78
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,540
you accurately predicted

79
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,690
his next actions

80
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,100
and avoided more losses

81
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
of people's lives and property.

82
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,740
Very good.

83
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,060
Who was the first to discover it?

84
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,090
Cao Jianjun.

85
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,180
Jianjun?

86
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,980
I heard he was the one who made the arrest.

87
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,420
Yes.

88
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,290
He's a good cop.

89
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,730
I seem to remember seeing his name

90
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,710
on the list of nominees for merit several times.

91
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,700
But he's not officially credited, right?

92
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,500
We need to honor him this time.

93
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,630
Here we are.

94
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,300
Director,

95
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,660
this is the person involved in the case.

96
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,820
Miss Yang,

97
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,020
our director is here to see you.

98
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,710
Don't move, Miss Yang.

99
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,340
How are you feeling? Any better?

100
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,460
I'm feeling better.

101
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,230
So many people.

102
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,540
Yes, yes, yes. Come on, come on, come on.

103
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,940
-You should interview more of our ordinary police.
 -Go and find Jianjun.

104
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,940
He's over here.

105
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,660
Jianjun!

106
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,390
Come here!

107
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,150
-Hello. -Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

108
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,540
The people's police protect the people.

109
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,940
Give it up for our hero.

110
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,660
Okay, okay.

111
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,060
Give it up for our hero.

112
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,380
Here we go. Let's take a picture.

113

Here we go. Let's take a picture.

114

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,890
Good.

116
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,610
-Good. -Come on, come on, come on.

117

Chief Wang,

118
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,860
congratulations,

119
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,700
congratulations.

120
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,370
Your police station

121
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,650
did all the work

122
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,340
for our vice squad.

123
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,380
The dangerous work

124
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,330
is still up to the brothers in the vice squad.

125
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,580
I pulled

126
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,540
your testimony.

127
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,380
It's not easy. It's not easy.

128
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,210
You are better

129
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,620
than I am.

130
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,380
That's the way it is.

131
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,500
Chief Wang,

132
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,980
it's time for you to be in the spotlight.

133
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Enjoy it, enjoy it.

134
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,140
What are you talking about?

135
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,780
You should go.

136
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm leaving.

137
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,940
Go, go, go.

138
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,780
In all your years as a policeman,

139
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,100
is there anything you'd like to say to us?

140
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,260
Well...

141
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,980
It's our duty

142
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,260
to serve the people heart and soul!

143
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,700
Good!

144
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,260
Please get out of the way.

145
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,450
Jianjun, step forward.

146
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,940
-Stand forward. -Here, here, here.

147
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,810
Here, here, here.

148
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,290
The tall men stand in the back!

149
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,420
Everybody, listen to me!

150
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,580
Now listen to me!

151
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,260
I say one, two, three.

152
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,300
Let's say cheese.

153
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,740
Okay.

154
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,850
Put on your hats. Put on your hats.

155
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,220
Yes. Put on your hats.

156
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,520
Are you okay?

157
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,740
Come on. One! Two! Three!

158
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,220
Cheese!

159
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,980
Let's say serve the people, okay?

160
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,700
Okay, okay okay.

161
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,780
One! Two! Three!

162
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,010
Serve the people!

163
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,100
All right. We got it.

164
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,420
Jianjun, you do the interview.

165
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,140
We're going back.

166
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,420
Okay, Chief Gao.

167
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,380
Thank you. Thank you.

168
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,540
Qizi, I'll leave this to you.

169
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,340
Okay.

170
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,420
Yes. The mission we're on is really...

172
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,380
Thank our neighbors.

173
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,460
Thank you for your support.

174
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,340
Yang Shu!

175
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,040
Let me introduce...

176
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,020
You called me?

177
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,860
Call Li Dawei and Xia Jie

178
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,170
up for me.

179
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,490
Why?

180
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,810
I need to talk to him.

181
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,940
And, as I mentioned,

182
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,340
the great honor of being a policeman...

183
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,410
I'm officer Cao's apprentice.

184
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,740
I'm proud

185
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,220
to be able to learn from

186
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,300
such an excellent police officer.

187
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,010
-Report. 
-Report.

188
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,580
You must be very happy and excited

189
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,340
to find the first victim

190
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,260
and save her life.

191
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,660
Chief, we didn't.

192
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,570
Cao is really amazing.

193
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,570
We just did what a cop should do.

194
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,050
But I didn't give you a pennant.

195
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,660
How about

196
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,780
I sewing one for you?

197
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,820
No, no, no.

198
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,860
We're not even close to him.

199
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,590
What's the first article of the Police Code?

200
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,320
Follow directions in all your actions!

201
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,780
How many times have I told you?

202
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,660
Have you all forgotten?

203
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,090
Chief,

204
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,460
weren't you the one

205
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,540
who asked us to join the search?

206
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,460
I also told you,

207
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,860
all operations were directed by Gao Chao.

208
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,060
Didn't you hear me?

209
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,300
Don't play dumb with me!

210
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,180
You're acting on your own! Do you know?

211
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,240
Do you have any organization in mind?

212
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,440
Do you have any discipline?

213
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,740
Chief, we saw

214
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,740
a lot of blood on that car.

215
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,780
The victim's life

216
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,980
could be in danger.

217
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,020
The sooner we got there,

218
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,450
the better chance she would survive.

219
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,940
That's why I went there early.

220
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,060
Li Dawei,

221
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,060
put your hand on your chest

222
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,020
and answer me seriously.

223
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,020
You were in such a hurry to get there.

224
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,620
Did you ever want to

225
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,820
steal the thunder?

226
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,620
Did you?

227
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,210
Chief,

228
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,130
I did.

229
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,970
You're quite aboveboard.

230
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,180
You didn't ask me

231
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
if I wanted to save her.

232
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,620
Well, let me ask you,

233
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,420
did you want to save her?

234
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,460
Chief,

235
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,460
I did.

236
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,290
You two...

237
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,130
If you two weren't cops,

238
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,940
I would give you an award

239
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,380
for bravery.

240
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,820
But you two are police.

241
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,850
You're wearing uniforms.

242
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,730
Obeying orders is the first thing.

243
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,700
What did you do?

244
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,780
Although

245
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
the result was good,

246
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,230
it didn't change the nature of you acting on your own

247
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,250
and violation of discipline.

248
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,970
Chief, I accept your criticism.

249
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,850
Chief, I accept your criticism, too.

250
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
You're right to accept criticism.

251
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,860
I need you

252
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,670
to write me

253
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,020
an in-depth review.

254
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,340
Yes, sir.

255
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,940
Yes.

256
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,820
Chief,

257
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,090
how many words do we have to write?

258
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,900
20,000.

259
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,020
20,000?

260
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,220
Yes, 20,000.

261
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,860
This... This is because you...

262
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,500
Because you two have a great attitude

263
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,560
about admitting your mistakes.

264
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,680
And you, Li Dawei, are aboveboard.

265
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,460
I'll cut you 2,000,

266
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,500
18,000 words.

267
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,380
But it was only 8,000 last time,

268
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,700
-why... 
-Are you bargaining with me?

269
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,460
No, no, no.

270
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,720
18,000. 18,000.

271
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,910
We'll do it right away.

272
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,580
Xia Jie.

273
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,340
Chief,

274
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,820
If he writes 18,000 words, I'll write 18,000 words, too.

275
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,780
I don't need special treatment.

276
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,620
I didn't mean that.

277
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,420
I just wanted to know

278
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,380
if you were scared.

279
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,170
No.

280
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,380
Good.

281
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,460
But don't tell your mother

282
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,980
about this.

283
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,820
Yes.

284
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,180
Okay, you go back.

285
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,690
See you, Chief.

286
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,500
Hello, Instructor.

287
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,260
Instructor.

288
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
What are you doing at my door?

289
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,760
Just got angry?

290
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,210
But I feel that

291
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,820
your anger

292
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,290
wasn't all about them, was it?

293
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Then who was I mad at?

294
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,780
Cao Jianjun?

295
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,980
The director praised him,

296
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,180
what can I say?

297
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,260
Besides, he caught the murderer himself.

298
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,610
But young people can't be like this.

299
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,060
Li Dawei and Xia Jie are new cops

300
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,619
and they have this bad idea

301
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,579
of stealing the thunder.

302
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,540
If we don't nip this kind of bad idea

303
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,579
in the bud,

304
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,339
it will cause more trouble in the future.

305
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,780
You're right.

306
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,220
Cao Jianjun did a great job this time.

307
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,260
Let's give him some credit.

308
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,220
You think I don't know that?

309
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,810
You think giving him credit

310
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,880
is gonna be a good thing?

311
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,460
Who knows

312
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,300
if we actually gave him the credit,

313
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,100
what would happen?

314
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,020
Maybe if he got the credit,

315
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,540
he could prove himself

316
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,590
to his wife and mother-in-law.

317
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,540
Then their issue will be solved.

318
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,620
What if

319
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,100
it's gonna be all right?

320
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,380
It's not that simple.

321
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,410
Is he the kind of guy who needs to prove himself

322
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,840
to others?

323
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,490
He is a showman himself.

324
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,530
But anyway,

325
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,740
he has done a great job this time.

326
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,360
It doesn't make any sense

327
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,810
if we don't give him the credit.

328
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
If I don't give him this credit,

329
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,060
there's an explanation.

330
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,380
I told them,

331
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,140
they needed to follow the Bureau's instructions

332
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,080
and act in unison.

333
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,300
He took the liberty of going to the victim's house.

334
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,700
He did this because he was afraid someone else would take the credit.

335
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,380
His motive was not right .

336
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,640
That's why

337
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,500
I can't give him the credit.

338
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,140
Chief, if you...

339
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,170
Then I think you're being a little unfair

340
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,890
to him.

341
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,060
Who used to be the pacesetter in our station?

342
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,340
Chen Xincheng, right?

343
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,300
But he has been a little depressed these last few years.

344
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,220
Cao Jianjun is the best

345
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,240
at his age.

346
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,470
You have to admit that.

347
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,890
Actually, everyone at the station knows

348
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,580
Cao Jianjun is your favorite.

349
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,910
But the ones you like the most

350
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,780
are the ones with the worst luck.

351
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,100
Otherwise, in his situation,

352
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,250
in other police stations,

353
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,770
he could have got several second-class honors.

354
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,780
But now he only

355
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,020
got a third-class merit.

356
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,420
Do you think...

357
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,020
So we should criticize them if they do something wrong.

358
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,880
We should praise them if...

359
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,580
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

360
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,940
Well, draw up a report

361
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,300
on his exploits.

362
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,900
We should give him credit

363
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,140
as well as criticize him.

364
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,740
Don't be angry. Have some water.

365
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,090
My goodness.

366
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,740
New?

367
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,420
Yes.

368
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,330
Morning, Jianjun.

369
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:02,900
Zhigang.

370
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,260
You look refreshed.

371
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,090
Cao.

372
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,900
Morning.

373
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,560
Ding.

374
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,580
Jianjun.

375
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,340
Report!

376
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,060
Jianjun.

377
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,620
Come on in! Come on in! Come on in!

378
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,420
Here. Here, here, here.

379
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,580
Come on. Sit down, please.

380
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,140
Sit down. Sit down.

381
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,820
Well... black tea?

382
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,700
Let me do it.

383
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,780
No, no, no. Be seated.

384
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,340
Be seated.

385
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,770
My black tea is good.

386
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,140
Here, here, here.

387
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,860
Jianjun,

388
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,900
you have done a great job.

389
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,660
Are you waiting for me to praise you?

390
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,660
Are you?

391
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,500
No, Chief.

392
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,450
I didn't do enough.

393
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,870
Jianjun,

394
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,940
I made it clear that

395
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,260
you must patrol this key area

396
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,420
to prevent an emergency from happening.

397
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,590
Why did you go to

398
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,690
the female victim's house?

399
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,380
This clue just popped into my head.

400
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,260
Really?

401
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,370
And I was the only one who knew her address.

402
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,820
If I reported and arranged on the spot,

403
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,980
it would have been too late.

404
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,940
You're afraid you're gonna lose the credit, weren't you?

405
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,290
You're afraid someone might take credit for your work.

406
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,510
Chief, I caught the gangster.

407
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,260
Isn't this the credit of our station?

408
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,890
Jianjun,

409
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,780
I kept saying it.

410
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,600
I said Cao Jianjun was a good policeman,

411
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,590
who has always been.

412
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,140
Whether people admit it or not,

413
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,200
you're a good policeman.

414
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,980
Some people like to look down upon others.

415
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,570
If you take the initiative to quarrel with them,

416
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,580
you dishonor yourself.

417
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,860
Chief, I know.

418
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,860
I've never looked down on myself,

419
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,860
ever.

420
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,820
And not only did I not look down on myself,

421
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,640
I also knew that

422
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,500
I had to keep improving myself

423
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,660
and proving myself.

424
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,940
You really don't understand

425
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,300
what I'm trying to say, do you?

426
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,150
Chief, I see your point.

427
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,180
You're being so hard on me

428
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,820
because it's for my own good.

429
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,860
That's for...

430
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,420
You want me to do better in the future.

431
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,960
All right, all right, all right.

432
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,420
Let's leave it at that.

433
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,360
You go ahead.

434
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,690
I'm leaving, Chief.

435
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,690
By the way,

436
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,500
we stated your exploits.

437
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,420
Thank you, Chief!

438
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,770
Why are you so surprised?

439
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,450
Just go, go, go. Go.

440
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,140
Thank you.

441
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,530
Chief, want some?

442
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,000
It looks good. Good.

443
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,130
Chief!

444
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,980
Chief, good news!

445
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,300
What is it?

446
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,860
Instructor, what is it?

447
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,620
Tell us, Instructor.

448
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,420
The Bureau just got word that

449
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,260
Jianjun's second-class merit was approved.

450
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
And...

451
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,940
The director said

452
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,980
he's gonna come over

453
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,900
and give Jianjun the award himself.

454
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,620
Good!

455
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,820
Is it a good thing?

456
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,020
Jianjun!

457
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,890
Jianjun! Jianjun!

458
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,020
Here he comes!

459
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,890
Jianjun!

460
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,420
-What's wrong? 
-Congratulations.

461
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,220
What's wrong?

462
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,500
What is it?

463
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,140
Your second-class merit!

464
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,700
Your second-class merit was approved!

465
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,620
It's approved!

466
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,540
Good! Thank you!

467
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,700
Thank you, Chief Gao! Thank you, Chief Cheng!

468
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,180
And one more thing,

469
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,020
about the top ten cops.

470
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,540
Thank you, everyone!

471
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,260
-Thank you! -Good! Good!

472
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Second-class merit! Second-class merit!

473
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,790
Let's go outside.

474
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,410
Treat us, Cao!

475
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,300
Treat us!

476
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,090
Okay, okay, okay.

477
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,980
When the Bureau

478
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,060
issued the notice of meritorious service,

479
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,490
they also said they would select the top ten police officers.

480
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,010
They asked us to recommend Cao Jianjun.

481
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,400
I think the second-class merit would be fine.

482
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,460
About the top ten cops, let's put it on hold.

483
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,660
We'll talk about it later.

484
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,260
No, Chief.

485
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,500
We have never had

486
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,180
top ten cops in our station.

487
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,520
The work at the police station

488
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,460
is trivial.

489
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,500
It's hard to train a top ten police officer.

490
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,540
If we don't participate this time,

491
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,380
who knows

492
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,100
when the next one will be.

493
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,020
I don't care.

494
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,860
Listen,

495
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,380
we have to watch ourselves.

496
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,140
We can't think too highly of him.

497
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,980
He'll fall off.

498
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,730
We can't lift him too high.

499
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,180
It's dangerous.

500
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,140
Understand?

501
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,060
All right.

502
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,950
Treat us! Treat us!

503
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,850
Later,

504
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,180
I want you to give everyone a heads up.

505
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,860
Cao Jianjun

506
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,340
achieved a second-class merit.

507
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,300
Don't puff him up

508
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,580
and say those flattering things.

509
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,100
He'll become proud, you know?

510
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,750
I think you're thinking too much.

511
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,410
Am I menopausal?

512
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,620
I... No...

513
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,210
Just listen to me.

514
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,880
No...

515
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,140
No what?

516
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,310
Second-class merit?

517
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,500
Let me see.

518
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,370
This is the second-class merit medal.

519
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,880
And this.

520
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,370
In my opinion,

521
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,860
you deserve a first-class merit.

522
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,460
You have no idea.

523
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,280
It's not easy

524
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,250
for a grass-roots unit to obtain a second-class merit.

525
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,700
Oh, right.

526
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,530
Anyway, this is a good thing,

527
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,220
right?

528
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,500
Of course.

529
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,680
I'm not working tomorrow.

530
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,740
Go.

531
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,180
Let's go to her grandma's house.

532
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
That's not necessary.

533
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,060
I didn't do it for anyone.

534
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,100
I want them to know.

535
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,460
It makes me angry when I think about how my mother treats you.

536
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,980
What does the brother-in-law have?

537
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,500
He just has some money.

538
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,060
Why are you the one

539
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,420
being blamed for his prostitution?

540
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,260
Let's see what they can say this time.

541
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,700
Put on your uniform later

542
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,820
and pin this medal on.

543
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,390
We'll go as soon as I get Yaya back.

544
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,220
Wearing a uniform?

545
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,060
At home?

546
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,140
What's wrong?

547
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,700
I just want you to impress them.

548
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,340
Put on your coat and no one can see inside.

549
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,140
Okay?

550
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,740
Aren't you afraid I'm gonna die of heat?

551
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,230
Hurry up.

552
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,240
How could you think of that?

553
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,460
Hurry up!

554
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,820
Got it!

555
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,340
Mom! Dad!

556
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,780
We're back!

557
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,540
Mom. Dad.

558
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,890
-Jianjun, there you are! -Hello, aunt.

559
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,140
Mom.

560
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,410
Come on, give it to me.

561
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,300
Okay.

562
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,290
Here, here, here.

563
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,740
Mom. Dad.

564
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,020
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

565
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,860
No.

566
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,300
Hui told us that you're coming.

567
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,780
The whole family is waiting for you.

568
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,200
Cong is here, too.

569
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,230
She’s cooking there.

570
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,580
She's cooking her own specialty.

571
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,420
Really?

572
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,220
-Yaya, say hello to grandma. 
-I'll take care of that.

573
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,650
Hello, granny.

574
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,280
Good girl.

575
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,700
I love you.

576
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,930
Yaya, come here, come here.

577
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,250
-Take this and play with your sister. 
-Come on. I'll take care of it.

578
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,180
Let me do it.

579
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,220
Here, here, here.

580
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,450
Let's play inside, okay?

581
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,100
Look at you.

582
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,460
Why did you buy so many things?

583
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,330
It doesn't matter.

584
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,530
Jianjun, stop.

585
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,610
Take off your coat.

586
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,740
Look, look.

587
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,140
Come on, sit here.

588
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,500
I forgot.

589
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,740
Sit there.

590
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,940
Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

591
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,860
What is this?

592
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,380
Mom,

593
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,700
Jianjun achieved a second-class merit.

594
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,260
This... is the medal.

595
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,500
Do you know

596
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,420
that big assault case a while back?

597
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,020
He borrowed the seafood owner's car,

598
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,000
the serial killer.

599
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,860
He injured two men in one day.

600
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:33,970
Your son-in-law

601
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,260
handled that big case.

602
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,050
If it hadn't been for Jianjun,

603
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,100
he might have killed a third man.

604
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,440
Youguang, what did I say?

605
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,030
Don't think you make a lot of money.

606
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,380
You're not even close to him.

607
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,300
You are not as glorious as Jianjun.

608
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,010
Yes, yes, yes.

609
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,180
Congratulations.

610
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,660
Our two sons-in-law,

611
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,060
one is rich and one is famous.

612
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,900
We have everything,

613
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,780
right, old man?

614
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,420
Mom,

615
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,940
pigs fly today!

616
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,480
You don't use my brother-in-law

617
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,280
against Jianjun?

618
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,460
Your mother

619
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,220
is all about money.

620
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,740
She's short-sighted.

621
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,570
You are good?

622
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,080
You have the ability?

623
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,100
Both of our sons-in-law are better than you.

624
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,410
Sit down.

625
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,170
Sit down.

626
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,180
Well, I just love to talk.

627
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,850
Remember

628
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,620
when Youguang went into business?

629
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,660
I talked to your dad about it.

630
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,850
I said someone in our family made money.

631
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,730
If Jianjun had wanted to make money,

632
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,010
we would have said no.

633
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,580
We disagreed.

634
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,940
In our family,

635
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,580
one makes money and the other enforces the law.

636
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,370
If anything happens,

637
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,100
he'll be able to help.

638
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,220
Am I right, Jianjun?

639
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,100
Yes, yes, yes.

640
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,180
Mom, you're right.

641
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,100
Mom, is there something you want to talk about?

642
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,660
Yes.

643
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,700
Youguang.

644
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,490
Tell her.

645
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,580
Mom, you tell them.

646
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,420
Look at you.

647
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,170
Jianjun

648
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,490
is one of us.

649
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,220
Mom,

650
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,100
what is it?

651
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,500
Jianjun,

652
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,900
I did business with an out-of-town company.

653
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,850
I owed them some money.

654
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,490
So they sued me.

655
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,460
No big money.

656
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
It happened last year.

657
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,020
I didn't pay much attention to it.

658
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,140
All of a sudden,

659
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,660
they asked the court to enforce it.

660
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,930
And I had no money in my account,

661
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,950
so they seized my house and car.

662
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,540
I was even put on the list of trust-breakers.

663
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,140
No, brother-in-law.

664
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,050
Why don't you just pay the money back?

665
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,810
I'm having trouble with my cash flow.

666
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,390
It's not about money.

667
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,700
Okay, okay. Go on.

668
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,940
What does it have to do

669
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,940
with Jianjun?

670
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,540
It's mainly about the trust-breakers.

671
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,440
I can't fly now.

672
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,060
I can't take the bullet train and I can't get out of the house.

673
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,810
And I put your sister and niece through it.

674
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,150
They cry and fight with me all day.

675
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,260
You must know someone at the courthouse.

676
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,490
I was wondering if you could bend the rules for me.

677
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,340
Take me off the list of trust-breakers.

678
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,960
Then I'll pay back what I owe as soon as I can.

679
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,980
And everything will work out.

680
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,180
Actually, your brother-in-law didn't think of you at first.

681
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,820
Yes.

682
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,980
He knows a lot of people in his business.

683
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,500
Later I said,

684
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,670
we were not going to ask anyone for help.

685
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Let's ask Jianjun for help.

686
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,700
Right?

687
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,860
Look.

688
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,610
Now,

689
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,670
your brother-in-law is giving you a chance

690
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,300
to help out around the house.

691
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,860
Mom,

692
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,700
the matter of trust-breakers

693
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,580
is a matter for the courts.

694
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,700
I know.

695
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,980
It has nothing to do with us.

696
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,460
That's why we need your help.

697
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,480
Yes, Youguang knows it's a court matter.

698
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,500
Isn't it true that Public Security Bureau, Prosecutors Office and courts

699
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,860
are one and the same?

700
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,190
Why don't you just talk to them?

701
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:11,980
Mom,

702
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,100
that's a misunderstanding of the masses.

703
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,900
How can the Public Security Bureau, Prosecutors Office and courts be one?

704
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,260
We supervise

705
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,540
and restrict each other.

706
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,460
You mean not to do him a favor?

707
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,900
It's not that I don't want to help him.

708
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,340
It's just that I can't help him.

709
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,090
We are separate from the court.

710
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,070
They won't listen to us.

711
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,930
I thought

712
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,040
it wouldn't do you any good

713
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,500
to come home with this medal.

714
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,140
You don't have any power.

715
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,390
Then why do we have a cop in our family?

716
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,340
Listen.

717
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,830
Did you raise Jianjun?

718
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,660
I mean...

719
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,960
He's always...

720
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,200
What have you done for your family?

721
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,580
You're busy doing your own thing all day.

722
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,060
You don't make much money.

723
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,540
And you ask Hui to take care of the family.

724
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,219
She must suffer so much.

725
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,300
There's only one thing

726
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,699
I need you to do for me.

727
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,090
And you can't even do that.

728
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,460
Mom, I want to help.

729
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,980
But...

730
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,290
But I really...

731
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,699
Jianjun,

732
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,020
do you have sweet potatoes in your mouth

733
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,980
or something?

734
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,380
Why can't you speak clearly

735
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,060
when you meet my mom?

736
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,659
No, mom, what do you mean?

737
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,940
You want Jianjun to break the law?

738
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,420
You don't like Jianjun, do you?

739
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,540
Why are you thinking of him now?

740
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,500
Brother-in-law,

741
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,100
didn't you spend

742
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,020
1.2 million yuan on a card?

743
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,730
That was a long time ago.

744
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,060
Wait, wait. Why are you here

745
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,620
pretending to be pathetic?

746
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,860
Let me make it clear.

747
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,929
Jianjun is just an ordinary policeman.

748
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,780
Not to mention he has no power for it,

749
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,820
even if he has,

750
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,020
I won't let him help you.

751
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,650
It's natural to pay debts.

752
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,220
You owe them money. Just pay them back.

753
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,620
You can't come here and embarrass him.

754
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,370
Every time

755
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,060
I say a word, you say ten words.

756
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,070
Tell me who Jianjun is.

757
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,180
Is he from this family?

758
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,100
The family is in trouble.

759
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,140
If he won't help, who will?

760
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,820
Tell me.

761
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,180
We'll help if we can.

762
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,300
The problem is that he shouldn't be helping.

763
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,120
Is it only

764
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,660
my brother-in-law's business that matters to you?

765
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,380
The future of Jianjun

766
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,380
doesn't matter?

767
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,980
Will you be responsible

768
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,020
if Jianjun is punished for breaking the law?

769
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,500
Just say it that way.

770
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,780
It's not that I can help you

771
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,860
but I won't help you.

772
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,340
It's that I can't help you.

773
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,170
-That's it. 
-Yes, we don't have the ability.

774
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,180
Brother-in-law is the only person in the world

775
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,060
who has the ability.

776
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,410
He can make money and prostitute.

777
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,680
How capable he is!

778
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,160
I wonder,

779
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,420
If he's so capable,

780
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,660
why did he owe people money?

781
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,300
Why was he sued?

782
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,850
Stop talking.

783
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,090
Stop what?

784
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,700
We shouldn't have come back today.

785
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,300
Yaya.

786
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,610
Yaya, we got to go home.

787
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,780
Again.

788
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,540
Hui.

789
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,460
What?

790
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,540
Can't you see?

791
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,380
We're not welcome here.

792
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,420
Let's go.

793
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,780
I can't even say a word.

794
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,160
When you talk,

795
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,570
say something useful.

796
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,580
Dad, we're leaving.

797
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,620
Let's go.

798
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,850
Dad. Mom.

799
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,260
Sister. Brother-in-law.

800
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,660
Hui has her mother's temper.

801
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,580
Sorry.

802
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,500
Why do I have a mother like this?

803
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,370
I'm never going back there.

804
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,860
Am I right?

805
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,940
Hui,

806
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,540
there's something on your face.

807
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,980
What?

808
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,060
Don't. Don't.

809
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,610
Don't move. Let me see.

810
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Where?

811
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,740
What are you doing?

812
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,460
The kid is still here and there's a probe here.

813
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,420
I don't care.

814
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,580
I married the best woman in the world.

815
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,580
I'm so lucky.

816
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,510
Let's go home.

817
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,260
Go home.

818
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,020
Cao.

819
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,500
Cao.

820
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,220
Are you busy?

821
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,220
Jianjun.

822
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:18,820
Let's go.

823
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,860
Let's go out to dinner.

824
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,700
Jianjun, why are you back?

825
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,490
Listen,

826
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,860
no one is eating in the cafeteria today.

827
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,140
I'll take you out to dinner.

828
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,700
Dinner?

829
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,740
Cao is buying us a big dinner.

830
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,220
A big dinner? Where are we going for dinner?

831
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,920
Cao.

832
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,460
Second-class merit.

833
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,060
Ordinary food don't satisfy us.

834
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm telling you,

835
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,380
you guys decide what to eat.

836
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,600
Go, go, go.

837
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,490
Zhigang, forget about the tea.

838
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,460
There's good tea in the restaurant.

839
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,900
Some other time.

840
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,090
Not today.

841
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,010
Are you on duty?

842
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,810
Yes, yes, yes. On duty.

843
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,700
No.

844
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,220
Well...

845
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:54,840
How about this?

846
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,620
We keep the money

847
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,010
till the holidays.

848
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,780
Yes, Cao.

849
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,340
You've got the second-class merit.

850
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,340
You'll soon get the first-class merit.

851
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,420
When you achieve the first-class merit,

852
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,780
let's celebrate together, okay?

853
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,220
What are you doing?

854
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,420
Paying for dinner is our rule.

855
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,650
Well, we don't go far away.

856
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,710
We eat nearby.

857
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,740
Okay? Okay?

858
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,740
Go, go, go.

859
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,020
I'm on duty. On duty.

860
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,860
I can't leave. I really can't leave.

861
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,340
No, Ding.

862
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,050
Brother.

863
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,500
I can't get away. I'm on duty.

864
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,940
What do you mean?

865
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,610
You're giving me no respect?

866
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,340
I don't deserve to buy you dinner?

867
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,180
Jianjun, I didn't mean that.

868
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,780
I'm really on duty.

869
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,980
Can I leave?

870
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,680
Yes, there are rules in the police station.

871
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,700
You know that.

872
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,260
How about this?

873
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,900
We'll treat you to dinner sometime.

874
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,020
We congratulate you, okay?

875
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,540
Yes, we treat you to celebrate your success.

876
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,860
Okay? All together.

877
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,140
Okay?

878
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,260
Okay?

879
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,700
We can do it another night.

880
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,620
But we have a deal.

881
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,980
We really need to get together.

882
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,460
-Of course. -Of course.

883
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,740
Is it okay?

884
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,540
-No problem. 
-Don't talk to Jianjun like that.

885
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,580
I need you to

886
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,260
take care of this fight.

887
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,060
Look, things are coming.

888
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,170
Some day.

889
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,020
We'll celebrate you some day.

890
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,220
Lin. Qian.

891
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,100
You two come out with me.

892
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
You are really good.

893
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,260
Cao.

894
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,140
Let's get together later, Jianjun.

895
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,870
Ding,

896
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,940
let's go out for dinner tonight.

897
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,480
Isn't Huan taking care of the business?

898
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,700
Getting out of here for a while won't keep you from making money.

899
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,460
Have some food. Don't just drink.

900
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,330
Fill me up with that white wine.

901
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,340
Fill it up.

902
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,090
Me too.

903
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,020
Fill it up.

904
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,840
Is it all filled?

905
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,900
Is it all filled?

906
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,490
Fill it up. Fill it up. Here, here, here.

907
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,900
Here, here, here, here.

908
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,780
Is the glass full?

909
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,140
Have a drink. Have a drink.

910
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,060
Here, here, here. Here.

911
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,260
Come on. Cheers.

912
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,140
Jianjun got the second-class merit.

913
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,900
Drink up. Drink up. Drink up.

914
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,540
Good.

915
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,220
Good wine.

916
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,240
Good.

917
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,130
Let me ask you.

918
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,140
What do you think

919
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,460
you want to do with your life

920
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,580
as a man?

921
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,820
Money.

922
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,820
Name.

923
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,780
Let me tell you, Liu.

924
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,340
Men really want to be respected.

925
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,180
If you say respect means rich and powerful,

926
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,140
it's not fun.

927
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Hui, Ning,

928
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
am I right?

929
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,180
Yes, yes, yes.

930
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,440
Only the respect you get for your accomplishments

931
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,820
that counts.

932
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,700
Right?

933
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,540
Yes.

934
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,700
-Jianjun is right. -Fill it up. Fill it up.

935
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,930
We need a good policeman like Jianjun.

936
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,220
Yang Shu, there you are!

937
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,900
Who is it?

938
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,780
Come here. Sit down.

939
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,020
I'll carry the chair for you.

940
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Who is it?

941
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,100
Master. Master.

942
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,060
Wait, wait, wait.

943
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,220
How many times have I told you?

944
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,050
Alcohol is strictly prohibited in police stations.

945
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,540
You're talking about business hours.

946
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,700
I was off duty.

947
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,380
No.

948
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,350
The Chief said at the meeting,

949
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,800
the task is too heavy

950
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,180
and no drinking after work.

951
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,890
I know what he said.

952
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,800
Let's put that aside.

953
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,380
Let me tell you.

954
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,100
I'm really happy today.

955
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,460
So I have to drink it.

956
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,000
Come on, come on, come on.

957
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,380
Sit down. Sit down.

958
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,120
Sit down.

959
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,540
Fill up the wine. Is the glass full?

960
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,460
Yes, yes.

961
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,340
Anyone who doesn't fill up today

962
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,990
is looking down on me.

963
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,220
Fill up your cup.

964
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,380
Jianjun.
