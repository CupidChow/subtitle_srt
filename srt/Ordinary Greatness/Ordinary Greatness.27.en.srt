00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,630
Chief.

6
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,220
you have to speak for Jianjun.

7
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,220
Chief,

8
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,880
Jianjun just made a mistake.

9
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,380
We need to help him.

10
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,640
Chief, even if he gets demoted for three grades,

11
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,579
we just can't watch him get sent to prison!

12
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,950
Chief, he just solved a case

13
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,150
and caught a criminal.

14
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,120
His contributions are far more than his mistakes.

15
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,460
Come in.

16
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,650
Chief.

17
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
I heard...

18
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,860
What are you trying to say?

19
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,690
Though I don't like Cao Jianjun,

20
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
for he always seeks to prevail against others,

21
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,110
and always put his own interests first,

22
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,340
I think we should

23
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,560
try to save him anyhow.

24
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,060
Chief,

25
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,140
Jianjun has joined the force for 16 years.

26
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
He's always been in danger and gotten injured many times.

27
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,730
Just because of some of his problems,

28
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,620
we sometimes even didn't give him

29
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,480
the honor and commendation

30
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,399
that he deserved to get.

31
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,380
But look at how he's been working.

32
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,800
We've all seen it.

33
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,800
I know it's serious.

34
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,770
But considering its root cause,

35
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,430
I think it's understandable.

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,130
All the police in the station

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,100
are watching.

38
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,180
If we don't save him,

39
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,780
everyone will be disappointed.

40
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,030
Then who will work like Jianjun in the future?

41
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
Think about it, Chief.

42
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,620
How about you

43
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
asking the director

44
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,530
to let the traffic police be lenient

45
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,840
and just give him a disciplinary punishment?

46
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,970
If you think it's inappropriate for you to do it,

47
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,390
we can write a report in the name of our police station.

48
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,020
Later if there's any responsibility for it,

49
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,760
we can...

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Have a rest.

51
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,260
Chief,

52
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,150
for all these years, Jianjun has been working hard,

53
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,180
and has solved many problems for the people.

54
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,970
You can give him punishments,

55
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,340
but if you get him expelled...

56
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Isn't that too cruel?

57
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,050
Yes.

58
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,350
Everyone may make mistakes.

59
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,140
Exactly.

60
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,620
Even the criminals can get a way out.

61
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,510
The police are humans too.

62
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,060
What do you take the police for?

63
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,930
The ones with a privilege?

64
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,100
You said the police are also humans.

65
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,740
But the police are the ones

66
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,650
who hold the right to enforce the law.

67
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,900
If a law enforcer breaking the law

68
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,460
can get away with punishment,

69
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,180
then who will still be law-abiding in the future?

70
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,090
Today,

71
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,020
let me remind you again.

72
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,220
Regarding Cao Jianjun,

73
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,110
no one is allowed to plead for him from now on.

74
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,350
As for how he will be punished, it depends on the law.

75
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,060
It's not what we can decide.

76
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,220
For the things I just told you,

77
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,560
get them completed as soon as possible.

78
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,200
We can't delay the work for the fourth quarter.

79
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,750
Don't make everyone

80
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,460
look bad.

81
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,690
Meeting adjourned.

82
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,010
Chief.

83
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,160
He should be punished, but we still should help.

84
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,910
Jianjun is our comrade.

85
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,100
Hui.

86
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
Why are you here?

87
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,370
We certainly should come.

88
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,470
Let's go inside.

89
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:59,710
Change your shoes.

90
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,390
Officially

91
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,910
indicted?

92
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,770
Today,

93
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,250
it has officially informed us of it.

94
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,460
Can't his police station or the bureau

95
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,590
plead for him?

96
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,860
What he did can't be pleaded for at all.

97
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,700
How many years is he gonna get? Have you asked about it?

98
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,539
Chief Wang said

99
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,380
at least

100
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,299
a few months' detention.

101
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,070
A few months isn't long.

102
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,820
After he gets released upon completion of a sentence,

103
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,170
what should he do in the future?

104
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,980
You've always been saying

105
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,070
he's a policeman,

106
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,140
he's a policeman.

107
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,370
Now he gets into trouble,

108
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,240
why didn't his identity as a police officer help him out?

109
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,820
Hui, look at you, married to such a man,

110
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,530
and got nothing good.

111
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,400
The whole family has to be taken care of by you alone.

112
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,580
And he even got himself sent to prison just by drinking.

113
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,580
You should have married a man

114
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
either wealthy

115
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,570
or powerful.

116
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,500
But look at him!

117
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,620
He's even more awful than your brother-in-law.

118
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,410
By the way, Hui,

119
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,790
your brother-in-law is no longer on the blacklist.

120
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,250
It needs three million.

121
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,380
He just signed and paid it off.

122
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,610
Mom, we're here to comfort Hui.

123
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,830
Why do you mention him?

124
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,770
I'm telling your sister

125
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,090
to reflect on her marriage.

126
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,580
Hui, look at you.

127
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,340
Look at what your sister eats and wears,

128
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,940
and what you eat and wear.

129
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,500
And now,

130
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,020
your husband will later become an ex-convict.

131
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,800
Mom!

132
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,260
What are you gonna do?

133
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,410
What are you gonna do in the future? Have you thought about it?

134
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,810
Y-Y-You still insist on choosing him?

135
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,340
Look at your brother-in-law.

136
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,380
Stop it.

137
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,290
Mom, what are you doing here today?

138
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,060
I came to see you.

139
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,860
Then why do you keep mentioning my brother-in-law?

140
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,490
If my brother-in-law is so capable,

141
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,000
and can pay off three million easily,

142
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,710
then how could he get blacklisted?

143
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,010
Why did he pull a pitiful face?

144
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm willing to live with Cao Jianjun.

145
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,930
No matter how bad Jianjun is,

146
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,530
he's loyal to me.

147
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,180
He is a good husband.

148
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,460
He is a good father.

149
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,260
How about my sister?

150
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,420
My brother-in-law is rich, that's true.

151
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,420
But he went whoring and cheated on his wife.

152
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,780
The creditors even came to his home to collect debts.

153
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,460
What good did my sister get?

154
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
Sis, you do live a rich life by marrying such a man,

155
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,500
but are you happy?

156
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,890
Don't mention him.

157
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,300
I have to say it.

158
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,910
Mom, I know you always look down on Cao Jianjun?

159
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,660
Now,

160
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,180
he's even to be sent to prison,

161
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,220
you must be very satisfied, right?

162
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,560
But you misjudged your daughter.

163
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,300
I like Cao Jianjun.

164
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,660
Let me make this clear.

165
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,640
No matter how long he will be detained

166
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,720
or how hard our future life will be,

167
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,900
I've acknowledged him as my husband,

168
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,810
I like him,

169
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
and I'll follow him for my whole life.

170
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,220
Mom, it's okay if you don't like him.

171
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,340
I don't care.

172
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,540
But please don't come to my home again

173
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
in the future.

174
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,930
I won't go to your home either.

175
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
Let's just ignore each other.

176
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,040
It's time for me to pick up my child.

177
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,980
You can leave now.

178
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Cong.

179
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,220
She even wouldn't let me talk.

180
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm all thinking

181
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,320
for your own good!

182
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,300
I don't care.

183
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,650
Sister, take her away.

184
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,700
Let's go, mom.

185
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,260
You're really something, huh!

186
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,940
You are capable, okay?

187
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,820
I'm telling you, if you're so capable,

188
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,230
then don't ever ask for help from the Zhou family.

189
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,780
Get out of my way. I'm leaving.

190
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,740
I'll leave.

191
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,720
Chief Wang.

192
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,860
Director said our morning meeting on Monday

193
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,930
might last for a long time.

194
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,020
He asked you to go back first.

195
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,100
He knows what you mean.

196
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,820
Lv,

197
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,030
our morning meeting ended early.

198
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,030
I don't have other things to deal with.

199
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,890
I can just wait here.

200
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,890
Fine. Have a seat.

201
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,300
Have a seat.

202
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,340
Here you are.

203
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,060
Okay, thank you.

204
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,420
Chief Wang, don't be like this.

205
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,290
We heard about what happened to Cao Jianjun.

206
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,940
Director is also upset.

207
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,180
Jianjun shouldn't have failed us.

208
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,450
Anyway, thanks for your understanding.

209
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,940
Sorry for the trouble.

210
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,060
Don't mention it.

211
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,020
Have a seat.

212
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,740
As for the document this time,

213
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,540
I think you must have known about it.

214
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,140
We must carry out

215
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,700
all-round fights against crimes.

216
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,740
For relatively remote places,

217
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,490
we must intensify

218
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,800
the law education among the public.

219
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,410
Don't miss any blind spot.

220
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,140
He insists on waiting for you.

221
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,460
and won't leave.

222
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,620
He's still there.

223
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,380
Director Song.

224
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,730
Don't call me Director Song.

225
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,950
You are my master.

226
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,900
Since I joined the force,

227
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,820
you've been the one teaching me how to be a policeman.

228
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,980
About Jianjun,

229
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
except what you said at my home

230
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,870
last night,

231
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,050
are there any new ideas?

232
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,580
Are there?

233
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,820
Let me know if there are. I'm in a meeting.

234
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,820
What else can I say?

235
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,470
My subordinate committed such a serious crime

236
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,320
and I still shamelessly came to see you...

237
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,260
What else can I say?

238
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,780
I understand the principles.

239
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,180
But I must come.

240
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,460
I must try to

241
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,220
get the last bit of hope for Jianjun.

242
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,100
Song.

243
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,940
Jianjun is your junior.

244
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,180
You know him well.

245
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,780
Can we think of a way

246
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,099
to not let him get sent to prison?

247
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,540
Song.

248
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,540
Master.

249
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,819
I can't assure you that.

250
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,460
It depends on the law.

251
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,210
But in terms of the discipline,

252
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,660
anyone found drunk driving

253
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,930
shall get no pardon.

254
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,440
It has been stipulated long ago.

255
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,500
I don't know

256
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,580
whether he will go to jail,

257
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,260
but he definitely

258
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,090
can't be a policeman anymore.

259
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,200
Master,

260
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,170
it's useless for you to be like this now.

261
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,620
You should have disciplined him more strictly earlier?

262
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,780
That's all

263
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,500
I can say about this.

264
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,560
Master...

265
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,450
I know

266
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,420
you all have your own opinions

267
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,210
over the criminal punishment

268
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,820
that Cao Jianjun got.

269
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:38,980
It's true that

270
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,500
Cao Jianjun ever made a second-class merit.

271
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,900
I even personally awarded him

272
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,360
the medal for his merit.

273
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,580
So what?

274
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,420
Everyone is equal in front of the law.

275
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,660
Merits won't spare you from punishment when you make mistakes.

276
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,980
If there is any difference for the police,

277
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,980
then it's that the punishment will be harder

278
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,180
for the law-enforcer to break the law.

279
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,250
Cao Jianjun broke the law.

280
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,170
Both our bureau

281
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,750
and your station

282
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,770
should be blamed for failing in educating

283
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,460
and disciplining him.

284
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,900
The bureau has decided

285
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,420
to take Cao Jianjun as a negative example,

286
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,760
and conduct thorough education throughout the bureau

287
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,340
to strengthen the bureau's self-discipline.

288
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:53,200
[Balihe Police Station]

289
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,540
You're here.

290
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,420
Morning.

291
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,050
Yang Shu.

292
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,100
Yang Shu.

293
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,450
What are you looking at?

294
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,210
It's time to go on duty!

295
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,550
Mr. Chen, it's time to go on duty.

296
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,630
Dawei, let's go.

297
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,970
Jie.

298
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,490
Come to my office.

299
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,110
Jiwei.

300
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,650
Dashu.

301
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,490
I've been waiting for you. Where have you been?

302
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,180
Let's go.

303
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,260
Come with me.

304
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,700
There are quite a few neighborhoods we need to go today.

305
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,140
There's water leaking in Madam Ding's house.

306
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,860
She's nagging

307
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,940
and has complained about it for many times.

308
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,510
Okay.

309
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,660
Dashu.

310
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,850
I'm fine, so are you.

311
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
I'll talk to you later.

312
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,580
Qizi.

313
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,860
Ask Xu and others to go to the meeting room.

314
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,580
Xu.

315
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,900
Meeting in the conference room.

316
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,650
Coming.

317
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,690
What smells so good?

318
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,220
Let me guess with my eyes closed.

319
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,460
Cold pot skewers, right?

320
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,260
Why do I feel

321
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,540
this scene happened once before?

322
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,540
Where's Yang Shu? Being alone in his room?

323
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,260
I shall talk to him.

324
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,180
Dawei,

325
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,910
why can't you just

326
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,810
leave him some private space?

327
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,020
You know nothing.

328
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,610
Just listen to Jiajia.

329
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,420
Leave him alone.

330
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,360
Okay, thank you.

331
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,190
How is it? Is it good?

332
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,700
It's delicious.

333
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,500
I didn't expect

334
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,780
you would take me to eat pig face.

335
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,930
You really didn't eat your words.

336
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,300
I must keep my words!

337
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,130
You have to do it when you think of it.

338
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,450
Why are you looking at me?

339
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,700
You really don't want some?

340
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,600
I'll drink tea.

341
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,790
It's not the work time. Still be strict with yourself?

342
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,300
One of our capable colleagues

343
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,220
destroyed himself with the alcohol.

344
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,970
Drunk driving!

345
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,660
It not only got his police uniform stripped off,

346
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,850
but also got him sent to prison.

347
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,500
It wasn't totally drunk driving.

348
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,180
He...

349
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,490
It was that

350
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
all the troubles

351
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,930
came to him at once, you know?

352
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,540
Things are unpredictable.

353
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,460
Yes, things are unpredictable.

354
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,220
It's more often seen in the hospital.

355
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,320
There are so many people falling ill and passing away every day.

356
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,470
So, just take it easy.

357
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,900
I just think

358
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,650
he is really a good policeman.

359
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,700
He just made contributions.

360
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,020
How come...

361
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,020
Just...

362
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,940
Maybe this is his fate.

363
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,860
It's not about the fate.

364
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,370
It's about his personality.

365
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,860
Yes, that's right.

366
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,080
Let me tell you.

367
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,220
I once told Cao Jianjun,

368
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,820
that policeman who's now in prison...

369
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,020
I've been telling him,

370
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,780
Cao Jianjun,

371
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
you need to change your personality,

372
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,740
you have to change it,

373
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,700
if you don't,

374
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,900
you'll be in great trouble one day.

375
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,900
See? As expected.

376
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,770
It's been over ten years, but he hasn't changed at all.

377
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,480
If one's personality can be changed,

378
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,980
then so can the fate.

379
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,070
But if the fate can be changed,

380
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,940
then there's no such thing as fate at all.

381
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,310
Old buddy,

382
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,400
I just like talking to you.

383
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,640
It's penetrating.

384
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,480
Enough.

385
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,700
It's not easy for us to have a meal.

386
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,700
Don't be so depressed.

387
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,980
Say something happy.

388
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,370
I really have nothing happy to say,

389
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,180
nor could I find someone else to talk with.

390
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,750
Then just say as your wish.

391
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,350
Go ahead. I'm listening.

392
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,430
You listen, and I say.

393
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,820
I told you before that

394
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,620
four young people

395
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,380
came to our police station, right?

396
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,050
There's a top student from Peking University.

397
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,060
He was the disciple of Cao Jianjun,

398
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,530
that policeman who's now in prison.

399
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,490
After what happened to his master,

400
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,140
the bureau suddenly

401
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,270
had an important investigation,

402
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,980
which needed someone good at writing.

403
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,940
The bureau wanted him

404
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,420
and asked me if I agreed with it.

405
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,100
Then did you agree?

406
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,060
How can I...

407
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,800
For the bureau,

408
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,660
it's seemingly being nice,

409
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,540
but I know what it means.

410
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,380
It's just worrying that this treasure

411
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,930
may also get into trouble

412
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,260
if he keeps staying in our station.

413
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,810
You're a little anxious?

414
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,620
You think too much.

415
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,420
I'm just anxious.

416
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,300
Buddy, give me some advice.

417
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,180
Do you think I should agree

418
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
or disobey the order?

419
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,910
Can you disobey the order?

420
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,500
I certainly dare not disobey the order.

421
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,300
But

422
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,860
the director was my apprentice before.

423
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,530
I can ask him to seek some wiggle room.

424
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,740
Old buddy,

425
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,820
for what happened in the bureau and in your station,

426
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,020
you seldom talked a lot about it.

427
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,620
And I dare not to give you casual advice.

428
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,580
I can only tell you how I feel.

429
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,700
We just mentioned that everyone can get old, fall ill and finally dies.

430
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,060
Things are unpredictable.

431
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,380
You'll understand it after reading enough of it.

432
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,860
The thing is that

433
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,820
when you are capable of it,

434
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,660
then just try your best,

435
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,580
but when you're not,

436
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,420
then just let it be.

437
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,500
Capable of it...

438
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,980
Not capable of it...

439
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,780
Chief, what’s the matter?

440
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,620
Chief.

441
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,140
Chief.

442
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,580
Instructor, Chief, are we gonna have a meeting?

443
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,340
What’s the subject for today?

444
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,980
Have a seat.

445
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,770
Sit.

446
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,010
Excuse me, Chief.

447
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,700
Chief Gao, Chief Cheng, Instructor.

448
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Yang Shu is here.

449
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,730
Yang Shu.

450
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,570
I have

451
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,890
a very good thing.

452
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,980
The Municipal Bureau

453
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,300
will conduct

454
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,740
a special research.

455
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,620
And it will select a talent

456
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,100
from each police station.

457
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,620
The talent should be recommended by each police station.

458
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,530
For our station,

459
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,840
the Municipal Bureau directly selected Yang Shu,

460
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,550
saying that Yang Shu has an education background in law,

461
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,620
is good at writing,

462
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,740
and during the internship,

463
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,340
he had good performance.

464
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,140
Well...

465
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,900
The Municipal Bureau also

466
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,610
asked for our opinions,

467
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,260
saying that if we agree to get Yang Shu transferred...

468
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,380
I thought,

469
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,940
it would be a good thing.

470
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,940
This is a good thing, right?

471
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,420
Firstly, it proves

472
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,700
Yang Shu is a capable person,

473
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,570
a talent that's wanted by all.

474
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,820
Secondly,

475
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,460
the Balihe police station

476
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,610
must think for the greater good,

477
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,360
right?

478
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,180
Yang Shu, just do this.

479
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,140
Go through the handover procedure

480
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,540
and report to the Municipal Bureau.

481
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,120
It’s a good thing.

482
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,930
Well, Instructor, Director Cheng,

483
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,610
you two help Yang Shu

484
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,910
complete the handover procedure

485
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,990
and send a car

486
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,140
to take him to the Municipal Bureau.

487
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,260
Meeting adjourned.

488
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,130
Have you heard it?

489
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,090
Dr. Yang Shu will be transferred to the bureau.

490
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,330
At this time...

491
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,240
Cao Jianjun just went to jail,

492
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,420
I guess...

493
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,220
The bureau may not trust our station.

494
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,000
Well,

495
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,290
I've grown quite fond of that guy.

496
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,940
He's quite simple.

497
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,460
He is a good guy.

498
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,170
Yes.

499
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,810
Come out and talk.

500
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,340
You want to talk about Yang Shu, right?

501
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,380
You heard about it too?

502
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,180
I not only heard about it,

503
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,660
I also confirmed it with my master.

504
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,100
What are they doing?

505
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,850
It's said that the bureau asked to get him transferred.

506
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,730
What about Dashu?

507
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,460
I didn't see him when I came back.

508
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,900
I haven't seen him since I heard the news.

509
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,380
I asked where Yang Shu was

510
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,260
in WeChat group this afternoon,

511
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,350
but none of you replied.

512
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,430
How would I know what you are doing?

513
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,770
I guess Dawei thought so too.

514
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
He and his master have been on duty.

515
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,110
I supposed he missed the message.

516
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
What should we do?

517
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,220
What else can we do?

518
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,500
It's not a bad thing.

519
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,340
After we go back tonight,

520
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,460
let's happily hold a farewell party for Yang Shu.

521
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,060
Then tell Dawei in the WeChat group.

522
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,100
Let him come back early after he's done with the work.

523
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,540
Okay.

524
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,780
Let's go.

525
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,420
So suddenly...

526
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,980
Dawei,

527
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,660
why did you buy so many things?

528
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,980
I was ordered by Xia Jie and Zhao Jiwei

529
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,940
to buy some vegetables for tonight's hot pot

530
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,740
to bid farewell to Yang Shu.

531
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,180
Bid farewell to Yang Shu?

532
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,130
He has already left!

533
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,700
He left?

534
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,540
He came back in the afternoon and cleaned up his room for a while.

535
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,830
Then he pulled the luggage and told me

536
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,219
he was to work in the bureau for a while,

537
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,630
and it could be inconvenient to come here.

538
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,179
I thought you all knew.

539
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,620
Xia Jie, Dawei, Jiwei.

540
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,219
I'm going to the bureau.

541
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,889
I want to get used to the new environment in advance.

542
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,690
I shall not get together with you today.

543
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,050
I'll come back often.

544
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,210
Yang Shu

545
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,780
left without saying goodbye.

546
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,300
Fine, good for him.

547
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,900
No wonder that he kept being silent in the WeChat group.

548
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,620
He left so quietly.

549
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,140
Maybe it was for avoiding us.

550
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,790
Mom, did you eat on the plane?

551
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,180
I ate a piece of bread.

552
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,090
Is Dali fun?

553
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,450
No.

554
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,740
Don't you always think it's good?

555
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,860
When did I say that?

556
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,660
Fine.

557
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,820
You're back. Let's stop here.

558
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,780
It's meaningless to come back.

559
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,940
You are so busy at work every day.

560
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,940
You don't have time to accompany me.

561
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,260
Mom!

562
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,980
Why didn't the bureau

563
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,340
send a car to pick me up?

564
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,360
We have our own car.

565
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,850
Why must we bother the bureau?

566
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,310
The car is in the parking lot.

567
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,090
Let's go.

568
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,180
Mom.

569
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,820
Are you asleep?

570
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,410
I shall take a nap.

571
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,850
Hello, auntie.

572
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,860
My mom wasn't in a good mood when she came back.

573
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,740
Did something happen to her over there?

574
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,810
Jie.

575
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,820
It's because of Mr. Liang.

576
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,450
I think they two are very likely to break up.

577
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,370
Why?

578
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,940
Mr. Liang seems to have someone else.

579
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,870
I see.

580
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,460
It's not his fault.

581
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,420
At first, I could see he was quite passionate.

582
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,060
But your mother was always so proud.

583
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,590
Then Mr. Liang went to find someone else,

584
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,910
He also finished his work here in advance and went back.

585
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,980
Okay.

586
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,940
Thank you, auntie. I got it.

587
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,060
Jie.

588
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,420
Mr. Liang.

589
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,380
Jie, why are you here?

590
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,340
Come, let's talk in the shade.

591
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,260
It's hot here.

592
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,520
I just brought my mom back

593
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,820
from Dali yesterday.

594
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,580
Thank you

595
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,540
for taking care of my mom in Dali.

596
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,780
I'm here to express my gratitude.

597
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,140
Your mom is back?

598
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,100
Didn't she say she would spend the winter there?

599
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,620
She had this plan.

600
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,900
But I don't know why

601
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,940
she suddenly wanted to come back.

602
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,820
I only found out that you had also come back

603
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,060
after my mom came back.

604
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,540
Mr. Liang,

605
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,420
how is your relationship

606
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,460
with the new lady you found?

607
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,700
She was introduced by someone else.

608
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,570
I haven't decided it yet.

609
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,130
To be selfish,

610
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,940
my mom can't find someone better than you

611
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,920
in this world.

612
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,900
If you two miss each other,

613
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,940
it will not be your regret,

614
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,420
but hers.

615
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,980
I know.

616
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,260
Although your mother rejected me,

617
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,990
she actually relies on me in love.

618
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,880
I also don't want to let her go.

619
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,940
At first,

620
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,100
I was just hoping to repay your father's kindness to me.

621
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,170
Later, I felt pity for your mother.

622
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,000
Thanks for your endeavor, Jie.

623
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,530
If your mom is willing to be with me,

624
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,700
it will certainly be fine.

625
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,620
But...

626
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,460
I understand.

627
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,340
Mr. Liang, I'll ask my mom to reply you as soon as possible.

628
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,380
Okay.

629
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,540
Mom, you just came back. Have some fruit.

630
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,930
Our place is not as good as Dali, huh?

631
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,940
There's even no good show to watch.

632
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,460
Then let's not watch it.

633
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,490
What are you doing?

634
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,140
Mom, you've been away for so long.

635
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,100
I miss you too.

636
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,740
Let's not watch TV today

637
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,700
Let's have a chat.

638
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,740
Are you going to talk about that guy surnamed Liang again?

639
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,450
Mom, Mr. Liang is nice.

640
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,050
Why do you call him like this?

641
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,140
He is nice?

642
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,940
Jie.

643
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,050
Do you really dislike your mom so much?

644
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,260
Are you so eager to get your mother married?

645
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,500
Not at all!

646
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,340
I've been thinking for you

647
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,980
and protecting you.

648
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,420
I sacrificed everything for you.

649
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,100
But in the end,

650
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,060
you either moved

651
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,180
or wanted me to marry that guy surnamed Liang.

652
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,540
Tell me,

653
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,260
are you really so eager to get rid of me?

654
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,940
What are you thinking?

655
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,260
We've been living together for so many years.

656
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,980
How could I want to get rid of you?

657
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,460
Mom, I'm afraid you'll be lonely.

658
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,730
But I've been alone for so many years.

659
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,530
Besides, I still have you.

660
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,940
Mom,

661
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,820
I'll only get busier and busier at work.

662
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,820
And I'm already 22 years old.

663
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,540
Fine, a grown girl can't be kept!

664
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
I know you're 22.

665
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,490
Are you trying to say

666
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,980
you want to get married

667
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,690
and you need to date,

668
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,500
right?

669
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,660
I just want to say

670
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,700
I also want my own life.

671
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,350
What do you mean?

672
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,140
To be with mom

673
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,980
