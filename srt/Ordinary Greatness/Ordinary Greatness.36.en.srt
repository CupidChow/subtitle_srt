He wanted to come too.

Didn't Yaya come?

15
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,039
I didn't let her come.

Zhou Hui has been spoiled since young,

122
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,290
and it was really not easy for her

to survive the six months.

124
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,970
You should cherish her.

125
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,380
You should cherish Zhou Hui, your child,

126
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,980
and your family,

127
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,160

Yes.

130

Thank you, Chief.

131
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,260
Since it's busy in the station,

132
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,540
I shall not take you upstairs.

133
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,090
Go home first.

134
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,300
Help Zhou Hui more in housework

135
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,200
and share her burdens.

136
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,700

137

See,

Jianjun

142
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,580
is almost 40,

143
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,210
and has gotten criminal punishment,

144
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,340
I don't think it's easy for him to find a job.

145
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,860
Should we figure out a way

146
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,660
to help him?

147
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,060
He's been a policeman for half of his life

148
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,520
and has no other skills.

149
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,580
What else can he do?

150
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,140
How about this?

151
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,580
Go to other precincts to ask

152
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,020
if there's any position

153
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,140
like a security captain.

154
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,100
Maybe he can

155
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,900
do this.

156
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,980
Why other precincts?

157
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,460
Can't we just find him a position in our precinct?

158
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,940
We all know Jianjun.

159
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,700
If he's in our precinct,

160
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,330
we can take care of him.

161
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,020
We can't keep him in our precinct.

162
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,080
We should help him let go.

164
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,420
call Chief Qi

of the police station on the Miaoqian Street.

166
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,140
There are

167
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,060
many newly-opened malls there.

168
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,980
They must be in need of an experienced security guard.

169
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,220
Remember,

170
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,060
be sure to find a position

171
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,420
as a security captain.

172
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,200
Otherwise, if he earns too little,

173
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,140
it's not enough for him to live.

174
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,580
Alright, that's it.

175
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,260
Those were your life savings with my mom.

176
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,970
Officer,

177
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,580
I've called the police several times.

178
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,460
Can you

179
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,940
help us first?

180
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,460
We've been disturbed by the ones upstairs every day.

181
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,980
You spent your whole life in saving them...

182
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,540
Behave yourself.

183
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,380
How could you just transfer the money to them?

184
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,770
Besides,

185
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,650
could you understand what was said on the website page?

186
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,780
It was all in English.

187
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,620
It's understandable for you to do so if you knew English.

188
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,340
But since you don't know English,

189
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,180
how could you just transfer the money to them, dad?

190
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,750
What if we can't get the money back?

191
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,210
How should my mom and I face others in the future,

192
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,960
dad?

193
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,280
Be good.

194
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,550
What do you think?

195
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,140
The police will get the money back for us.

196
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,890
Nothing's found yet?

197
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,700
Nothing unusual.

198
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,380
He drove around every day

199
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,700
and sometimes went to a foot massage store.

200
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,920
He hasn't brought any girl home lately.

201
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,620
This is the record of where he went?

202
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,020
How could you be so imprudent, dad?

203
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,180
-The child is lost! What should we do? -You and my mom have spent your whole life in saving them!

204
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,830
If your son comes back and asks for it,

205
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,350
-how will you explain it to your son? -Let's go explain it to the police.

206
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,850
-What's wrong with you, old man? -Listen to me, go explain it to the police.

207
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,620
Damn...

208
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,260
If you don't explain it to the police,

209
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,900
we can't get the money back.

210
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,970
Master.

211
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,620
Mr. Cao!

212
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,420
Jianjun?

213
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,120
Why are you here?

214
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,340
Cheng, Dawei.

215
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,740
What's the matter?

216
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,580
Nothing.

217
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,660
I just want to have a look...

218
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,100
To have a look...

219
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,740
I want...

220
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,170
Can I go in and have a look?

221
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,190
Jianjun, what are you talking about?

222
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,579
This is your home.

223
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,569
I'll go open the door.

224
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,900
Jianjun.

225
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,849
Just go on with your work.

226
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,030
Don't let me keep you.

227
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,010
Doesn't matter.

228
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,140
I can do it myself.

229
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,579
Cheng, just go on with your work.

230
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,690
Dawei, sorry for bothering you.

231
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,860
I can open it myself.

232
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,290
Mr. Cao.

233
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,340
The password has been changed.

234
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,420
Come in.

235
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,330
Comrade Cao Jianjun

236
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,250
has firm faith and is loyal to his duty.

237
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:26,270
[Award Ceremony for Meritorious Service]

238
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,820
He's firmly kept in mind the principles and devoted himself to the people.

239
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,610
He is brave and responsible.

240
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,290
He's made great contributions

241
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,380
to the social stability of the precinct.

242
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,050
This photo is still hanging here?

243
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:40,980
Yes.

244
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,220
This is the honor of the station,

245
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,670
as well as yours.

246
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,250
Chen,

247
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,130
I'm leaving.

248
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,180
Jianjun.

249
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,270
Take care.

250
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,210
Live well

251
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,100
for your family.

252
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,780
Morning, Dawei.

253
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,420
Morning.

254
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,930
It must be the traffic jam during the morning peak.

255
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,910
Sir, how long will it take?

256
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,980
You just came off the night shift, right?

257
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,660
Get some sleep in the car.

258
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,700
It's you!

259
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,380
I had recognized you

260
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,540
before you got in the car.

261
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,720
What a small world!

262
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,220
Weren't you a bus driver?

263
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,180
Why do you become a driver for online car-hailing service?

264
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,660
For earning some extra money.

265
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,700
My dad was in debt because of the medical treatment

266
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,700
and has passed away.

267
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,370
Didn't you donate...

268
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,670
I originally was to get my liver transplanted to him.

269
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,610
But the examination showed that I'm not a match.

270
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,540
But the surgery was done.

271
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
How was it done?

272
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,120
There happened to be a matching liver.

273
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,100
It was originally for someone else.

274
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,050
But that person's condition worsened

275
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,180
and he just passed away.

276
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,420
And it didn't match those in front of my dad.

277
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,860
Then my dad just got it.

278
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,820
Wasn't that good?

279
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,460
Well,

280
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,100
it may be the fate.

281
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,140
We got the liver match.

282
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,010
But there was rejection just a few days after the operation.

283
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,600
It got worse

284
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,610
and took his life.

285
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,890
I'm so sorry to hear about it.

286
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,900
It's not that bad.

287
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,980
It's not bad for me

288
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,420
to be a driver for the online car-hailing service.

289
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,300
I can meet different people every day,

290
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,780
listen to various issues,

291
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,210
and talk about different things.

292
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,220
It can make me be in a good mood.

293
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,500
When people are in a good mood,

294
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,660
everything will be fine.

295
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,990
Being in debt

296
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,250
is not a big deal.

297
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,360
I've already paid off many of the debts.

298
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,740
Do you think

299
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,030
it's good or bad?

300
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,170
Do you still drive the bus?

301
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:45,950
Yes.

302
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,040
That's my job.

303
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,660
This is just a part-time job.

304
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,660
Where is it?

305
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,140
Lanming Building.

306
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,300
It's newly built on the Liyuan Street.

307
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,790
You may not know.

308
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,810
There are all internet companies inside.

309
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,250
It even requires facial recognition to enter the building.

310
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,620
It's definitely dignified to work there.

311
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,020
What's the position?

312
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,130
The position you told me to find for him.

313
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:14,980
Security captain.

314
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,260
But it's just a deputy.

315
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,270
Why is it just a deputy?

316
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,740
Chief, you don't know.

317
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,290
A security team

318
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,780
only needs one captain.

319
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,100
There's no deputy captain at all.

320
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,090
I forced Qi

321
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,360
to beg for leniency.

322
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,900
And they set up such a position specially for Jianjun.

323
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,320
How much can he earn a month?

324
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,050
Not much, over 5,000 yuan.

325
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,060
Tell Jianjun

326
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,940
to work hard

327
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,570
to get promoted as soon as possible

328
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,770
so that he can earn more money.

329
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,250
Actually, Zhou Hui is quite happy.

330
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,660
She said after Jianjun came back,

331
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,540
he seldom went out of home,

332
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,740
just staying in the house every day.

333
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,970
She said if he could get a job,

334
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,220
even if he couldn't earn much,

335
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,970
she still would be happy about it.

336
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,500
Jianjun really has a good wife.

337
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,370
Chief.

338
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,170
Qiancheng.

339
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,060
Chief Gao.

340
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,380
Chief, you're here.

341
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,220
Instructor.

342
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,920
I have important good news

343
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,430
to tell you.

344
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,380
Chief Gao, tell them.

345
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,800
Yesterday, through Interpol,

346
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,640
the prime culprit of the fraudulent group we cracked

347
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,620
was arrested abroad.

348
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,300
Bravo!

349
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,460
According to reliable information,

350
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,300
in this campaign

351
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,730
against the telecom fraud,

352
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,770
the fraudulent group we cracked

353
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,770
is the biggest one.

354
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,880
The money involved is also the most.

355
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,260
Its fraud has covered

356
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,800
many countries in Southeast Asia.

357
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,420
The money involved has reached tens of millions.

358
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,980
Although we only recovered a few million,

359
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,050
we anyhow recovered it.

360
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,160
Chief Gao just now

361
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,870
got highly praised by the bureau.

362
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:08,700
Now,

363
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,940
I'd like to let you know it.

364
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,950
You'll also be commended for your work.

365
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,570
Chief, shouldn't we celebrate?

366
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,250
Right, Chief.

367
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,860
Xia Jie, someone is making trouble in the household registration center.

368
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,680
Go and have a look.

369
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,460
Sir, can we talk?

370
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,180
I'm not going.

371
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,560
I'll talk here.

372
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,700
Can we talk inside?

373
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,050
Don't disturb others' work here.

374
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,860
My poor daughter.

375
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,810
You died with a grievance.

376
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,040
The police are disregarding human lives now.

377
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,400
Sir, stop arguing here.

378
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,790
Let's talk inside, okay?

379
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,830
Who will redress the grievance for her?

380
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,930
Sir, don't cry.

381
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,770
What happened to your daughter?

382
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,610
Tell me.

383
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,980
There was a grievance in my daughter's death.

384
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,490
If you mean your daughter died of homicide,

385
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,310
then you should go to the service center.

386
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,580
This is the household registration center.

387
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,530
They are two different centers.

388
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,770
You guys here are exactly the ones who I came for.

389
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,420
Calm down.

390
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,020
Tell me what happened.

391
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,570
What happened?

392
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,350
You did it yourselves.

393
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,170
Now are you asking me about it?

394
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,750
My poor daughter.

395
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,850
I was going to give her an autopsy,

396
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,220
but your police station just

397
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,980
let that bastard get my daughter cremated.

398
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,370
I'm the one holding her household register.

399
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,020
How could that bastard be allowed

400
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,060
to cancel her household registration?

401
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,140
Tell me,

402
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,260
how did you cooperate with him?

403
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,190
How did you collude?

404
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,670
You burnt my daughter's corpse to destroy the evidence.

405
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,740
You know?

406
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,820
Then that can be very serious if you say so.

407
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,630
What you said can be a criminal case.

408
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,780
If you have evidence,

409
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,580
I can take you

410
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,860
to the service center to report the case now.

411
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,500
I'm not going. I don't trust you.

412
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,980
You colluded with each other.

413
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,570
I don't trust them.

414
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:13,970
What happened?

415
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,830
It was during the last few days before Ms. Wang gave birth.

416
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,340
You were still absent at that time.

417
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,480
Ms. Wang handled the procedures and I implemented it.

418
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,410
I remember the date clearly.

419
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,100
Around 9 a.m. on the 16th,

420
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,050
a man named Xu Jianshi

421
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,060
said that

422
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,950
his wife had died of disease for three days,

423
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,380
and he had to cancel her household registration to cremate her.

424
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,090
Ms. Wang and I saw that he had all the materials required,

425
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,700
and he also had a death certificate from the hospital.

426
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,160
What about the household register?

427
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,860
He said his wife's household register

428
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,330
had been in his father-in-law's house

429
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,440
and was not held by him.

430
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,620
But he had the property card, ID card,

431
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,580
and their marriage certificate.

432
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,110
He said his father-in-law went on a trip

433
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,650
and wouldn't be back soon.

434
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,040
He wanted his wife

435
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,410
to rest in peace as soon as possible,

436
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,300
thus hoping to finish all the procedures.

437
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,220
Without the household register,

438
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,780
how could you cancel his wife's household registration?

439
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,290
There were similar cases before.

440
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,820
The procedures were complete,

441
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,020
and other certificates could be handed in later.

442
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,190
And he said

443
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,700
once his father-in-law came back,

444
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,540
he would hand in the household register immediately.

445
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,830
He didn't look like a bad guy,

446
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,900
so Ms. Wang agreed to handle it for him.

447
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,920
Xia Jie.

448
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,640
That old man suddenly left.

449
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,940
He left?

450
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,390
Yes.

451
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,820
I saw him sitting there alone,

452
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,260
and I was afraid that he might disturb others.

453
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,860
But for an instant

454
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,600
he just disappeared.

455
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,000
Get back to work.

456
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,830
Don't be affected.

457
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,920
I'll tell it to Instructor.

458
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,590
Okay.

459
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,210
Officer Xia, will I be fired?

460
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,560
Then I'll be doomed.

461
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,020
Don't worry. It's also my responsibility.

462
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,140
Go.

463
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you looking for me?

464
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,150
No.

465
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,290
Hao,

466
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,740
can you get me

467
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,390
the surveillance video of the household registration center?

468
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,470
I need to see what happened there after 9 a.m. on the 16th.

469
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,260
Okay.

470
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,940
Thank you.

471
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,620
What happened?

472
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,970
You'll see.

473
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,810
Most importantly, that man looked

474
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,710
like a loyal husband.

475
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,620
When I was handling the procedures

476
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,730
for canceling his wife's household registration,

477
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,460
he cried terribly

478
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,590
when seeing his wife's photo.

479
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,600
The video shows nothing abnormal on that day.

480
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,440
Xia Jie, why are you here?

481
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,700
I was looking for you.

482
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,540
Instructor,

483
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,820
I was about to report to you.

484
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,090
No need to report to me.

485
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,710
The "12345" hot-line of the bureau

486
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,980
reached me directly just now.

487
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,340
We were complained to have colluded with someone

488
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,080
and canceled the household registration of that person's daughter.

489
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,690
What happened?

490
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,140
This is what I wanted to report to you.

491
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,540
Here's the thing.

492
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,860
The man on the screen is Xu Jianshi.

493
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,250
He came to cancel his wife's household registration in the morning on the 16th.

494
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,590
His wife passed away three days before that day.

495
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,820
He was in a hurry to cremate her.

496
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,310
But just now,

497
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,870
the father of his wife came,

498
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,630
saying her daughter's death was unknown

499
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,450
and his son-in-law urgently canceled her household registration

500
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,890
for destroying the evidence.

501
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,390
That would be a criminal case.

502
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,930
Has the household register been canceled?

503
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,390
Let me finish.

504
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,580
I think it was not necessarily for destroying the evidence.

505
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,950
But there must be a story.

506
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,750
The key to solving the problem

507
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,740
is to find Xu Jianshi first.

508
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,140
Secondly,

509
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,990
we did have our problems

510
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,850
over the procedures of canceling the household registration.

511
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
What problem?

512
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,260
Xu Jianshi didn't show

513
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,980
her wife's household register at that time.

514
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,340
But we just agreed to his demand

515
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,310
out of sympathy.

516
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,050
Who did it?

517
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,210
It doesn't matter.

518
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,010
I'm responsible for what happened.

519
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,050
-Xia Jie. -Instructor, please give me some time.

520
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,050
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

521
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,180
Okay, as soon as possible.

522
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,650
Xia Jie.

523
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,520
It's okay.

524
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:11,540
By the way, Dawei,

525
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,159
if I don't have enough time,

526
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,469
I may need your help.

527
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,179
Go ahead.

528
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,969
I may need you to go to the hospital

529
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,800
to verify the death certificate of his wife.

530
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,440
No problem.

531
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,150
Thank you.

532
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,090
Hello.

533
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,989
-Officer. -Did you call the police?

534
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,580
-Yes, I did. -Where did it happen?

535
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,560
On the third floor.

536
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,409
Officer, sorry

537
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,719
for making you come here.

538
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,780
But it has actually been solved.

539
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,739
Why?

540
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,560
Here's the thing.

541
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,540
We have

542
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,060
an experienced security guard here.

543
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,239
Before I finished reporting the case,

544
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,989
he had just solved it.

545
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:47,909
Where is he?

546
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,440
H-H-He's over there!

547
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,900
He's giving the two sides...

548
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,250
Besides, what if you had made each other seriously injured...

549
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,080
Ask him to sign it.

550
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,750
Okay.

551
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,070
You would be detained even if it's a minor injury,

552
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,230
A minor injury

553
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,730
can also make you be sentenced to three years at most in prison.

554
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Then what effects will it have on your future life?

555
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,190
Have you thought about it?

556
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,130
Is it worth it?

557
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,060
There can always be conflicts between people.

558
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,770
Have you thought about it?

559
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,600
Officer...

560
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,340
Just face it and solve it.

561
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,510
He's back?

562
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,230
Yes.

563
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,620
He worked there for less than a week

564
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,430
and resigned without getting the salary.

565
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,180
He came back to a mall in our precinct

566
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,490
and became an ordinary security guard.

567
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,000
I heard from Director Gao that

568
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,460
the salary is less than 4,000 yuan per month.

569
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,460
Try to move.

570
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,900
I think we should just let Jianjun do as he wishes.

571
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,170
After all, he's worked in our station for over a decade.

572
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,730
He can't bear to leave us.

573
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,780
And if he works

574
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:06,970
in our precinct,

575
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,170
it can be convenient for us to care for him, right?

576
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,420
After all, we've been bros for years.

577
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,500
Jianjun.

578
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,520
Chief.

579
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,530
Have some water.

580
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,580
Chief,

581
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,540
don't get me wrong.

582
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,300
I'm not here for anything else.

583
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,050
It's just for being closer to home.

584
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,230
I won't trouble the station.

585
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,510
Jianjun,

586
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,040
I've been having a backache

587
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,380
again in recent days.

588
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,460
I had to go to the hospital every day.

589
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,540
I tried therapies like acupuncture and Tuina every day.

590
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,260
To think it over,

591
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,840
I'm already 55 years old now.

592
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,340
I'm leaving the Balihe police station by the end of the year

593
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,410
to be an investigator in the bureau,

594
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,760
retiring from the leading post.

595
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,740
Chief, you've worked hard all your life.

596
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,800
You should get some rest.

597
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,490
Maybe I'm really old.

598
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm getting homesick.

599
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,570
I used to be addicted to working overtime.

600
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,610
But now I always try my best to avoid working overtime.

601
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,780
When I go home,

602
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,970
I always ask your sister-in-law to make me some porridge

603
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,080
and some side dishes.

604
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,620
Then I can have some porridge

605
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,300
while listening to her chattering

606
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,190
about various things,

607
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,450
like our son is disobedient,

608
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,170
and she doesn't like her daughter-in-law and so on.

609
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,250
Such moments really make me feel at ease,

610
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,380
which is beyond words.

611
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,620
So, Jianjun,

612
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,860
for everyone's whole life,

613
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,720
whether you're successful or not,

614
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,010
what you have in the end

615
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,850
will only be your own home,

616
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,700
your wife and your children.

617
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,820
You're lucky

618
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,240
to have such a good wife like Zhou Hui.

619
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,620
You are really...

620
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,560
When you were in trouble,

621
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,590
she not only took care of the family,

622
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,810
but also stuck up for you.

623
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,960
When you worked in the police station,

624
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,260
you totally devoted yourself to the work.

625
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,490
You worked overtime every day.

626
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,420
You're really lucky

627
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,920
to have such a good wife like Zhou Hui.

628
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,980
Jianjun,

629
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,650
listen to me,

630
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,980
just forget about being a police officer.

631
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,340
It'll never happen again.

632
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,150
Just find a job with high salary,

633
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,450
live a good life,

634
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,020
and support your family.

635
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,760
Do you hear me?

636
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,270
Chief.

637
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,560
How can I forget?

638
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,740
Can I?

639
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,750
You have to.

640
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,260
Sister Xia Jie.

641
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,340
Sister Xia.

642
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,930
Who are you calling sister?

643
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,670
I call you sister to show your status.

644
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,430
Get away!

645
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,100
Zhao Jiwei, you didn't see

646
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,100
Xia's glorious image

647
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,320
when she was solving the problem.

648
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,070
She did it in a really outright and decisive manner.

649
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,810
Fine, stop touting me.

650
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,660
Jiwei, look at him.

651
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,500
He's come back to life, right?

652
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,860
When something happens,

653
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,000
it can immediately arouse his sense of justice,

654
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,020
and make him become so vigorous.

655
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,340
You too.

656
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,840
Have some meat to get more energy.

657
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,620
Thank you.

658
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,150
Can you two stop touting each other?

659
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,580
Can you not treat me like air?

660
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,150
Who treated you as air?

661
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,720
Aren't we talking to you?

662
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,420
Yeah.

663
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,070
Yeah.

664
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,580
Yeah.

665
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,250
Look at you two.

666
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,300
If I'm not air, what am I?

667
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,100
Xia Jie, let me tell you.

668
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,510
When you were shouldering the responsibility for others' mistakes

669
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,100
in front of the instructor,

670
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,660
I really wanted to stop you.

671
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,100
That was not it.

672
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,590
Though I indeed did so

673
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,420
for preventing Cui from being expelled,

674
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,380
I really thought

675
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,860
it was also my fault.

676
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,140
It was our fault for agreeing to cancel the household registration.

677
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,180
But when I saw Xu Jianshi in person later,

678
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,740
I felt more relieved,

679
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,100
seeing him loving his wife so much.

680
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,100
Besides,

681
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,340
that old man came to the police station again.

682
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,150
He even brought a woman like that.

683
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,860
From his words, I could tell that

684
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,060
he didn't care about her daughter's life at all.

685
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,520
What he cared about was just the house property.

686
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,170
Then I suddenly knew what to do.

687
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,420
Not bad, Xia Jie.

688
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,020
You've grown up.

689
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,330
Be careful, I'll report you to Chief.

690
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,860
Anyway,

691
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,170
I should thank you.

692
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,500
for the death certificate

693
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,300
and everything you got from the hospital.

694
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,190
And...

695
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,460
That old man has never

696
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,800
gone to the hospital to see his daughter.

697
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,620
That's the key point.

698
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,020
It made the old man silenced right away.

699
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,020
What's wrong?

700
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,780
What's wrong?

701
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,860
Don't allow us to eat?

702
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,540
Didn't you have a good chat?

703
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,940
Keep chatting!

704
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,080
Continue to take me as air!

705
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,060
Sir,

706
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,760
are you jealous?

707
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,560
Stop it.

708
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,430
Stop it.

709
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,130
Get him!

710
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,180
Louis!

711
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,140
Good friends...
