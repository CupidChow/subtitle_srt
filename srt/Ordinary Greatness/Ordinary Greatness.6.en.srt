6
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,660
Let go of me!

7
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,850
This is too much.

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,620
It's not over.

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,340
Let go!

Let go!

00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Xia Jie, what is it?

Stop recording! What does it have to do with you?

14
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,880
Are you busy?

15
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
Master, are you looking for me?

16
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,800
Come with me.

17
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,579
Are you tired of the police uniform?

18
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,100
No.

19
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,400
Master,

20
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,030
did I do well today?

21
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,060
Cut the crap！

22
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,790
You even put your hands on your hips?

23
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,550
Take off your hands.

24
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,890
You're in police uniform today,

25
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,780
pushing and shoving with the people on the street today.

26
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,760
You're on the city's trending topic, you know?

27
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,360
You're so big, Li Dawei.

28
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,260
Master, I can handle this.

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,440
Bullshit!

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,740
How did you handle it?

31
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,510
What happened exactly?

32
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,490
It's just a personal matter.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,930
When you're in police uniform, there's only official business.

34
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,650
Master,

35
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,180
you can't be so absolute.

36
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,540
You're so competent.

37
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,940
Fine, teach me how to say it.

38
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,860
We need to be reasonable.

39
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,370
OK. Be reasonable, right?

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,450
Fine, I'll reason with you.

41
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,610
In public,

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
I'm your master, right?

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,540
In private,

44
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,700
master and disciple are like father and son.

45
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
I am your father.

46
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,180
You have no reason to hide it from me both in public and private.

47
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,850
Right?

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,420
Didn't you ask for reasonableness?

49
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,960
Don't you understand such reason?

50
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,310
Didn't your mom teach you?

51
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,810
Didn't your dad teach you?

52
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,290
How dare you reason with me?

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,670
Say something.

54
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,710
Fine, master.

55
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,540
If you say so,

56
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,130
I won't say anything today.

57
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,900
You bastard!

58
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,780
Yes, I'm a jerk.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
My dad is a jerk too.

60
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,780
OK, Li Dawei.

61
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,900
I can't take care of you anymore.

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,100
You can find whoever you want.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,640
Li Dawei,

64
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,590
get up here!

65
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,340
Who is that?

66
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,410
What happened?

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,130
It has nothing to do with the police.

68
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,510
You're not in police uniform. It has nothing to do with the police.

69
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,790
You're in police uniform and on duty.

70
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,380
Could it be nothing to do with the police?

71
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,090
Look at the comments online.

72
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,590
What did they say?

73
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,810
Tell me, who is that person?

74
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,650
What happened?

75
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,340
I...

76
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,820
Chief, I...

77
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,780
What's going on?

78
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,730
The district bureau...

79
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,900
There's a call from the district bureau

80
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,980
to ask about the public opinion online.

81
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,850
Listen. Listen!

82
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,420
Do you think it's like the past?

83
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,320
You were so ostentatious.

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
Why did you do that?

85
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,360
What happened?

86
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,420
I said it has nothing to do with the police.

87
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Stop it.

88
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,780
You're such a stubborn donkey.

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,380
I'm so mad.

90
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,850
The district bureau has asked about it.

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,690
Can you still hide it?

92
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,940
Li Dawei,

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,490
don't take the chance.

94
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,010
Do you know where it is?

95
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,120
This is the public security bureau.

96
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,300
This is the police station.

97
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,790
There's nothing we can't find out.

98
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,050
I didn't take the chance.

99
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,320
Besides, I didn't break the law.

100
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,730
You didn't. But you broke the regulation.

101
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,050
Do you still want to wear this uniform?

102
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,940
Chief.

103
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,940
This is really a personal matter.

104
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,650
There are six types of violations.

105
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,440
Warning, demerit recording, major demerit recording,

106
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,140
demotion, dismissal and fire.

107
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
Which one do you want?

108
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,540
Go, go, go.

109
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,420
Go find a corner to reflect on yourself.

110
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,390
Stop standing here.

111
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,220
Get out!

112
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,460
There must be something.

113
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,530
Yes.

114
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,380
What's going on?

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,159
He's acting as a hero now.

116
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,909
He would rather die than say it out.

117
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,570
How can we explain to the district bureau?

118
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,790
Give it a rest.

119
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,050
Tell them the policeman was dealing with a private matter.

120
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,159
The police station is investigating too,

121
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,810
and have gave him harsh criticism and education.

122
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,910
The policeman also conducted in-depth self-examination.

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,980
Okay.

124
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,960
Wait.

125
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,980
Ask him to write a 3,000-word self-examination

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
to be prepared.

127
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,580
Spareribs with brown sauce.

128
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,730
No.

129
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,930
Big steamed stuffed bun.

130
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,659
It's still hot.

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
Eat it while it's hot.

132
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,530
I told you I'm not eating.

133
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,830
Who are you angry with?

134
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,650
Bro,

135
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,000
when I was in high school,

136
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,500
I brought my lunch and dinner from home.

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,010
I brought pancakes from home to school every week.

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,450
In hot weather,

139
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,290
before the weekend,

140
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,320
the pancake would be sour.

141
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,400
At that time, I saw the students in the city

142
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,840
who had vegetables and meat.

143
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,510
I was so hungry

144
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,990
and drooled every day.

145
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,679
I thought when I could eat vegetables

146
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
and meat every day.

147
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
I didn't expect it to come true so soon.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,610
It's like a dream.

149
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,710
Then you eat. I'm not hungry.

150
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,740
Who are you angry with?

151
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,440
Don't be angry with your stomach, buddy.

152
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,680
None of your business.

153
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,650
I'll leave it for you.

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,660
Almost here. This building.

155
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,450
Officer. Officer!

156
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,340
Did you call the police?

157
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
It's me.

158
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,300
- Come here to talk.
- Are you Ms. Ma?

159
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,330
Yes.

160
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,080
ID card?

161
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,780
Here.

162
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,460
What's going on?

163
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,300
Here's the thing.

164
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,420
Please help me.

165
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,170
I had a fight with my husband this afternoon.

166
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,900
We had a big fight.

167
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,050
He drove away.

168
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,700
But he hasn't come back yet.

169
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,820
I was afraid something would happen to him,

170
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,010
so I want you to help me find him.

171
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,610
What's his phone number?

172
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,040
His phone is off.

173
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,240
I suspect he went to our villa in the suburbs.

174
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,190
Can you two

175
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,810
to take a look at the villa?

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,450
Why don't you take a look yourself?

177
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,310
I have a kid here.

178
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,140
And villa is in the suburbs.

179
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,040
It's so dark.

180
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,310
I'm a little scared too.

181
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,770
OK.

182
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,520
Write down the address.

183
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,840
I've written down.

184
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,150
Here it is.

185
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,580
This is his phone number.

186
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,070
This is his plate number.

187
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,980
He drove an Audi A6.

188
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,580
Please take a look at the villa.

189
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,180
As long as the car is parked in the yard,

190
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,560
don't disturb him.

191
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,030
Just give me a call.

192
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,790
If he's really at home,

193
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,910
no, in the villa,

194
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,580
should we knock on the door and take a look?

195
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,420
No, no!

196
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,900
It's 11 o'clock now.

197
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,640
It'll be past twelve when you're there.

198
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,830
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,330
My husband has been suffering from insomnia recently.

200
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,650
If you wake him up,

201
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,480
he won't be able to sleep tonight.

202
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,920
So don't disturb him.

203
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,280
Just call me

204
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,810
if the car is in the yard of the villa.

205
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:28,970
How about this?

206
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,550
When we get there,

207
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,730
we'll call your husband.

208
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,330
- What if his phone is turned on?
- I told you not to call him.

209
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,530
I don't want you to disturb him.

210
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
I told you

211
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,590
as long as the car is parked in the yard of the villa,

212
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,570
it's okay.

213
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,640
Don't worry.

214
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,460
I got it. I got it.

215
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,670
Let's sort it out for Ms. Ma.

216
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,230
After we get there,

217
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,740
the only thing we should do is find the car.

218
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,660
We'll not call or knock.

219
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,360
We'll only call you.

220
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,030
Yes.

221
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,770
Is that what you mean?

222
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,770
Yes.

223
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,100
Do you remember it?

224
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,860
Yes.

225
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,690
Write it down and let Ms. Ma sign it.

226
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,530
Thank you.

227
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,200
Ms Ma, please sign here.

228
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,950
Okay.

229
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,340
Yang Shu, Li Dawei is in trouble.

230
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,280
The man we met on the street

231
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,440
is on the city's trending topic.

232
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,020
Where are you?

233
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,370
It should be the building ahead.

234
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,750
Let's take a look.

235
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,960
Why isn't the light on?

236
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,370
Is it here?

237
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,940
I don't think anyone lives here.

238
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,510
Yes.

239
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,130
The car has been parked in the yard.

240
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,690
Turn on the lights and check the license plate.

241
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,490
Is it?

242
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,880
Ping E58080.

243
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:49,890
That's right.

244
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,930
I'll answer the phone.

245
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,890
You go and take a look.

246
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,190
Don't forget to call Ms. Ma.

247
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,140
Hello?

248
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,460
I'm working.

249
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,360
The car is inside.

250
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,980
The lights of the villa are not on.

251
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,530
Hello.

252
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:42,980
Ms. Ma.

253
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,620
This is the policeman who responded your call from Balihe Police Station.

254
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,540
We're at the villa you mentioned.

255
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,820
Your husband's car is parked in the yard.

256
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,240
Shouldn't we go in

257
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,020
or call him?

258
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,120
His car is in the yard?

259
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,670
Did you confirm it was his car?

260
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,970
Yes, Ping E58080.

261
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,910
That's good.

262
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
No, don't call him.

263
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,750
Don't disturb him.

264
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,650
Thank you.

265
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,850
Then let me check again.

266
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,760
As long as we see the car parked in the yard,

267
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,990
it's okay.

268
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,120
We don't have to go in

269
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,620
or call him, right?

270
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,420
Yes.

271
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,140
OK. Bye.

272
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,890
Yang Shu, Li Dawei is in trouble.

273
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,410
The man we met on the street

274
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,450
is on the city's trending topic.

275
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,410
Yang Shu, where are you?

276
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
The station is going to punish Li Dawei.

277
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,170
Maybe he'll resign.

278
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,310
Li Dawei was so stubborn.

279
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,610
He didn't tell us who the man was.

280
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,730
Finished?

281
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,700
Yes.

282
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,980
What did she say?

283
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,720
She told us not to disturb her husband.

284
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,340
Since she cares about her husband so much,

285
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,380
why were they arguing at night?

286
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,140
Master,

287
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,980
could you please drive?

288
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,330
I'll check the information.

289
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,740
What information?

290
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,820
Just...

291
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,700
Go.

292
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,200
Thank you, master.

293
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,020
Are you

294
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,520
going on a hunger strike?

295
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,590
I can't eat.

296
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,940
If you can't,

297
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,520
you won't have the energy to write a self-examination.

298
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,380
I heard Chief asked for at least 3,000 words.

299
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,180
Let alone 3,000 words,

300
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,260
I can't write a single word.

301
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,310
If you can't,

302
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,730
I can help you write.

303
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,740
What do you know

304
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,940
before you want to hep me?

305
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,100
Don't mention it.

306
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,290
When I applied to be a civil servant,

307
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,040
my first choice was not to be a cop,

308
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,420
but to enter the government.

309
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,700
So I have practiced well

310
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,060
about how to write the official document,

311
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,460
including how to write a self-examination.

312
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,380
I'll write it for you.

313
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,860
I promise I'll make

314
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,030
the 3,000 words be profound and touching,

315
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,620
and touch the soul.

316
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,530
OK.

317
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,900
Let's try.

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,570
Bro, I owe you.

319
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,560
How about I read it and you write it?

320
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,040
It's more inspiring.

321
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,300
Okay.

322
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Dear leader.

323
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,550
Why don't you take a bite first?

324
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,089
No, no. I'll finish it before eating.

325
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,619
I was not very mentally prepared and

326
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,970
didn't have enough political awareness today.

327
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,450
I forgot

328
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,869
the responsibility and obligation of a police officer.

329
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,260
I had a conflict with the people on the street

330
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,820
and caused a terrible impact.

331
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,960
Therefore,

332
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,720
I was deeply regretful.

333
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,190
I've let the organization down

334
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,980
who has cultivated and educated me for years.

335
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,220
I've let my leaders down

336
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,540
who has been valuing me.

337
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,900
After that,

338
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,560
I felt very sad.

339
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,690
I felt

340
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,670
I was guilty.

341
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,030
I felt sorry fot the honor of a police officer.

342
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,180
What are you talking about?

343
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,980
You're so good at this.

344
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,620
Stop nagging.

345
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,770
I'm getting inspired again.

346
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,750
Recently,

347
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,860
I often remember

348
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,720
a familiar sentence.

349
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,060
People's police

350
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,540
love the people.

351
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,580
Exclamation mark! Exclamation mark! Exclamation mark!

352
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,900
One more.

353
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,740
Begin on a new line.

354
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,660
Dear  Chief Wang Shouyi,

355
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,660
Officer Chen.

356
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,490
Xia Jie.

357
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Why didn't you reply my WeChat?

358
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,620
I know whom Li Dawei pushed.

359
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,780
How do you know?

360
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,300
PDA.

361
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,730
How would PDA know?

362
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,060
Hold on.

363
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,650
I'll check it on the Intranet.

364
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,660
It's him.

365
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,120
[Information on Household]

366
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,730
Li Dawei's father?

367
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,660
That's impossible.

368
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,580
Why not? It is him.

369
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
But why Li Dawei pushed his dad

370
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,980
so fiercely?

371
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,250
We saw it.

372
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,540
So what?

373
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,580
Why did he do that?

374
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,380
There must be a reason.

375
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,340
Fine.

376
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,140
Anyway, I admire you.

377
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,080
What are you talking about?

378
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,660
Are you talking about Li Dawei?

379
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,420
Yang Shu just found out the person

380
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,690
Li Dawei pushed is his father.

381
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,850
Isn't it wrong?

382
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,180
We've verified all.

383
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,140
Li Dawei.

384
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,930
I went out for a case with my master.

385
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,960
Xia Jie sent me a message but I didn't see it.

386
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,660
After the case was finished, I knew something happened to Li Dawei.

387
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,340
So I read relevant posts online

388
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,580
and reviewed the comments first.

389
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,340
I saw there was someone arguing with those trolls online.

390
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,350
Judging from the content of the chat,

391
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,690
they should be Li Dawei's friends or classmates.

392
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,660
They said

393
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,580
don't slander the police.

394
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,940
You don't know the truth.

395
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,820
Don't talk nonsense.

396
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,420
That man is Li Dawei's father, Li Yisheng.

397
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,780
That's his personal matter.

398
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,260
It'll be more convenient with this clue.

399
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,660
Since there was only PDA around,

400
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,290
I'm not sure about that.

401
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,100
But I'm sure now.

402
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,540
Is it him?

403
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,030
Yang Shu and I were at the scene when that happened.

404
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,670
That's right.

405
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,150
Let's talk to Chief.

406
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,940
You finished the examination

407
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,420
in such a short time.

408
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,860
It's quite profound.

409
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,530
Just now,

410
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,230
The inspector from the bureau came to ask about the progress again.

411
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,190
Chief just called.

412
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,910
He meant

413
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,130
Li Dawei was not an important person anyway.

414
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,200
And something serious happened during his internship.

415
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,540
He fought with the people.

416
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,300
If it's really his fault,

417
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,540
our station doesn't want him.

418
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,980
He should resign.

419
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,810
What?

420
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,260
So ... so serious?

421
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,490
Troublemaker.

422
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,500
Come in.

423
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,900
Chief.

424
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,940
What's going on?

425
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,570
Master.

426
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,810
Chief Cheng.

427
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,220
You all didn't leave.

428
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Chief, we've figured it out.

429
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
The man Li Dawei pushed is his father.

430
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,820
He ... he is really a troublemaker.

431
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,580
What?

432
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,860
It's his father?

433
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,780
Yang, tell Chief about it.

434
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,300
Chief, I just checked

435
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
through the Intranet.

436
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,660
Xia Jie and I can also prove

437
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,020
that person is Li Dawei's father.

438
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,250
3,666 words.

439
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,220
Good.

440
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,700
It's so good.

441
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,220
You've worked so hard today.

442
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,420
I'll go out

443
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,090
and watch the surveillance for you.

444
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,130
You mean

445
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,720
the case of losing disposable diaper?

446
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,610
No need. The case is solved.

447
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,500
Solved?

448
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,260
Which pervert stole it?

449
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,780
There are not so many perverts in the world.

450
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,250
According to my master,

451
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,620
we are all ordinary people.

452
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,220
Since we are ordinary,

453
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,060
we have common people's desires and demands.

454
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,100
If you have desires and demands,

455
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,580
you will naturally make mistakes.

456
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,460
Don't keep me guessing.

457
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,260
Who stole it?

458
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,900
A five-or-six-year-old boy.

459
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,150
A five-or-six-year-old boy?

460
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,900
Why did he steal the disposable diaper?

461
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,100
For his sister who is five or six months.

462
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,060
Where are their parents?

463
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,580
His parents

464
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,670
work in another city.

465
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,340
His dad hardly comes back at the construction site.

466
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,660
His mother sets up a moving fast food truck

467
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,580
and sells fried rice, fried noodles, pancakes, cold noodles and so on.

468
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,150
She goes out early in the morning

469
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,250
and comes back late at night.

470
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,060
So the boy

471
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,500
has to take care of his sister.

472
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,410
But her brother was still a kid.

473
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,580
He didn't know how to teach his sister to urinate or defecate.

474
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,340
When he went out to see other kids

475
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,860
with the disposable diaper.

476
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,260
He realized they didn't have one.

477
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,170
So he often went to the express station

478
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,560
to steal one or two

479
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,100
for his sister.

480
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,460
When we first checked the surveillance recording,

481
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,900
we didn't notice this little boy at all.

482
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,380
I've checked the recording many times,

483
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,660
but I couldn't find any clues.

484
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,340
Until one day, I...

485
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,340
Are you listening?

486
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,580
I won't keep saying if you aren't.

487
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,580
Go on.

488
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,940
Did you find this clue?

489
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,340
I wish.

490
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,050
Your master found that?

491
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,200
Yes.

492
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,150
Why are there so many people

493
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,770
who can't take the responsibility

494
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,030
but insist on being the parents?

495
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,740
Chief, look.

496
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,580
It's clear now.

497
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,500
Li Dawei is still downstairs.

498
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,420
Why don't we let him go back first?

499
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,500
It's getting late.

500
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,460
When did you start to

501
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,040
care about him?

502
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,740
Don't you dislike him?

503
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,460
No.

504
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,220
I just want him to go back

505
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,210
and apologize to his father, right?

506
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,010
Look.

507
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,810
The public opinion has been already spread in this state.

508
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,910
We can't simply explain that the person is his father.

509
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,660
If we don't figure out

510
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,340
the whole story,

511
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,850
how can we explain it?

512
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,220
Then what should we do?

513
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,300
What should we do?

514
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,460
Let me tell you, this is serious.

515
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,930
Director has called.

516
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,700
He said if the matter can't be handled well, tell Li Dawei to resign.

517
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,350
Resign?

518
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,290
Is this necessary?

519
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,460
It's not a big deal.

520
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,900
It's not a big deal.

521
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,140
It's not like that.

522
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,220
What do you mean, Chief?

523
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,700
When Li Dawei came,

524
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,490
didn't I say I don't want this man?

525
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,980
Who forced me to accept him?

526
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,250
I told you he liked to show off and was annoying.

527
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,830
He likes showing off and is unreliable.

528
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,620
I don't like him.

529
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,860
As his master,

530
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,660
I think I'm very unlucky.

531
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,980
But shouldn't we judge people by nature?

532
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,020
He is a good kid in nature.

533
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,050
There must be a reason for this.

534
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,580
How can I not know that?

535
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,750
Yes.

536
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,330
You're the leader. Of course you know.

537
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,380
But, but why exactly?

538
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,090
Maybe he won't tell us for the rest of his life.

539
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,700
Everyone has secrets.

540
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,500
It doesn't matter as long as it doesn't harm others.

541
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,500
It doesn't matter as long as it doesn't harm others?

542
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,300
Things have become so serious.

543
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,500
It's not the matter in the station,

544
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,420
- but the whole public security bureau.
- Chief. Chief.

545
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,410
- It relates to the image of the police officer.
- Chief, do you know...

546
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,180
Xincheng, Xincheng.

547
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,020
Stop arguing.

548
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,140
I think we are all exhausted.

549
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,220
- That's right.
- It's too late.

550
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,450
Let's go back. Let's go.

551
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,390
Go back.

552
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:13,940
Bye.

553
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,300
Chief will find a way.

554
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,700
Give him some time.

555
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,300
Go back.

556
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,690
Let's go back and rest.

557
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,900
Come on, go back and have a rest.

558
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,500
Come on, Xia Jie.

559
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,330
Go back now.

560
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,350
Chief.

561
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,020
Are you really angry?

562
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,970
No.

563
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,740
I'm thinking how to solve this.

564
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,340
All right, you should go back too.

565
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,980
Then please think about it.

566
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,460
You still know how to come back?

567
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,450
Mom, why didn't you turn on the lights?

568
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,410
You scared me.

569
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,650
I scared you?

570
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,260
It is you who scared me.

571
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,380
Why are you crying again?

572
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,810
Why didn't you call me

573
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,420
if don't come back.

574
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,380
You didn't answer my call.

575
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
Cheng Hao didn't answer my call.

576
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,820
Wang Shouyi didn't answer my call.

577
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,300
If you come back half an hour later,

578
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,980
I'll call the police.

579
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,280
Can you stop

580
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,940
calling them all the time?

581
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,540
Why can't I?

582
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,710
They promised

583
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,170
to take good care of you.

584
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,660
They have taken good care of me.

585
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,100
It's so good that

586
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,520
I think I'm not going to be a police officer.

587
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,210
Instead, I'm going to cause trouble.

588
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,260
What are you talking about?

589
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,340
You said you want to be a police officer.

590
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,860
Fine, I agree with your dream.

591
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,650
But since you have become a police officer,

592
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,050
can you stop me from worrying about you?

593
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,560
Fine, I can't go to Qingdao anymore.

594
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,980
Mom, how can you do this?

595
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,170
I've booked the house

596
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,340
and the ticket.

597
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,580
I've contacted my aunt.

598
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,180
I said I won't go.

599
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,570
Xia!

600
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,380
Don't stop me!

601
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,620
Xia.

602
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,540
Mom, I'm back.

603
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,340
Why are you here?

604
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,260
I told you not to come back.

605
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,010
What are you talking about? This is my home.

606
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,960
How can I not come back?

607
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,330
Where's my mom?

608
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,370
She went grocery shopping. She'll be back soon.

609
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,370
You have your own legs.

610
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,670
Get out by yourself. Don't let me push you.

611
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,320
Your mom will be back soon after buying groceries.

612
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,220
- The three of us can have a good meal.
- Stop talking nonsense!

613
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,900
There are only two people in my family.

614
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,860
My mom and I.

615
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,140
We were like this when I was a kid.

616
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,020
It's the same now.

617
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,300
Get out!

618
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,940
No.

619
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:00,940
Listen to me.

620
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,880
I came back this time

621
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,100
to live a good life with your mother.

622
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,140
How many times have you said that?

623
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,620
Do you think I'll believe you?

624
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,790
I won't run around this time.

625
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,770
I won't mess around anymore.

626
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,450
Live a good life, right?

627
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,100
How dare you say that?

628
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,160
How many days have you stayed at home?

629
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,850
Have you ever taken the responsibility

630
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,060
as a father and a husband?

631
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,570
My mom worked hard to make money and raise me.

632
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,420
How about you?

633
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,700
Every time you showed, you lied to my mom.

634
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,050
Every time you showed, you lied to my mom.

635
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,130
My mom is in her sixties.

636
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,060
She still does the earthwork.

637
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,300
Count how many people in the world will do that like her?

638
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,690
Live a good life?

639
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,110
You borrowed money from my mom and said you'd double return her.

640
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,020
Did you pay back? Where is the money?

641
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,060
I won't borrow money from your mom this time.

642
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,060
Really. I'm coming back to live a good life.

643
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,260
Cut the crap.

644
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,460
Come here. Give it to me.

645
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,660
Put it down.

646
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,340
It's our stool!

647
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,780
Let me tell you.

648
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,760
My mom has officially filed

649
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,500
a divorce lawsuit in court.

650
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,260
You know what?

651
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,970
You didn't get the summons, right?

652
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,460
We made it public in the newspaper.

653
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,220
Did you see that?

654
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,220
I was abroad.

655
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,580
How can I see it?

656
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,740
Okay, since you're back,

657
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,090
I'm officially informing you.

658
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,060
You just find a place to stay

659
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,500
and wait for the trial.

660
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,300
You can go wherever you want after the divorce.

661
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,140
It's none of my business.

662
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,700
No.

663
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,260
Dawei.

664
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,250
I'm old. I won't run around anymore.

665
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,260
Trust me.

666
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Do you know how much trouble you caused me when you came back?

667
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,980
I'm back.

668
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,900
Why is the door open?

669
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,560
Let me help you.

670
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,640
You...

671
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,780
I thought you were on duty.

672
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,150
I didn't expect you to come home.

673
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,690
Luckily, I'm back.

674
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,860
Why are you confused again?

675
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,240
Aren't you luring a wolf into the house?

676
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,060
What do you mean?

677
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,740
If your dad is a wolf, then who are you?

678
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,380
Don't say that about your dad.

679
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,820
Besides, he has changed.

680
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,330
He said he won't go out anymore.

681
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,060
Oh my god.

682
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,460
How many times do you have to be cheated by him

683
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,060
to figure it out?

684
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,180
He always said that when he came back.

685
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,220
How many days did it take for you

686
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,420
to pay the debt by him last time?

687
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,540
How long did it take for you to pay it back?

688
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,740
Well,

689
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,780
your dad...

690
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,300
He's not lying.

691
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,420
He is...

692
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,980
He has a lot of ideas.

693
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,050
Gosh! Many ideas.

694
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,420
Which idea made him be rich?

695
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,690
Yes, it's not easy to make money now.

696
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,590
So he...

697
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,420
Why are you still defending him?

698
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,380
Didn't we agree

699
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,180
to file a divorce lawsuit with him?

700
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,130
Are you softhearted?

701
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,550
Your dad is not what you think.

702
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,420
Mom, stop lying to yourself.

703
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,420
Let me tell you.

704
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,380
Do you know how much trouble

705
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,540
he caused me when he came back?

706
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,460
I wrote a self-examination in the station today.

707
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,620
I almost

708
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,700
had to resign because of him.

709
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,380
Son, what happened?

710
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,090
- What happened?
- Nothing.

711
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,980
Mom, don't worry.

712
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
I can handle it.

713
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,739
That's not the point.

714
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,100
The point is we have to let him go right now.

715
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,060
Son, come back.

716
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,050
You...

717
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,739
Li Dawei, your mom is old now,

718
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,020
and your dad is old.

719
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,100
I

720
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,449
know your dad very well.

721
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,940
He will always be

722
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,620
like a child who hasn't grown up.

723
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,739
But now,

724
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,429
he won't cause any more trouble, right?

725
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,449
We can live together now.

726
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,620
Mom.

727
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,900
You have me.

728
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,980
You don't need to live with him.

729
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,820
I've grown up.

730
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,420
I can return the rental house.

731
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,380
I'm not going anywhere.

732
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,620
I'll be with you every day.

733
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,460
Son.

734
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,860
Yes, you've grown up.

735
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,960
You've grown up and become a police officer.

736
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,700
You'll be busier and busier

737
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,450
in the future.

738
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,740
The point is you will have your own girlfriend

739
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,660
and your own family.

740
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,810
So,

741
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,810
I won't interfere in your business.

742
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,660
Don't get involved in my business, okay?

743
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,450
Yes.

744
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,060
Your mom and I are old.

745
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,340
Don't tear us apart.

746
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,240
Tear you apart?

747
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,020
Mom, is that what you want?

748
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,500
I checked

749
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,340
the rental house. It's good.

750
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,580
I've cleaned it for you.

751
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,960
You can move in these days.

752
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,450
Are you chasing me away?

753
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,780
- Didn't you say that?
- No.

754
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,780
I seldom spend time with your mother?

755
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,980
Now

756
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,380
I'll have a good time with your mom.

757
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,540
Enough!

758
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,540
You two can do whatever you want.

759
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,960
I shouldn't be nosy.

760
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,140
Moving out?

761
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,230
Okay, I'll move.

762
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,740
I'll move out now.

763
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,410
Why are you here?

764
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,130
Didn't you invite us to rent with you yesterday?

765
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,420
No.

766
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,460
I'm going to live alone.

767
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,860
Li Dawei, can you grow up?

768
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,170
Don't always think of yourself as a child.

769
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,420
This statement...

770
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,820
Do you think you're the class monitor?

771
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,590
What are you looking at?

772
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
We all know

773
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,700
the person you pushed yesterday is your dad.

774
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,300
How did you know?

775
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,820
Last night,

776
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,860
Chief, Chief Cheng, instructor,

777
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,820
and your master are worried about you.

778
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,750
Your master had a fight with Chief.

779
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,840
Everyone is protecting you.

780
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,270
No way. He hates me so much.

781
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,160
I don't want to talk too much.

782
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,360
Take your time to understand it.

783
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,180
Which room do I live in?

784
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,050
You choose first.

785
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,220
It doesn't matter where I live anyway.

786
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,100
Then this room.

787
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,460
Don't you have a home?

788
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,700
Why do you rent a house?

789
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,640
Actually,

790
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,190
you don't have to tell me anything.

791
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,060
You should

792
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,490
tell Chief everything.

793
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,220
Otherwise, he can't protect you even if he wants to.

794
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,050
I can't even see your curve of lumbar vertebra.

795
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,530
All right, get up.

796
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
Nothing serious.

797
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,780
It's just like that the machine is old and overused.

798
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,240
You have to listen to me.

799
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,380
Your body is yours.

800
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,700
And there's always work.

801
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,050
Come to our physical therapy department for therapy every day.

802
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,500
Take care of your waist.

803
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,440
The rest of your life is still long.

804
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,140
You...

805
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,440
It is easy for you to say that.

806
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,860
Do physical therapy every day?

807
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,980
You might as well let me pretend to be sick.

808
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,940
How to say that sentence?

809
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,570
Take an unduly long rest for a slight illness, right?

810
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:17,690
You...

811
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,340
Think about it. I don't have the time, right?

812
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,690
You know

813
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,010
we are quite busy.

814
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,860
And recently,

815
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,300
new young people have come.

816
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,530
I'm worried.

817
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,660
You always have a reason.

818
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,580
When you were young,

819
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,160
you're worried about your work.

820
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,620
Now that you're old,

821
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,820
you're worried about the young.

822
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,260
Forget it. I won't persuade you.

823
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,170
You're old and I'm old.

824
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,530
I know you won't change in the rest of your life.

825
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,420
Nothing will change.

826
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,600
Your medicine doesn't work.

827
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,460
Why don't you come to my house when you're free?

828
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,420
Although I'm not a massage doctor,

829
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,020
prolonged illness makes a doctor of a patient.

830
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,500
My massage skill is good.

831
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,610
I don't help others do that.

832
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,700
But for the sake of

833
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,920
our years of friendship,

834
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,810
I'll do massage for you.

835
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,960
Come on.

836
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,140
You are so busy with work every day.

837
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,900
Should I go to your house?

838
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,780
Listen.

839
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,500
I won't make my sister-in-law dislike me anymore.

840
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,380
Come in.

841
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,060
Doctor, the report is out.

842
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,100
Please check it for me.

843
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,890
I'm leaving.

844
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,660
How are you doing?

845
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,980
Not bad.

846
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,700
Cao, you're back.

847
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,870
Cao.

848
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,890
A woman came just now.

849
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,160
She said she called the police,

850
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,220
but the police didn't do anything.

851
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,150
Now her husband committed suicide.

852
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,840
Yang Shu was asked just now.

853
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,200
It has nothing to do with you, right?

854
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,660
Chief, that is...

855
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,300
It's done by Yang Shu.

856
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,350
I just wanted to train him.

857
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,700
What happened?

858
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,620
She found her husband committed suicide

859
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,010
in the car early this morning.

860
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,860
Well, Yang Shu,

861
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,940
I just took a phone call then.

862
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,100
Why didn't you go to the car to take a look?

863
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,820
But master...

864
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,110
Master, what do you mean?

865
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,310
Weren't we together at that time?

866
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:47,940
- Then...
- Yes, there's a yard in their villa.

867
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,490
Yes, there's a yard in their villa.

868
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,480
The gate of the yard was locked.

869
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,780
Since she didn't allow us to knock,

870
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,740
we couldn't vault it over, right?

871
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,740
We couldn't get in.
