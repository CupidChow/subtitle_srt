00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,100
I got an old man, a child

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,070
and a woman.

7
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,710
The same with you.

8
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,180
I also got an old man, a child,

9
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,380
a woman and her husband.

10
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,820
You win. The situation is more complicated than mine.

11
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,850
Don't stop me.

12
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,570
Honey!

13
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,539
-Don't stop me. -Honey.

14
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,180
Don't stop me!

15
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,759
I'm going to get even with that old man.

16
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,490
Don't stop me.

17
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,289
Is there no law here?

18
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,020
Sir, calm down.

19
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,770
He is a rascal.

20
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,690
What's the use of looking for him?

21
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,850
Who else can I look for?

22
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,280
Calm down.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,259
Calm down.

24
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,539
OK, officer.

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,460
You are the police.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,620
Please help me!

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,360
That old man

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,950
He scared my child.

29
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,730
What should we do about it?

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,580
Do you police still care about it?

31
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,220
Do you care?

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,340
Listen to me first.

33
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,820
Please calm down and listen to me.

34
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,100
The old man who had a fight

35
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,770
with your wife

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,070
is in the hospital too.

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,750
What?

38
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,800
He hit my wife and kid.

39
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,450
He even pretended to be the victim and went to the hospital.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,050
Where is he?

41
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,740
Sir, calm down.

42
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,920
Don't be impulsive.

43
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,470
The child is still lying in the hospital, right?

44
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,690
Let's go check on the child first, OK?

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,700
Ms. Zhou, please help me persuade him.

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,760
I just want to reason with him.

47
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,660
-This is the hospital.  -Yes.

48
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,940
-What are you doing? -Don't affect others.

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,660
For the sake of the child,

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,530
I have to talk to him.

51
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,340
-Right. Right. -Right?

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,350
Should I talk to him?

53
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,960
Yes.

54
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,540
Yes.

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,380
How could he do that?

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,630
OK, we'll talk later.

57
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,850
Ms. Zhou, please talk to him.

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,190
Li Dawei,

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,540
You should...

60
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,570
You go and check

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,350
what's going on with the old man.

62
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,220
Contact his family as soon as possible.

63
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,050
-Ok. -Go.

64
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,310
Master, have some water.

65
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,540
OK. Go now.

66
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,079
Yang Shu, we're even now.

67
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,290
What does he mean?

68
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,080
I don't know what he said.

69
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,290
Water.

70
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,730
Dawei bought it.

71
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,750
Excuse me.

72
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,660
What happened to him?

73
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,930
He was fine just now. Why did he lie down?

74
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,170
The patient fell asleep.

75
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,060
How is he?

76
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,730
We won't know until we do further examination.

77
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,220
But the patient can't be stimulated.

78
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,060
Listen to me.

79
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,170
He can't walk now.

80
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:24,850
He's not sick.

81
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,780
He's really not sick.

82
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,410
Officer,

83
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,170
please come here.

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,710
If he's not sick,

85
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,570
how can he be lying in bed.

86
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,820
Don't disturb other patients.

87
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,450
Be quiet.

88
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,130
Don't go any further.

89
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,380
Did you receive any benefits from them?

90
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,750
You still take their side?

91
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,450
Yes.

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
What are you talking about?

93
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,310
The doctors have never seen that family.

94
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,410
How could they be biased?

95
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,410
What are you doing?

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,450
Besides,

97
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,750
why don't you take care of the elderly?

98
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,100
Why are you arguing with the doctors?

99
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,100
What is the point of taking care of him?

100
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,340
He's already unconscious.

101
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,930
Behave yourself.

102
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,880
We have no other request.

103
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,060
Where are they?

104
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,290
You are only responsible for calling them out.

105
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,380
They should pay the bill.

106
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,300
They should pay for us, right?

107
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,350
Yes, that's right.

108
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,220
OK. OK.

109
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,000
Listen to me.

110
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,450
In this case,

111
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,060
your old man was indeed wrong.

112
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,890
We all saw that.

113
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,980
That he suddenly fell to the ground has nothing to do with the other side.

114
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,050
What do you mean by saying it has nothing to do with them?

115
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,610
Right.

116
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,610
I think you guys must have conspired with them

117
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,850
and hit him down like this.

118
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,730
You guys must have conspired with them

119
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,540
and irritated the old man.

120
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,290
Ms.,

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,530
we have video records

122
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,900
in the whole process.

123
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,780
We're also recording it now.

124
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,170
It can be proved that

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,830
your old man did faint by himself.

126
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,430
And he didn't have a dog license.

127
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,540
He didn't leash the dog.

128
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,930
He broke the law first.

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,930
Who are you?

130
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,100
How dare you cut in

131
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,360
while we are talking?

132
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
Go away.

133
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:42,460
-Can you watch your mouth? -He is on purpose.

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,780
Be quiet!

135
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,780
-Shut up. -Be quiet.

136
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,540
What bullshit are you talking about?

137
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,250
Stop yelling.

138
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,220
This is a hospital, you know?

139
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,360
Your old man is not sick at all.

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,210
If you keep arguing here,

141
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,090
you will make the situation worse.

142
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,940
This will be identified as violence against doctors.

143
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm warning you.

144
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,850
If you keep messing around, I'll take forced measures.

145
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,810
What are you looking at?

146
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,780
Security.

147
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,320
Clear the place.

148
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,860
Don't touch me.

149
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,020
Let's see who dares to stay.

150
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,980
Don't touch me.

151
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,360
Let's go, bro.

152
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,020
It's OK now, everybody.

153
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,620
It's OK now. Sorry to disturb you.

154
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,700
Don't touch me. Don't move.

155
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,040
I went out to buy some vegetables

156
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,450
but I didn't take the key.

157
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,520
If I remember correctly,

158
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,870
your home should be on the 18th floor.

159
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,580
Yes.

160
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,930
Look at the top floor.

161
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,050
The one next to the deck.

162
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,100
That one.

163
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,159
Officer Zhang, you have a good memory.

164
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,100
Please take a cigarette.

165
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,850
No, thanks.

166
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,480
Officer Zhang, you told me last time

167
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,800
to install a security door.

168
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,220
But it was too safe.

169
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,000
It can't be opened without the key.

170
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,630
Where is your wife?

171
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,659
She didn't take her key either?

172
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,990
My wife is on a business trip.

173
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,040
She'll be back in a few days.

174
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,380
I can't sleep in the corridor these days, right?

175
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,240
You mean...

176
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,920
Officer Zhang,

177
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,510
take out the key for me.

178
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Take it out?

179
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,610
How do we take it out?

180
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,810
Look.

181
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,270
The deck next door is not closed.

182
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,140
You can just step over the wall

183
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,150
and go into my home, right?

184
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,060
I didn't close the window.

185
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,130
Have you watched too many American movies?

186
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,700
Do you think we police

187
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,020
are all like Spiderman?

188
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,820
Officer Cheung,

189
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Who is this young comrade?

190
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,140
What are you talking about?

191
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,370
-We taxpayers pay the money. -Enough. Enough.

192
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,730
We just want you to serve the people.

193
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,580
Calm down.

194
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,950
He is Zhao, a new officer in our station.

195
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,670
How could he talk like that?

196
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,650
He was just kidding.

197
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,760
No, Officer Zhang.

198
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,700
Just tell me

199
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,810
will you help me or not?

200
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,570
It is really dangerous

201
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,640
to climb onto he 18th floor.

202
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,290
If we go up

203
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,350
and fall off,

204
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,200
you will remember this scene

205
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,220
for the rest of your life, right?

206
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,590
How about this?

207
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,200
You can hire a locksmith.

208
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,360
It will cost only one or two hundred yuan.

209
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,320
You think it is a small number?

210
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,290
It's not easy to make money now.

211
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,050
How about this?

212
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,570
I'll pay for you, OK?

213
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,790
I don't think it's appropriate.

214
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,810
Sure it's appropriate.

215
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,430
I'll spend 200 yuan

216
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,220
to buy our lives.

217
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,480
That's perfect.

218
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,600
Stop hesitating and call a locksmith.

219
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,710
I'll call then.

220
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,920
Li Dawei,

221
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,280
Didn't I ask you to contact his family?

222
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,620
Why are you playing with your phone?

223
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,480
Master.

224
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,570
Can you stop being so prejudiced against me?

225
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,830
Do I need prejudice?

226
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,990
Master, here's the thing.

227
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,030
The old man

228
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,110
didn't bring his ID.

229
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,430
We only know a name,

230
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,330
Wang Jianguo.

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,730
So what?

232
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,170
Do you know how many people

233
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,460
named Wang Jianguo are there registered in our system across the country?

234
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,530
Don't you know how to screen a list?

235
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,530
Do you know

236
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,820
how many people over 70 named Wang Jianguo

237
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,620
are there?

238
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,700
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

239
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,330
Get to the point.

240
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,770
Alright, get to the point.

241
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,800
After my calculation and screening,

242
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,880
I’ve locked 16 police stations.

243
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,810
I respectively sent them

244
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,390
a photo of Wang Jianguo.

245
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,030
Tunhe Zhuang Police Station just called back.

246
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,560
Go on.

247
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,470
They said he looked similar.

248
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,450
But they couldn't confirm it.

249
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,120
On the one hand,

250
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,590
the registered photo of him is too small.

251
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,440
On the other hand,

252
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,910
this Wang Jianguo's eyes are closed

253
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,130
in the photo.

254
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,419
Can't you take a picture with his eyes open?

255
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,510
I have to open his eyes first.

256
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,929
He's not awake yet?

257
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,559
Master! Master!

258
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,680
Say it.

259
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
The station said

260
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,830
the photo of this Wang Jianguo

261
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,410
doesn't match the one over there.

262
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,750
That Wang Jianguo over there

263
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,710
was abandoned by his family and no one cared about him.

264
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,530
The police station has been mediated several times.

265
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,950
That old man is living alone.

266
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,690
Master, you win.

267
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,640
The doctor said he has liver hardening at a terminal stage.

268
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,710
He was lively when he was cursing.

269
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,840
Sir, you're finally awake.

270
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,080
Don't let her run away.

271
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,040
I need her to pay for my treatment.

272
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,200
Sir.,

273
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,230
your illness has nothing to do

274
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,360
with Ms. Zhou.

275
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,550
Why?

276
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,360
She hit me and I got this illness.

277
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,920
The doctor said

278
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
you have had cirrhosis

279
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
for several years.

280
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,110
Mrs. Zhou scratched your face

281
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,160
instead of your liver.

282
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,800
Dawei.

283
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,940
I don't care.

284
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,720
If she hadn't hit me,

285
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,460
I wouldn't have ended up here.

286
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,080
Sir, calm down.

287
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,990
It's bad for your health.

288
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,020
We're here

289
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,010
to ask you

290
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
how to contact your family.

291
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,960
I don't have any family.

292
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,400
Mr. Wang,

293
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,050
you live in Tunhe Village, right?

294
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,450
According to your household register,

295
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,560
you have a wife

296
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,720
and a son.

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,930
What did I do in my previous life?

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,890
I am terminally ill when I am old.

299
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,410
I was driven out by them.

300
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,440
Why are people like this nowadays?

301
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,040
I deserve it.

302
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,970
I really deserve it.

303
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,360
Don't think that I'm willing to scam people.

304
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,980
I really have no choice.

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,480
I have no choice.

306
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,200
What's the point of living like me?

307
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,310
I'd rather die.

308
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,910
Sir.

309
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,040
It's not necessary.

310
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,210
Sir.

311
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,710
Calm down.

312
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,090
Come on.

313
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,840
That old man broke the law.

314
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,520
And he was obviously pretending to be sick.

315
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,400
How could we just let him go?

316
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,440
I think it makes no sense.

317
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,040
I knew you would say that.

318
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,930
This old man is old.

319
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,930
He pretended to be sick this time.

320
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
What if he is really sick next time?

321
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,280
What should we do?

322
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,170
Look at Li Dawei.

323
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,710
I don't know how long it will take them to stay in the hospital.

324
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,740
How many cases can we solve if they have that time?

325
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,400
But if we just let him be like this,

326
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,210
will people like him

327
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,590
be more rampant

328
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,090
and more disrespectful for the laws?

329
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,450
Shu,

330
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,150
reality is reality.

331
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,780
Theory is theory.

332
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,380
Our reality is to solve the problem.

333
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,320
It's not about who's right or wrong.

334
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,410
We only need to ease the conflict

335
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,660
and calm things down.

336
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,210
That's true.

337
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,540
But we are police.

338
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,650
We are law enforcement personnel.

339
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,170
Right and wrong.

340
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,640
If we don't know, who will know?

341
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,960
If we don't correct it, who will?

342
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,240
It shouldn't be ignored

343
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,160
with a word of reality.

344
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,390
If we hadn't ignored them

345
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,200
and kept trying to reason with them,

346
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,330
would they have left?

347
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,720
If it continues, will there be any peace in the hospital

348
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,030
and will the patients get treated as usual?

349
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,880
You need to know

350
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,760
what is more important?

351
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,410
Am I right, Ding?

352
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,130
Master.

353
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,140
Shouldn't we focus on

354
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,150
the guy with a scare on his face we saw at Datun Village?

355
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,030
Jiwei,

356
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,150
shouldn't you find a place to stay?

357
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,700
It's not good

358
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,610
to in the station.

359
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,230
I have a place to stay, Master.

360
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,020
I have a relative in the city.

361
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,360
Besides, I just arrived at the station.

362
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
I just want to get familiar with the colleges.

363
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm too busy handling

364
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,770
all these cases.

365
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,220
And renting a room

366
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,050
is a waste of money, Master.

367
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,630
Let's go.

368
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,300
I heard you ran away from home.

369
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,590
Who did my mom call this time?

370
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,160
She's familiar with most people in the station.

371
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,200
If that's the case,

372
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,360
I won't go back.

373
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,910
I have rented a house anyway.

374
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,750
It's not easy for both of you.

375
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,590
It's not easy for her either.

376
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,670
I think you should talk to her.

377
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,010
Even if you want to move out,

378
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,210
it shouldn't be the reason that you are angry.

379
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,910
It should indeed be for the convenience of work.

380
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,490
If you talk to to her,

381
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,090
she should understand.

382
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,570
I want to do something

383
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,750
to make her change.

384
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,330
I'll drive you home.

385
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,230
Take a seat.

386
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,910
We are in trouble.

387
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,160
I just had a phone call with Officer Tong

388
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,090
from Tunhou Village.

389
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,560
Tong said...

390
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,400
What is the guy's name again?

391
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,950
Wang Jianguo.

392
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,750
Yes, Wang Jianguo.

393
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,670
He said Wang Jianguo hasn't paid

394
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,800
health insurance for over two years.

395
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,839
And Tong agreed to offer us help.

396
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,190
He has informed the relevant personnel

397
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,480
and done everything he can.

398
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,960
As long as he pays the health insurance,

399
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,869
he will be able to claim the medical expenses.

400
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
Nonsense.

401
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,010
He's in their jurisdiction now.

402
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,150
If it's so easy, why haven't they helped him pay the insurance?

403
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,079
With the medical insurance, we don't need to worry.

404
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,450
You can't talk like that.

405
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,350
After all,

406
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,600
he broke the law in our place.

407
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,830
Can we shift the responsibility to them?

408
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,800
No.

409
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,720
Chief, here is the situation.

410
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,150
Even if the insurance is paid,

411
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,290
he can't claim 100 percent expenses, right?

412
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,110
Wang Jianguo has cirrhosis now.

413
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,690
When will this end?

414
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,560
It's truly a big problem.

415
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,800
And

416
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,430
when we came back from the hospital,

417
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,000
the hospital informed us that

418
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,480
if he doesn't pay the hospital fee tomorrow,

419
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,360
Wang Jianguo will be sent to our station.

420
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,640
That's impossible.

421
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,760
Impossible?

422
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,770
Then let's send the check to the hospital.

423
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,780
Do you think our station is printing checks?

424
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,850
You just wait for them to carry him here.

425
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,790
Haven't I told you that

426
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,590
our priority is to find his family.

427
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,000
I've been looking for his family.

428
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,590
But you called me

429
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,160
to come back to report it

430
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,110
and have a discussion, right?

431
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,290
Yes, I did.

432
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,870
I wanted to discuss it with you.

433
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,870
Forget it. It's late now.

434
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,280
Go back and have a rest.

435
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,330
Go to find his family tomorrow morning.

436
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,000
What about the hospital fee?

437
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,770
I don't understand.

438
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,350
Why do we have to do this.

439
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,230
-You shut up. -You shut up.

440
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,510
All right, go back.

441
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,660
I'll figure it out.

442
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,080
Do you figure out

443
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,070
where Wang Jianguo's son lives?

444
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,380
Maybe.

445
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,530
What do you mean maybe?

446
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,320
Can we enforce the laws with vague information?

447
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,690
I'll make it accurate.

448
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,190
I'm here at the station to make it more accurate.

449
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,970
Hurry up.

450
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,810
I'll wait for you in the car.

451
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,670
Are we looking for him today?

452
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,490
Do you think we can wait till tomorrow?

453
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,890
No.

454
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,150
Then what are you talking about?

455
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,260
Is Zhao Jiwei sleeping inside?

456
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,430
No.

457
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,750
Don't be nervous.

458
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,000
-I heard you rent a house nearby. -Yes.

459
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,750
For the convenience of work.

460
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,970
Can't you let Zhao live together with you?

461
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,150
I told him about it

462
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,510
immediately.

463
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,990
He said he had a relative in the city.

464
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,760
He didn't need to rent a house.

465
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,070
Dawei,

466
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,390
I don't know

467
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,320
how you young people communicate.

468
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,510
But I think

469
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,860
living with relatives

470
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,340
even with siblings

471
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,730
will be inconvenient after a long time.

472
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,380
Yes.

473
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Besides,

474
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,590
the income of you cadets

475
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,480
is not enough

476
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,040
after you rent a house

477
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,270
and give some money to parents. Right?

478
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,090
Yes.

479
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,350
Of course, you are an exception.

480
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,830
You have parents to support you.

481
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,010
It's hard for me too.

482
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,770
How old do you think I am to depend on my parents?

483
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,650
That was why

484
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,350
I wanted to rent an apartment with Yang Shu and Xia Jie.

485
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,970
Them what was the reason why

486
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,010
Zhao refused to rent with you?

487
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,880
He thought it was too expensive?

488
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,170
That's one of the reasons.

489
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,150
I understand. Instructor.

490
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,850
I see.

491
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,170
I will deal with it.

492
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,200
My Master is waiting for me outside.

493
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,100
I have to go.

494
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,980
Do you really understand?

495
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,640
Does he really understand?

496
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,510
Instructor,

497
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,880
there is a fight in Jinbao Street.

498
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,400
There are many participants. It's an emergency.

499
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,920
Two of you stay in the station.

500
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,570
The rest ones.

501
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
You guys, follow me and respond to the call immediately.

502
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,370
Du.

503
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,410
Get everything ready.

504
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,840
Get geared up.

505
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,030
Instructor,

506
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,050
there is a fight on the Second Road. Some guys are using knifes.

507
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,710
What is wrong with tonight?

508
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,010
Wang, Lin.

509
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,790
Take two people to Second Road.

510
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,460
OK.

511
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,650
Be careful with the knifes.

512
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,430
Wang, let's go.

513
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,080
Instructor, it's a fight with weapons in Jinbao Street.

514
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,280
I think we need more people there.

515
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,870
Instructor, take me with you.

516

Now that the living room is empty.

588
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,690
You shouldn't always stay with your relatives.

589
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,550
It's not convenient.

590

No matter what your name is now,

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,530
your name was Wang Gang.

650
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,080
You used to live in Tunhe Village.

651
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,650
You moved here

652
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,670
because of family disputes.

653
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,030
Well, Mr. Wang,

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,980

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,160
No matter where you moved to and

657
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,370
no matter what your last name is,

658
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,010
you are

659
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,110
Wang Jianguo's son.

660
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,110
It can't be changed.

661
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,880
Look.

662
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,100
I broke off the father-son relationship with Wang Jianguo.

663
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,260
We've signed on it.

664
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,250
Mr. Wang, you need to have a conscience.

665
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,510
You can't ignore your father

666
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,610
because he got an incurable disease.

667
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,520
What did you say?

668
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,690
-How interesting. -Right. Right.

669
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,870
Do you believe the old man?

670
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,170
Then I have no conscience.

671
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,560
Mr. Wang.

672
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,770
We shouldn't

673
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,860
judge who is right or wrong in your family.

674
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,160
Actually, no one is right or wrong

675
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,260
in a family.

676
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,940
These are all just trivial matters.

677
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,600
Right?

678
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,020
But.

679
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,640
Speaking of which,

680
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,520
he is your father after all.

681
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,090
Right?

682
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,170
The old man is now in hospital because of liver cirrhosis.

683
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,370
As his son,

684
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,590
you are obligated to take care of him.

685
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,030
It's written in black and white.

686
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,780
He cut ties with me.

687
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,660
My mother's divorce paper is still in the court.

688
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,760
He didn't sign it. He didn't pick it up.

689
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,680
That's his business.

690
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,210
And let me tell you.

691
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,430
I don't want to hear about him and I don't want to care.

692
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,910
He can say whatever he wants about me.

693
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm okay with it If he says I don't support him

694
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,830
and I have no conscience.

695
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,110
It doesn't matter.

696
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,360
He can say whatever he wants.

697
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,440
I don't care.

698
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,060
Let me put it this way.

699
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,200
I should be heartless to that old man.

700
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,030
It's too much.

701
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,780
It's all out of anger, Mr. Wang.

702
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,820
Even though he is an unforgivable man,

703
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,600
you are his son after all.

704
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,120
Enough. Don't reason with me.

705
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,040
It won't work.

706
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,510
Did you mention that I'm not fulfilling my duty to support him?

707
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,680
Fine. I admit it.

708
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,000
What can you do about me?

709
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,970
You want to arrest me?

710
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,200
No.

711
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
In fact, the problems between your father and you

712
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,800
can be solved

713
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,380
through negotiation, right?

714
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,570
The current situation is...

715
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,740
He is still in the hospital.

716
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
All right, you can leave now.

717
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,960
You're not leaving? Fine. I'll go back.

718
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,010
Don't knock on my door again.

719
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,250
I have a family.

720
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,300
If you knock again, I'll complain about your disturbance.

721
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,400
Mr. Wang.

722
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,530
Mr. Wang.

723
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,160
Master.

724
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,920
I think

725
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,750
He didn't something wrong and we leave him to die?

726
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,610
Who didn't ever do something wrong?

727
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,190
You didn't.

728
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,820
You don't care if you have a problem?

729
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,620
What has every father done wrong in the world?

730
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,960
Fine. Master.

731
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,190
Just take me as a vent.

732
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,560
Gosh.

733
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,840
Mom, what are you doing?

734
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,390
I'd better go to Qingdao.

735
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,670
I won't be annoy you anymore.

736
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,270
Mom.

737
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,050
I'm sorry.

738
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,470
I was rude yesterday.

739
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,000
I've thought it over.

740
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,300
Your aunt was right.

741
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,090
All these years,

742
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,680
I have thought blindly by myself

743
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,090
and got myself into trouble.

744
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,980
You've grown up.

745
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,520
You have your own plans.

746
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,320
I've always

747
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,070
controlled you in my way.

748
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,030
If you follow my order,

749
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,320
you will be unhappy.

750
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,750
If you don't listen to me,

751
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,140
I will be unhappy.

752
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,450
Nothing can be solved.

753
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,150
So,

754
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,760
I'll go to the beach to have some peace.

755
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,480
Do you really think so?

756
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,800
What else can I think?

757
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,990
But you suddenly want to go there.

758
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,400
I don't have time to book a place for you to live.

759
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,950
I've talked to your aunt.

760
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,350
I'm still staying with your aunt.

761
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,680
Don't worry.

762
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,870
It's not my first time living in your aunt's house.

763
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,820
OK. Let me help you pack thing up.

764
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,190
Mom, I've prepared everything for you.

765
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,770
I've prepared some plasters for you.

766
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,940
If your back hurts again, remember to put it on.

767
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,290
This is mosquito repellent.

768
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,880
Aunt lives by the beach after all.

769
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,750
There might be mosquitoes.

770
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,380
And cold medicine.

771
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,070
You must take care of yourself there.

772
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,390
By the way, mom,

773
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,740
I'll transfer the money to you.

774
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,310
I have your aunt in Qingdao.

775
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,060
I won't spend much money.

776
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,480
Yes. You are right.

777
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,430
But you shouldn't bother her.

778
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,010
Aunt has been taking care of

779
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,440
us for so many years.

780
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,330
All right.

781
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,210
You just came to work.

782
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,160
Where did you get so much money?

783
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,590
I got my salary.

784
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,680
I don't have much to spend money on.

785
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,680
It's free to eat in the office.

786
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,030
The police uniform is distributed by the station.

787
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,230
You should take enough money when you have a journey.

788
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,620
Just take it.

789
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,450
Just remember.

790
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,150
Don't let aunt spend money on you.

791
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,250
If your dad were still alive...

792
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Enough, Mum.

793
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,240
There you go again.

794
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,870
Aren't we good now?

795
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,430
You have me.

796
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,300
Because of you,

797
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,750
I always think about

798
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,660
whether being a police officer

799
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,310
is safe or not.

800
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,030
It's not a big deal whether the work is tiring.

801
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,630
You always make me worried.

802
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,430
You became a police officer

803
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,340
and fulfilled your father's last wish.

804
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,010
I can't stop you.

805
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
Neither can I.

806
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,020
But we can make a request to the bureau.

807
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,790
You can change to another office

808
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,520
where your work is easier and you don't have to work overtime.

809
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,940
All right, mom.

810
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,080
Let's not talk about this.

811
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,970
Go to bed early after packing up.

812
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,310
You have to catch the train tomorrow.

813
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,660
Actually, I feel contradicted.

814
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,100
I haven't worked for years.

815
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,040
If you hadn't become a police officer,

816
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,310
we would have lost contact with the bureau.

817
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,600
So I am not saying you can't be a policewoman.

818
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,330
You can change a post.

819
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,750
All right, mom.

820
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,250
Go to sleep, OK?

821
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,900
Let me help you pack things up.

822
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,750
When you get up tomorrow,

823
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,060
you can just carry your luggage and leave.

824
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,160
You can go to sleep.

825
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,860
They say good deeds lead to good results.

826
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,870
How can I throw a rock at my foot?

827
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,219
Zhao Jiwei. Earthquake!

828
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,010
Wake up!

829
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,719
Wake up!

830
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,730
Zhao Jiwei.

831
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,719
Yang Shu.

832
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,639
You are awake too?

833
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,409
He is snoring so loud.

834
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,340
My bed is trembling in my room.

835
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,179
How can I go to sleep?

836
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,969
What kind of martial art is he practicing?

837
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,110
How can he snore like this?

838
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,330
Zhao Jiwei, wake up!

839
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,760
Zhao Jiwei!

840
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,640
Zhao Jiwei! Zhao!

841
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,690
Wake him up!

842
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,130
Zhao Jiwei!

843
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,200
Pinch his nose! Pinch his nose!

844
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,040
Zhao Jiwei. Wake up. Zhao Jiwei.

845
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,070
He opened his eyes.

846
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,470
I beg you.

847
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,200
Can you stop snoring?

848
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,920
Darn it.

849
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,810
Wake up.

850
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,790
He's still asleep.

851
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,920
Jiwei.

852
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,850
Zhao Jiwei!

853
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,780
Wake up, OK?

854
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,750
Amazing.

855
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,640
Dawei, you brought him in.

856
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,590
You must be responsible.

857
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,690
How?

858
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,660
Just get him into your room.

859
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,230
Close the door and window.

860
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,020
You sleep here.

861
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,010
Why should I?

862
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,960
Look at him.

863
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,020
How long has it been since he slept well last time?

864
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,600
That's why he snores like this.

865
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,980
Just let him stay in your room

866
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,490
for a few days.

867
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,360
It will be fine.

868
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,120
Yang Shu.

869
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,570
Yang Shu, you have to help me.

870
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm going to bed.

871
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,280
He is still not awake?

872
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,250
I deserve it.

873
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,660
It's really annoying that the electric bikes are missing.

874
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,190
The police are here.

875
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,680
The police are here.

876
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,650
The police are here.

877
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,360
Let's take a look.

878
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,250
Let's have a look.

879
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,690
Who called the police?

880
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,520
I called the police.

881
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,680
Do you have your ID card?

882
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,110
-Qiu Chenli. -Qiu Chenli.

883
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,830
Register her.

884
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,460
OK.

885
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,120
Tell me about it.

886
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:51,980
Officer,

887
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,830
seven or eight electric bikes are missing

888
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,290
in our neighborhood.

889
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,890
Tell me.

890
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,480
What job are you police doing?

891
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,250
Exactly.

892
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,530
You only ask us to register.

893
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,200
We know our electric bikes are missing

894
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,960
even though we don't register.

895
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,750
You have to solve it as soon as possible.

896
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,970
We are waiting to ride the electric bikes to work.

897
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,050
Yes. My bike is a new one.

898
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:05,730
It's not easy for us.

899
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,400
We need it every day.

900
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,820
All right, don't worry.

901
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,680
Calm down.

902
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,400
It's useless

903
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,400
to get agitated.

904
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,750
We're here.

905
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,670
The police are for the people, right?

906
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,590
So don't worry.

907
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,320
We set up a special team

908
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,680
for the electric electric bike theft case.

909
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,270
I'm in charge of the details.

910
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,450
Please give us some time.

911
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,230
I'm saying

912
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,610
we're waiting to go to work.

913
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,330
Yes, I understand.

914
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,840
But we still have to follow the rules.

915
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,860
We have to register first.

916
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,420
Otherwise, we can't do our work, right?

917
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,870
Yes, we will cooperate with you.

918
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,300
Let's start with the ladies.

919
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,200
OK.

920
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,910
Get out of the way. None of your business.

921
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,290
We must hand over Liu today.

922
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,310
Master, what happened?

923
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,120
-Stop arguing. -Calm down.

924
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,400
Stop arguing. Calm down.

925
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,560
Get up.

926
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,320
Get up.

927
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,110
Make way.

928
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,910
You have grievances.

929
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,530
We can solve it, right?

930
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,150
Slow down.

931
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,910
Screaming won't solve any problem.

932
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,210
Why is it here?

933
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,180
As a daughter, why did you leave him here?

934
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,160
If your father is sick,

935
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,280
go to see a doctor.

936
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,010
This is not a hospital, OK?

937
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,930
Stop wasting time.

938
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,520
Hurry up.

939
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,770
Take him to the hospital.

940
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,470
Come on.

941
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,250
Go.

942
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,160
Wait, wait.

943
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,010
Dad, say something.

944
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,570
You go inside

945
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,190
and tell the police about the problem.

946
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,410
OK.

947
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,590
Leave me here.

948
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,520
I'll wait for you here.

949
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,410
OK.

950
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,380
Chief, we can't let him stay here.

951
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,050
We have to carry him in.

952
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,360
He's over 70 years old.

953
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,610
What if something happens?

954
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,970
Zhi Jie.

955
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,870
Zhi Jie, go to the community hospital.

956
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,860
Get a doctor and a nurse.

957
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,730
Just in case.

958
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,030
-OK, go. -OK.

959
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,320
Listen, calm down.

960
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,120
-This room. -Hurry.

961
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,150
This room. This way.

962
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,910
Come on.

963
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,090
The door is too narrow.

964
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,860
The door is too narrow.

965
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,920
Put me down!

966
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,690
Put me down.

967
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Put it here.

968
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,610
Just lie on the table.

969
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,430
The door panel.

970
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,750
We need the door panel.

971
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,920
Lying here is comfortable.

972
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,650
Come on.

973
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,680
Dad, be careful.

974
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,440
Come on.

975
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,280
OK.

976
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,400
Here.

977
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,780
Are you OK? Here.

978
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,210
Slowly.

979
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,320
Lie down.

980
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,990
Lie down.

981
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,600
Be careful.

982
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,360
Where is the doctor?

983
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,010
Where is the doctor?

984
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,600
Coming.

985
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,870
Doctor, hurry up.

986
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,690
Get a doctor!

987
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,920
Sir, what's wrong?

988
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,790
I'm not feeling well anywhere.

989
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,880
Did you see that?

990
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,310
This is the video

991
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,200
we got from the surveillance

992
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,550
on the road.

993
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,860
The couple were walking on the road with their child.

994
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,930
Suddenly, your dog rushed out.

995
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,700
Look.

996
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,900
He ran after the kid

997
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,780
and she

998
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,380
fell and got hurt.

999
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,610
Look here.

1000
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,250
Our police officers

1001
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,680
accompanied the child's father

1002
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,220
to proactively

1003
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,520
settle with you.

1004
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,480
Your father...

1005
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,280
Your father was irritated

1006
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,230
and fell down.

1007
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,150
Besides,

1008
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,790
you have

1009
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,420
no dog license.

1010
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,000
This is illegal.

1011
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,710
Besides, it was against the urban management regulation

1012
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,730
that he did not leash the dog.

1013
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,650
So in this matter,

1014
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,560
the other side did nothing wrong.

1015
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,480
It was your father's fault.

1016
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,350
Chief Wang. You can't say that.

1017
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,390
Right.

1018
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,110
How do you know

1019
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,500
they came back to reconcile with my father?

1020
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,650
My father fell down

1021
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,860
because they came back to provoke him.

1022
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,990
Chief Gao.

1023
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,860
Show the video from the law enforcement recorder to him.

1024
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,510
That one.

1025
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,590
Pay us for wasting our time.

1026
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,430
Let's be reasonable.

1027
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,510
And then I will pay you. OK?

1028
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,980
You haven't grown up yet. I'll compensate you my ass.

1029
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,690
Sir, don't fight.

1030
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,490
Don't fight, Sir.

1031
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,520
Don't fight.

1032
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,500
Calm down. Don't fight.

1033
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,210
What are you talking about?

1034
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,450
He's unreasonable.

1035
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,590
-Why do you have to reason with him? -You live in vain at such an old age.

1036
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,840
Say it again if you dare.

1037
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,560
Stop it.

1038
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,350
What do you think?

1039
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,230
That man said my dad lived in vain

1040
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,100
at such an old age.

1041
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,780
Chief, listen to it.

1042
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,800
Didn't he say so on purpose

1043
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,700
to piss my father off?

1044
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,600
Your father

1045
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,970
was wrong.

1046
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
He went out to walk the dog without a leash.

1047
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,020
The dog scared the kid.

1048
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,490
It's understandable for the child's father

1049
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,190
to be angry.

1050
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,740
As for the responsibility

1051
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,310
he needs to take

1052
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,600
for causing your father's illness,

1053
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,310
the law will judge it.

1054
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,750
It seems that your father collapsed

1055
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,120
because of his poor health.

1056
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,850
Chief Wang,

1057
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,870
Why do you always defend the other side?

1058
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,610
Right.

1059
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,590
Did you get any benefits from them?

1060
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,370
Say it again.

1061
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,320
♫Like a seed♫

1062
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,650

00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,350
Who else do you think should the blame?

1086
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
On this early morning,

1087
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,470
a group of people came here angrily.

1088
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,230
Have you ever thought about this?

1089
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,420
Paint.

1090
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,080
What are you doing?

1091
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,000
How dare you paint here?

1092
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,410
Don't run. Calm down.

1093
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,070
Come on.

1094
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,090
Calm down. Put the knife down.

1095
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,160
Don't run. Put the knife down.

1096
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:42,970
Officer.

1097
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,210
No. Did you see it?

1098
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,460
You didn't see it.

1099
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,230
How could you say that

1100
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,620
we poured ink in their house?

1101
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,080
Who said it?

1102
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,290
Do you have any evidence?

1103
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,640
Right. Do you have any evidence?
