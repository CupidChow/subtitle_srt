Master.

6
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,940
When we were in the police academy,

7
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,060
such case was talked about.

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,640
Many criminals like to leave a mark

9
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,050
when they commit crimes.

10
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,500
This is probably a mark for him.

11
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,660
He entered the bedroom

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,930
and searched the bedside cabinet.

13
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,460
After taking such a big risk,

14
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,140
it's very likely that he's carrying a weapon.

15
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,540
As for the kitchen knife on the table,

16
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,289
I think it's a habit.

17
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,979
That makes sense.

18
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,180
-Look. -It's here.

19
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,970
This one?

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,660
Yes.

21
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,710
He went to the south highway around the city.

22
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,870
The south highway around the city.

23
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,970
He lives in the south.

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,310
Look. Look at this.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,640
Here.

26
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,810
Down here is the Liuhang Town.

27
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,340
He lives in Liuhang?

28
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,329
That's easy.

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,180
Zhang.

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,460
Our people caused you trouble again.

32
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,579
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,570
Your people

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,040
gave us a chance to make contributions.

35
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,860
Let's make a deal first.

36
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,140
If we catch him,

37
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,390
whose is he?

38
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,620
Of course he'll be ours.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,260
He committed the crime in our place

40
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,380
and we found him first.

41
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,730
He's ours.

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,140

43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,260

How about this?

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,620
We'll help you investigate.

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,020
But it's on one condition.

48
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,140
If we catch him, let him stay.

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,510
He'll be ours.

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,830
Let's catch him first.

51
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,450
Okay.

52
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,740
Let's go and take a look first.

[The Liuhang Police Station]

54
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,320
This car

55
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,490
has never come out

56
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,050
after entering a blind spot.

57
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,450
Maybe his home is nearby.

58
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,170
What's there?

59
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,060
This is a residential area.

60
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,980
But as far as we know,

61
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,300
most of the residents here

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,040
went to work in the city and don't come back.

63
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,410
There aren't many thefts.

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Could it be that

65
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,100
he works in the city

66
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,560
and made off with something when came home

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,970
almost the Spring Festival?

68
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,550
If it's really like what you said,

69
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,140
he must be experienced.

70
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,820
But isn't the police station in charge of the experienced ones?

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,420
It seems not there.

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Why don't we go there and take a look?

73

Master.

76
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,100
I have a stomachache suddenly.

77
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,380
Why don't you go with them?

78
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,810
I'll keep monitoring here.

79
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,060
Okay.

80
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,540

Let's go, Bao.

86
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Let's go over there.

87
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,510
Officer Xia, what do you think we should do about this?

88
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,260
What is it?

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,850
That old lady

90
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,270
has been here several times.

91
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,370
Her last name is Zhang.

92
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,660
We all call her Mrs. Zhang.

93
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,770
She has no children

94
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,240
and rely on the subsistence allowance and picking up garbage to make a living.

95
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,870
That little girl

96
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,130
was a abandoned baby found

97
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,260
when she picked up garbage six years ago.

98
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,770
She have raised the girl until the girl was six and a half years old.

99
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,020
Now the girl is going to school in September.

100
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,450
She comes

101
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,890
to register the child.

102
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,610
It's not in line with the residency policy.

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,800
Yes.

104
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,660
The girl has no birth certificate.

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,640
And they didn't go through

106
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,880
the formal adoption procedures.

107
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,860
Besides,

108
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,700
the old lady is 76 years old this year.

109
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,140
The two of them are exactly 70 years apart.

110
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,780
It's not in line with the adoption policy.

111
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,540
The child has to go to school.

112
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,460
But she can't enroll in school

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
without the household registration.

114
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,409
-Officer Xia. What should we do? -Grandma, look.

115
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,260
Here.

116
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,740
Grandma, smile.

117
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,170
Grandma.

118
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,780
Officer,

119
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,020
I've been here five times.

120
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,180
Can you register my daughter?

121
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,020
Grandma.

122
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,940
This child is calling you...

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,780
She used to call me grandma.

124
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,460
But the officer said

125
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,500
she could be registered when we have an adoptive relationship.

126
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,460
So I let her change in calling me.

127
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,790
Call me mom.

128
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,140
You...

129
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,800
Come, Bao.

130
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,020
Call me mom.

131
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,540
You...

132
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,100
How can you be registered if you don't call me?

133
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,140
What should we do in the future?

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
Are you named Bao?

135
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,060
Bao, here.

136
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,450
Bao, hurry.

137
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,460
Hurry up. We always meet good people.

138
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,660
Take it.

139
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,290
You should thank the officer.

140
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,780
Thank you, officer.

141
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,780
You're welcome.

142
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,120
After you go to school, you have to study hard.

143
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,780
Grandma.

144
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,570
Your situation is indeed complicated.

145
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,460
You can't register this time.

146
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,260
Take the child back first

147
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,410
and don't have to come here anymore.

148
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
I promise you

149
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,190
I will help you find

150
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,570
the most appropriate way to solve.

151
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,820
The child should register

152
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,920
to attend school.

153
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,370
Won't it delay her attending school?

154
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,100
No, I promise.

155
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,940
Grandma, you have a hard life.

156
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,620
Don't waste your time on coming to the police station.

157
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,909
Go back first.

158
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,860
I'll figure it out for you.

159
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,630
Okay, thank you, thank you.

160
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,300
You're welcome.

161
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,780
-Thank you. -Let me see you off.

162
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,900
Bao, let's go.

163
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,500
Go.

164
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,610
Great.

165
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,120
Bao, you are six years old.

166
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,380
Can you take care of grandma now?

167
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,740
Then you should listen to your grandma.

168
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,670
Grandma, I'm hungry.

169
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,450
-Grandma, I'm hungry. -Okay, let's go home and have dinner.

170
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,100
Miss, goodbye.

171
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,860
This...

172
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,770
I'll come back later.

173
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,500
Grandma,

174
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,380
can you buy me a drumstick?

175
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,900
Sure. Sure.

176
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,820
Do you know

177
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,420
your ID number?

178
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,060
Yes.

179
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,430
Then fill this out.

180
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,640
Then sign

181
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,870
below where you should sign.

182
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,690
Sign here.

183
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Officer Xia.

184
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,409
Why did you bring the trash bag back?

185
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,539
Grandma said she'll pick it up later.

186
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,059
I think it's inappropriate to put it at the door.

187
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,820
And I'm afraid it would be lost.

188
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,650
So I brought it in.

189
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,300
This old lady is so funny.

190
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,980
She didn't take the garbage bag away

191
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,900
but with the twice coming.

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,510
Have you filled this out?

193
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,260
Yes.

194
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,740
OK, wait a moment.

195
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,580
Chief. Instructor.

196
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,770
Are you going out?

197
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,100
Yes, we're going to the bureau for a meeting.

198
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,780
What's the matter?

199
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,440
An old lady surnamed Zhang

200
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,710
adopted an abandoned baby.

201
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,020
The child is about to go to school,

202
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,820
but she doesn't have the household registration.

203
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,220
I know it.

204
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,900
-Chief, I've reported it to you. -Yes.

205
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,460
The old lady

206
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,660
must not in line the requirements of adopting a child.

207
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,820
We can't let her registered.

208
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,470
But that girl is going to be seven soon.

209
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,970
She can't go to school without the household registration.

210
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,100
Xia Jie,

211
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,540
the station

212
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,040
attaches great importance to this at first too.

213
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,860
The instructor

214
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,180
has been going to the civil affairs bureau

215
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,220
for many times.

216
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,630
Don't mention the difficulty of the policy.

217
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,740
There's a problem that we can't avoid.

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,730
The old lady is 76 years old.

219
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,980
But the child is only six years old.

220
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,490
What if

221
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,570
the old lady can't make it,

222
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
what about the child?

223
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,230
Then what should we do

224
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,100
about the child attending school now?

225
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,770
Send her to the Social Welfare Center.

226
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,450
Welfare center?

227
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,900
Xia Jie, from the long run,

228
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,250
it's beneficial to the child's health growth

229
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,060
and education.

230
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,250
The welfare center is the best choice.

231
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,300
Yes.

232
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,740
We'll go to the bureau for a meeting first.

233
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,700
Then we'll take a look at the welfare center when we're free.

234
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,190
-Okay? -Okay.

235
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,450
This is weird.

236
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,820
Weird.

237
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,580
We saw him go in,

238
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,980
but why can't we find him?

239
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,090
Yeah.

240
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,020
Don't worry.

241
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,580
How big is Liuhang in total?

242
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,220
As long as he belongs here,

243
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,940
I will find a way to catch him.

244
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,420
Master! Master!

245
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,020
What's wrong?

246
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,320
I have a clue. Let's go.

247
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,340
I think

248
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,220
there are many surveillance cameras

249
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,530
from the city to Liuhang.

250
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,770
He wears a hoodie

251
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,980
every time he commits the crime.

252
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,460
Isn't he afraid

253
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,260
the surveillance followed his car

254
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,380
all the way here?

255
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,640
So I reasoned backwards.

256
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,880
He came to Liuhang for so long.

257
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,140
It's probably just a cover-up.

258
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,100
I didn't expect that, Master.

259
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,340
I've made some progress.

260
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,580
Look.

261
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,690
This is his car.

262
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,580
Although he changed the plate,

263
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,660
master,

264
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,300
you reminded me

265
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,980
there was a obvious crack

266
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,100
on his windshield glass.

267
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,700
This crack,

268
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,580
when passing through the intersection with street lights,

269
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,100
would have a very obvious reflection.

270
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,100
So he thought

271
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
he could fool us.

272
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,510
When he went back,

273
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,860
he didn't wear the hoodie.

274
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,740
Look.

275
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,460
The CCTV clearly

276
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,940
caught his face.

277
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,620
Good boy. You're really something.

278
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,700
It's really him.

279
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,530
Well done, Zhang.

280
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,250
There are no weak troops under a capable general.

281
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm not a capable general.

282
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,510
He's much better

283
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,540
than the young me.

284
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
He's a top detective at the police academy.

285
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,020
Impressive, bro.

286
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,390
It's really good.

287
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,250
Don't listen to the social rumors.

288
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,680
The country has increased the investment of social welfare.

289
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,860
The condition of the welfare center

290
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,860
is getting better.

291
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,910
What they need

292
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,810
is not just food and clothing.

293
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,090
Go in and have a look.

294
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,940
They also want

295
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,130
mom's embrace and company.

296
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,940
In this aspect, definitely

297
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,500
the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

298
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,460
Are there many holes

299
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,940
on the tangerine?

300
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,410
Mom! Mom!

301
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,880
Mom! Mom!

302
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,300
The children here

303
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,130
call them mothers when they meet adult women.

304
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,060
Come on.

305
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,260
They lack nothing

306
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,540
but mothers' love.

307
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,220
Are you well-behaved today?

308
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,890
Yes.

309
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,380
So beautiful.

310
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,300
Kiss.

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
Go play.

312
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,620
He has a magical flute.

313
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,980
Then do you know...

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,070
We can pick her up.

315
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,060
Register her household here.

316
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,060
We'll send her to school then.

317
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,190
That's our responsibility.

318
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,420
President Xu.

319
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,050
What is it?

320
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
There's a situation here

321
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,510
that needs you to go over.

322
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,040
Go ahead.

323
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,020
Officer Xia, then I won't see you out.

324
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,580
Goodbye.

325
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,300
OK.

326
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,940
Then I'll

327
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,160
report to you on this case.

328
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,300
We've contacted the Xianqianjie Police Station.

329
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,940
The night before yesterday,

330
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,860
the same person

331
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,100
stole in two houses in their jurisdiction.

332
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,690
Then the next night,

333
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,000
he entered Yinfeng Community in our jurisdiction.

334
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,950
In the past two nights,

335
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,900
the total value of his theft

336
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,180
was more than 80,000 yuan.

337
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,180
It's a huge crime value.

338
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,420
After he left our jurisdiction,

339
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,180
he went straight to Liuhang Town in the south of the city.

340
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,800
He changed the plate in the blind spot of Liuhang,

341
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,180
then he turned around.

342
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,770
He got on the south highway around the city

343
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,770
and kept going north.

344
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,140
He got off the highway

345
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,940
200 kilometers away in north of Qibei

346
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,180
and entered Qibei City.

347
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,340
Finally he disappeared in a residential community.

348
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,890
According to our initial judgment,

349
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,260
this thief is from Qibei.

350
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,850
Based on the situation,

351
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,970
he should stay in Qibei for the Spring Festival.

352
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,100
If we go there now,

353
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,420
we should be able to catch him.

354
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,420
Captain Luo,

355
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,310
look, this case involves

356
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,550
over 80,000 yuan.

357
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,460
It's a big case.

358
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,100
The criminal police group should handle with it.

359
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,180
80,000 is a big case for you.

360
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
But it's really not for us.

361
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,780
Chief Wang, I'm not dodging.

362
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,540
Some time ago

363
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,140
there were two robbery and murder cases occurred in the city.

364
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,890
One of them

365
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,340
hasn't been broken yet.

366
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,010
The whole team

367
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,760
was on these two cases.

368
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,810
I haven't slept for 48 hours.

369
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,180
I agree with Zhijie.

370
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,740
This guy is currently in Qibei.

371
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,340
I suggest

372
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,870
contacting the Qibei police

373
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,530
and ask them to help solve the case.

374
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,660
Luo,

375
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,420
Qibei is only over 200 kilometers

376
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,780
from here, right?

377
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,380
But it's not in our province.

378
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,620
This case

379
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
is not too big or too small.

380
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,420
It's hard to attract the attention of the higher-ups.

381
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,660
It must be inconvenient to coordinate.

382
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,020
Why don't we go there ourselves

383
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
and arrest them?

384
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,560
Then

385
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,700
put it after the Spring Festival.

386
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,170
His belongs to Qibei.

387
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
He can't escape.

388
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,730
If we do it before the Spring Festival,

389
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,850
I can't get any help.

390
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,940
Captain Luo,

391
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,540
we need to solve the case,

392
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,080
but we also need our lives.

393
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,490
Look at what you have become

394
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,460
in this state.

395
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,780
By the way,

396
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,320
if you are not on duty during the Spring Festival,

397
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,340
let's play together

398
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,360
to upgrade?

399
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,490
Upgrade what?

400
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,980
If the case was solved before the Spring Festival,

401
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,890
we'll be upgraded.

402
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,980
If it is not,

403
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,400
don't upgrade,

404
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,210
just degrade.

405
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,619
Bye.

406
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,640
Okay.

407
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,260
Take a nap in the car.

408
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,670
Okay, don't worry.

409
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,540
See you.

410
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,500
Chief, I think

411
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,859
as long as we can locate this area, it could be dealt with.

412
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,140
Chief, Chief Gao.

413
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,220
I don't think it's a big problem.

414
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,220
Chief,

415
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,340
what should we do?

416
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,410
What should we do?

417
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,500
Chief, I don't think we can wait for this case.

418
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,340
Look.

419
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
The 100-day operation

420
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,970
is officially over on the 30th of the lunar year.

421
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,980
If we can't catch him,

422
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
it means we still have a case to solve.

423
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,850
Then the 100-day operation will be ruined.

424
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,580
Chief Gao is right.

425
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,370
And this is a new year's case.

426
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,060
If the case are not solved at the beginning of the year,

427
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,570
the cases next won't go smoothly.

428
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,570
Truly.

429
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,760
So I suggest

430
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,060
catching him

431
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,940
for good luck.

432
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,820
You're a materialist. How can you be superstitious?

433
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,220
Well, it's not...

434
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,300
That is...

435
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,420
Okay, it's the new year.

436
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,980
Let's be superstitious.

437
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,250
Then who's going?

438
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,530
Sir.

439
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,140
Come in.

440
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,650
Xincheng.

441
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,430
Chief Cheng.

442
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,210
Chief, please come out.

443
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,860
I have something to ask you.

444
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,500
Chief, it's cold outside.

445
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,700
I'll make it short.

446
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,220
The Spring Festival is coming.

447
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,820
I want to leave all my annual leave

448
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,260
in the Spring Festival.

449
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,490
I'm going to the Northeast of China.

450
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,700
Why are you going to the Northeast of China?

451
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,900
Well,

452
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,140
it's about Yue Wei.

453
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,940
Li Dawei and I

454
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,020
watched his surveillance video all day

455
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,140
but found nothing.

456
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,380
Maybe he really has nothing.

457
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,600
Yeah.

458
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,810
But I always think

459
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,650
something is wrong.

460
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,180
So I want to take advantage of the Spring Festival

461
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,660
to visit his hometown.

462
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,780
And go to

463
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,020
the police station where he used to work

464
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,100
to learn more about the situation

465
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,700
and see if there's any new discovery.

466
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,620
That's a good idea.

467
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,260
Right.

468
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,740
But don't use your annual leave.

469
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,080
Take it as a business trip.

470
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,870
No.

471
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,900
We're not even sure

472
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,700
if we can find anything new.

473
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,730
Just take it as Dawei and I

474
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,140
are going on a trip.

475
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,300
But, Chief,

476
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,810
about this time we go to the Northeast of China,

477
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,050
please keep it a secret for a while.

478
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,530
OK, keep it a secret.

479
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,260
I know.

480
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,620
Okay, you can go in first.

481
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,060
Hello.

482
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,350
Where does Mrs. Zhang live?

483
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,340
Turn right at the end.

484
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,140
-Thank you. -At the end.

485
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,700
Bao.

486
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,810
Grandma! Grandma!

487
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,240
The police is here.

488
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,770
Grandma.

489
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,930
You're here.

490
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,060
Can you register now?

491
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,530
My eyelids are twitching so early in the morning.

492
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,010
I wonder if you can come today.

493
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,070
See if it works.

494
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,380
Grandma, I didn't buy anything.

495
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,780
You and Bao can eat these fruits and snacks.

496
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,090
I'll put them here.

497
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,830
I also bought a bag.

498
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,130
There are a set of stationery.

499
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,780
Bao is going to school in summer.

500
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,380
Bao, look,

501
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,460
what did sister bring to you.

502
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,220
Take it.

503
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,700
Why don't you say thanks.

504
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,250
What did I teach you?

505
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,060
Thank you, officer.

506
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,140
You're welcome.

507
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,050
Open it and have a look.

508
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,460
Miss, come in.

509
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,260
-Come in. -I'm not going in, grandma.

510
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,540
I'm not going in. I'm not going in.

511
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,820
Well...

512
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,710
Grandma, I'm here to tell you...

513
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,940
I know. I know.

514
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,620
Is that we can register now?

515
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,250
When are we going?

516
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,740
Well, the household registration... Grandma.

517
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,300
Look how beautiful this bag is.

518
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,210
Why didn't you call me mom?

519
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,580
She doesn't even let us registered.

520
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,760
When can we do it?

521
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,620
Well...

522
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,010
Grandma, here's the thing.

523
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,940
I'm afraid you can't wait.

524
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,420
I came to tell you first.

525
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,020
About Bao,

526
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,500
we're in the process of asking the higher-ups.

527
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,660
Please believe that

528
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,050
there will be a good result.

529
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,660
Xia Jie.

530
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,500
we

531
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
can't just look at the present.

532
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,680
Think about it.

533
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,900
The old lady is 76 this year.

534
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,030
If she dies one day,

535
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,100
the child will completely

536
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,210
become an orphan.

537
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,140
What will you do then?

538
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,460
So,

539
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,090
in the long run,

540
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,550
sending to the social welfare center

541
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,490
is the best way.

542
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,490
Chief, go to Mrs. Zhang's house and have a look.

543
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,900
If now take the girl

544
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,940
from their house,

545
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,580
is a harm to both of them.

546
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,140
After sending the child

547
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,500
to the social welfare center,

548
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,140
the old lady could

549
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,300
visit her often.

550
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,350
Chief, you're kind-hearted.

551
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,060
Look at the grandma and Bao,

552
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,380
they're like a whole.

553
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,180
If we have to tear them apart,

554
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,260
it's too cruel.

555
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,580
How are we cruel?

556
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,540
There is no policy.

557
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,290
But policies are dead.

558
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,400
People are alive.

559
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,580
So we need to think of a way now.

560
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,160
By the way, the instructor

561
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,820
is in charge of the household registration.

562
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,180
Go find her.

563
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,780
Let her think of a way.

564
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,340
Go.

565
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,340
Guoguo, let's go home.

566
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,940
Guoguo, let's go home.

567
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,090
We're going home.

568
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,990
On the 7th of every month,

569
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,260
we'll visit your home.

570
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,340
Every three months,

571
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,460
you bring her back for a medical examination.

572
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,220
Besides, if anything happens,

573
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,700
you can contact us anytime.

574
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,340
OK.

575
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,740
Guoguo, come home with me.

576
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,700
Are you happy?

577
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,860
No.

578
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,020
No?

579
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,180
Then would I give you a hug?

580
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,460
Give you a hug.

581
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,500
Okay, take care.

582
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,530
Okay, thank you.

583
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,300
You're welcome.

584
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,940
Thank you.

585
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,780
Take care on the way.

586
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,500
OK. Bye.

587
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,260
Guoguo, bye.

588
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,900
Bye.

589
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,220
Hello.

590
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,900
Is the president not back?

591
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,620
No, I just want to ask.

592
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,490
What was that?

593
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,810
Just now, we found a substitute mother

594
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,220
for a child again.

595
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,330
A substitute mother?

596
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,020
That is...

597
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,500
Our welfare center signed a contract

598
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,300
with her family

599
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,480
and let one of our children

600
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,030
to her family for adoption.

601
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,740
Both parties have agreed

602
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,860
on the terms of the child's adoption.

603
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,260
We will pay a certain subsidy every month.

604
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,840
But

605
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,620
it requires certain conditions.

606
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,460
That's great.

607
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,220
Thank you.

608
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,100
You're welcome.

609
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,180
Have a seat inside.

610
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,300
No, I'll wait outside.

611
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,660
Okay, go ahead.

612
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,540
Okay, bye.

613
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,180
Bye.

614
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,300
This one.

615
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,380
Grandma.

616
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,290
Coming.

617
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,620
Grandma, where is Bao?

618
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,780
Bao wants to eat tomatoes on sticks.

619
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,740
I gave her five yuan.

620
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,220
She went to buy tomatoes on sticks.

621
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,060
This...

622
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,820
Grandma, let's talk inside.

623
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,250
Okay.

624
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Slowly. Come.

625
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,810
Slowly.

626
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,980
Over there.

627
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,740
Here.

628
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,500
Come in.

629
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,330
Thank you.

630
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,010
Grandma, I put it on the table.

631
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,420
Grandma.

632
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,300
Grandma, it's only three yuan.

633
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,870
Good girl.

634
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,140
Grandma, take a bite.

635
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,010
Take a bite. It's sweet.

636
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,340
I don't want it.

637
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,700
Look at her.

638
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,580
She always thinks of me when she eats.

639
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,580
I'm not eating. You eat.

640
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,900
Grandma, bite it.

641
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,660
It's so sweet.

642
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,370
How much did you say

643
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
the old lady's subsistence allowance is per month?

644
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,180
680 yuan for a child a month.

645
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,850
She's over 60 years old

646
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,230
has increased 30 percent.

647
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,900
They two together

648
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,780
have about 1,600 or 1,700 yuan

649
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,940
a month.

650
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,510
Our subsidy is

651
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,810
1,000 yuan a month.

652
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,560
Although it's less than 3,000 yuan together,

653
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,140
it can help.

654
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,620
President, you mean...

655
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,500
You agree?

656
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,840
Thank you so much, president.

657
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,590
They don't need to be apart.

658
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,940
They'll be satisfied

659
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,790
with just a little happiness.

660
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,970
Thank you so much.

661
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,890
You're welcome.

662
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,300
Here, have some water.

663
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,020
Grandma.

664
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,140
Grandma, stop working.

665
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,210
Grandma, bite again.

666
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,500
You...

667
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,100
Eat it yourself.

668
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,860
Good girl, eat it yourself.

669
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,620
Eat it yourself.

670
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,220
Bite it.

671
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,380
[Shopping Street for the Spring Festival]

672
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,700
Jia, don't pack them all for me.

673
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,340
What are you eating for the Spring Festival?

674
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,220
I have.

675
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,880
I can buy it then.

676
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,550
Jia, your mom called

677
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,230
that she would spend the Spring Festival with you.

678
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,700
I can spend it myself.

679
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,140
Jia.

680
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,050
It's not easy for your mother.

681
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,780
I can tell

682
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,740
she really misses you.

683
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,820
I know, but she...

684
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,930
I guess it's Dawei.

685
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,660
-Jia, you're home. -Dawei.

686
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,930
Jia.

687
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,100
I heard that your painting

688
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,420
was chosen

689
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,340
by the youth art exhibition, right?

690
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,060
Every dog has its day.

691
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Why are there so many dogs?

692
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,320
Introduce one to me.

693
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,820
Let me tell you.

694
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,740
She was embarrassed

695
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,020
when I asked her to send it.

696
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,100
How did it go?

697
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,300
Two were sent.

698
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,820
One was chosen at that time

699
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,820
for the official competition.

700
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,060
What about the other one?

701
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,180
It was sent to the gallery.

702
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,710
I have the good taste.

703
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,380
Master,

704
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,920
we asked Jia

705
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,470
to open an online shop to sell paintings,

706
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,700
it would affect the future of a great painter.

707
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,490
Dawei.

708
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,740
Alright, stop it.

709
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,340
Dawei,

710
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,940
you can't spend the Spring Festival with your mom.

711
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,300
Is that okay?

712
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,060
Yes.

713
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,020
You don't know.

714
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,380
Xia Jie's mom and my mom

715
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,210
are going to be the rotten ginger that can't be broken.

716
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,580
They are together every day.

717
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,420
They quarrel every day.

718
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,370
They can't live without each other.

719
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,900
They must be together during the Spring Festival.

720
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,020
Jia, what about you?

721
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,620
Your sister Xia Jie

722
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,780
must be celebrating the Spring Festival with them.

723
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,820
Why don't you join them?

724
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,100
Sure.

725
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,700
Then I'll spend with Xia Jie.

726
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,100
-Okay. -I'll spend with Xia Jie.

727
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,860
OK. My mom will have one more daughter.

728
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,260
She is my daughter.

729
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,900
Give it to me.

730
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,530
Okay.

731
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,370
Have you brought enough clothes?

732
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,210
-Yes. -I'm almost finished.

733
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:24,900
Are you okay in this?

734
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,540
Fine.

735
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,620
By the way,

736
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,770
Jia,

737
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,250
you must close the door

738
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:29,860
every night.

739
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,730
And check the gas.

740
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,500
Got it.

741
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,540
When you're free,

742
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,860
remember to call your mom

743
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,150
during the Spring Festival, okay?

744
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,500
Okay, don't come out.

745
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,920
Tell me what you want to eat.

746
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,120
I'll bring for you from the Northeast of China.

747
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,140
Enough. Stop mumbling.

748
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,860
I heard it.

749
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,140
Bye.

750
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,530
Bye. Dad, be careful.

751
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,170
Okay.

752
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,990
Cooperate with

753
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,180
the Qibei police

754
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,720
and get their support.

755
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Stay alert.

756
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,860
You must have enough police.

757
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,620
Don't take the risk.

758
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,220
Du, drive slowly.

759
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:01,970
OK.

760
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,220
-I'm leaving. -Be careful.

761
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,340
Drive slowly.

762
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,980
Be careful.

763
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:21,940
Here.

764
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:22,930
Okay.

765
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,530
Come in.

766
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,120
Okay.

767
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,380
Okay.

768
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,460
OK.

769
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,620
You two take a rest here.

770
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,730
I'll go get the chief.

771
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,570
Okay.

772
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,610
Have a seat.

773
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,060
Master,

774
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,100
this place is really exciting.

775
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,090
The inside and outside are really different.

776
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,100
Dawei.

777
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,140
Yue Wei

778
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,100
was at your age back then.

779
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,300
If you have been living in this kind of place,

780
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,050
what would you think all day long?

781
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,300
It depends if he went out or not,

782
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,980
whether he had seen the outside world.

783
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,490
If not,

784
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,760
it's a good job

785
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,790
to be an auxiliary police here.

786
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,180
But if he had seen,

787
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,260
it's not sure.

788
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,140
Officer Chen.

789
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,940
This is our deputy chief, Chief Niu.

790
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,780
Hello, Chief Niu.

791
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,650
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

792
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,260
Happy New Year.

793
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,660
The chief is having a meeting in the city.

794
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,660
It's snowy.

795
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,700
I don't think he'll be back tomorrow.

796
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,830
Chief Niu, look.

797
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,580
Sorry to have troubled you during the Spring Festival.

798
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,680
What are you talking about?

799
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,260
You come here to work on a case during the Spring Festival.

800
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,050
You've worked hard.

801
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,220
But

802
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,570
I'm afraid I can't help you.

803
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,380
What do you mean?

804
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,980
We checked the person you mentioned.

805
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,730
He did work here for three years.

806
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,190
But it's been fifteen or sixteen years since he left here.

807
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,300
It's been too long.

808
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,900
Almost no one in the station knows him.

809
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,180
That's impossible.

810
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,239
People who was a policeman 15 or 16 years ago

811
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,380
is only in his 40s now.

812
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,780
You don't know.

813
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,260
It's called a police station here.

814
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,330
There are only five or six people.

815
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,610
Look at our conditions.

816
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,290
Especially after cutting trees was not allowed in the zone,

817
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,260
there are few people.

818
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,219
There's not much work.

819
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,929
Young people don't want to work here.

820
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,780
Old comrades

821
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,929
want to transfer to the city.

822
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,300
There's a large personnel mobility.

823
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,020
People who worked here 15 or 16 years ago

824
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,130
couldn't be found now.

825
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,300
They are everywhere.

826
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,739
I see.

827
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,130
But our former chief

828
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,100
retired here.

829
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,460
When we chatted,

830
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,300
we asked about that person.

831
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
He remembers vaguely.

832
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,179
-If you're interested... -Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

833
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,659
Can we see him?

834
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,900
Ma, contact Chief Zhou.

835
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,650
Okay. Okay.

836
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,980
Thank you, Chief Niu. Thank you.

837
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,820
It's land on my feet.

838
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,219
[Taling Station of Qibei Public Security Bureau]

839
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,500
The residential area you mentioned

840
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,100
is a bit complicated.

841
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,580
Go ahead.

842
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,460
The main ingredients of the residents

843
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,420
are farmers from three surrounding villages.

844
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,540
They moved in for non-agricultural.

845
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,740
It's a

846
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,420
converted community.

847
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,860
Two months ago,

848
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,980
they had been making a scene

849
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,040
and there were two armed battles.

850
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,210
It took us a lot of effort

851
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,580
to calm down.

852
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,500
Today is the 29th day of the lunar year.

853
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,060
Tomorrow is the 30th.

854
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,700
At this sensitive moment,

855
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,250
if the police go in and look for people,

856
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,330
there might be unnecessary misunderstandings.

857
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,780
If something happens,

858
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,460
we can't even celebrate this year well.

859
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,300
So our bureau discussed it.

860
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,540
We hope solve it after the Spring Festival.

861
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,300
First of all, thank you, Chief Liu,

862
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,660
for giving us such detailed explanation.

863
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,170
We understand what you said.

864
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,830
But look,

865
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,010
we came all the way here.

866
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,220
How about this?

867
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,660
we change into plain clothes

868
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,820
and go in quietly to have a look.

869
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,540
Because we have his photos.

870
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,170
The characteristic of the car is also obvious.

871
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,340
It won't be hard to find it.

872
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,980
Zhang,

873
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,690
normally,

874
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,820
you can go in and find it if you want.

875
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,380
What time is it now?

876
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,220
It's the Spring Festival.

877
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,260
Everyone has gone home for it.

878
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,980
Some foreigners in plain clothes

879
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,500
come to the community

880
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,660
for no reason.

881
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,500
It's hard not to draw others' attention.

882
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,250
So,

883
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,630
our opinion

884
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,500
is to wait until after the Spring Festival.

885
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,770
Brother,

886
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,460
your working conditions are really hard.

887
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,180
Is it hard?

888
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,090
Much better than the people.

889
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,700
All would envy

890
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:52,980
the one who become the police.

891
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,460
Did you graduate from the police academy?

892
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,550
No.

893
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,500
I'm an auxiliary police.

894
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,460
My dad was a policeman.

895
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,660
He got injured later.

896
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,980
I was taken care of to join the police.

897
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,180
But I'm thinking of getting into the police academy.

898
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,320
So,

899
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,060
aren't you going to

900
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,490
work here for a long time?

901
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,760
It's so frustrating to stay here.

902
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,790
There are fewer and fewer people here.

903
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,950
Sometimes I'm scared of

904
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,060
on night duty alone.

905
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,140
Ma.

906
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,100
Is here

907
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,580
always so deserted?

908
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,980
Of course not.

909
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,580
It turns out that our forest area is very lively.

910
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,820
People are here to cut trees,

911
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,060
processing and transport wood.

912
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,900
But after the mountain was sealed

913
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,500
and stopped cutting.

914
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,140
The forestry workers became forestry protectors.

915
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,620
There's no need so many people.

916
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,330
It's getting more deserted.

917
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,740
How many years has it been?

918
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,270
It was lively here when I was young.

919
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,020
But after I went to school,

920
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,300
it's getting worse.

921
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,500
We're almost there.

922
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
It's the village ahead.

923
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,670
Ma.

924
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,390
Stop the car for me

925
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,540
when pass by the supermarket or shop later.

926
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,080
Okay.

927
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:56,740
Master.

928
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
Are we going back like this?

929
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,220
Of course not.

930
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,880
We finally got here.

931
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,620
If he run after the Spring Festival,

932
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,970
where can we chase him?

933
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,500
Let's find a place to stay first.

934
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:08,820
Du,

935
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,790
check if there is a hotel ahead.

936
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,440
Okay.

937
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,250
Chief Zhou.

938
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,660
Chief Zhou.

939
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,980
Alright, stop calling.

940
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,210
This is the two comrades from Pingling

941
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,290
I told you in the call.

942
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,170
Hello, Chief Zhou.

943
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,330
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

944
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,880
I'm Chen, Chen Xincheng.

945
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,460
OK.

946
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,990
Hello, Chief Zhou.

947
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,090
My name is Li Dawei.

948
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,900
I'm his apprentice.

949
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,610
His apprentice.

950
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,950
Just come.

951
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,770
Why are you buying for me?

952
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,600
It's the Spring Festival.

953
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,100
Hurry up.

954
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,390
It's warm inside. Come in.

955
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,720
Chief Zhou, you have a talk first.

956
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,550
I won't come in.

957
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,890
Officer Chen, I'll pick you up tonight.

958
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,730
Okay.

959
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,750
Okay. Thank you, Officer Chen.

960
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,450
You're welcome.

961
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,400
No.

962
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,340
Come on. Come in. It's warm inside.

963
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,690
-No, I have something to do in the station. -Please come in first.

964
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,190
Okay.

965
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,300
Honey, come here.

966
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,230
Take the things over.

967
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,150
-Come in. Come in.-Okay.

968
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,050
It's so warm inside.

969
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,850
Here, kid.

970
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,680
Take off your shoes and get on the bed.

971
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,490
It's warm there.

972
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,510
Chief Zhou,

973
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,140
here's really interesting.

974
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,930
It was just four o'clock this afternoon

975
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,820
and it's already dark.

976
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,500
That's all here.

977
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,290
It's so hot.

978
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,760
It gets dark quickly and lights up quickly.

979
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,700
Really?

980
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,610
Let me do it.

981
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,730
You just talk to them.

982
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,740
Coming.

983
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,300
Here.

984
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,450
Here's the noodles. Be careful not to get burned.

985
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,290
Thank you. Thank you.

986
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,040
And more?

987
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,820
Come on, brothers.

988
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,460
You go first.

989
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,400
Hurry up.

990
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,670
Turn around slowly. Don't get burned.

991
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,840
Come on, guys.

992
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,570
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

993
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,900
I'll treat you to full. Just eat as much as you can.

994
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,050
You two serve first. You two serve first.

995
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,930
Eat up. Eat up.

996
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,220
I'm curious.

997
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,110
Every time I go on a business trip,

998
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,300
I feel that the food outside

999
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,650
tastes very good.

1000
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,500
Then eat more.

1001
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
You won't miss home when you're full.

1002
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,010
I shouldn't have said that.

1003
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,290
Are you homesick?

1004
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,450
I'm not homesick anyway.

1005
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,620
I'm alone

1006
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,900
at the station anyway.

1007
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,860
I can't go home.

1008
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,380
I don't miss home anyway.

1009
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,780
If I don't go on a business trip,

1010
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,380
I'm cleaning

1011
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,140
in my mother-in-law's house now.

1012
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,020
My wife always says

1013
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
I'm usually not at home.

1014
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,580
I couldn't take care for her family matters.

1015
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,890
In the Spring Festival I'm on leave,

1016
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,420
I should perform well.

1017
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,970
I don't miss too.

1018
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,740
My mother-in-law isn't here.

1019
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,900
I don't do housework either.

1020
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,300
But I can't escape

1021
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,580
from the cleaning in the days before the year.

1022
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,580
This time I would go on a business trip,

1023
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,540
my wife said,

1024
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,300
see, he's a deserter again.

1025
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,480
Look at you.

1026
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,860
You are independent to be the police.

1027
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,410
All you know is the group,

1028
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,370
not family.

1029
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,820
I'm different from you.

1030
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,100
I'm homesick.

1031
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,180
I just want to finish the case quickly

1032
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,770
then go home and have fun.

1033
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,940
Eat up.

1034
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,260
Let's go there after eating.

1035
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,500
What if we run into him or the car?

1036
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,970
If we finish the mission in advance,

1037
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,400
we can take him back for the Spring Festival.

1038
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,220
Eat up. Eat more.

1039
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,800
Eat while it's hot. Come on.

1040
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,510
Sister, sit here and eat together.

1041
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,470
You eat first.

1042
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,140
Chief Zhou, from what you said,

1043
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,900
you valued Yue Wei so much back then.

1044
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,310
If he continued to work in the police station,

1045
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,850
he would have had a bright future.

1046
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,370
Then why did he leave?

1047
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,420
I don't know.

1048
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,750
That kid is not like you.

1049
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,850
He

1050
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,090
is a person who can't see the bottom at a glance.

1051
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,260
I took him out a few times

1052
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,900
because of the cases.

1053
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
I thought

1054
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,020
maybe

1055
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
he's knowledgeable

1056
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,530
and become wild.

1057
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,900
He wants to go out and make a career.

1058
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,420
That's possible.

1059
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,830
I've retired before he left.

1060
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,740
Chief, this year you...

1061
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,010
Seventy years old.

1062
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,380
Chief Zhou,

1063
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,050
if you're 70 years old this year,

1064
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,500
then 15 or 16 years ago,

1065
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,940
you shouldn't be the age of retirement.

1066
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,380
At that time,

1067
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,540
something happened in the station,

1068
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,990
so I retired early.

1069
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,890
What is it?

1070
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,170
Well, come on, eat more.

1071
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,930
Eat while it's hot. Eat while it's hot.
