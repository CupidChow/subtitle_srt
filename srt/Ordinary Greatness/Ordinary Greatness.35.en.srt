5
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,020
I am thinking

6
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,820
how malicious

7
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,780
the world is.

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,280
He had deprived Wu Yu of all of her money.

9
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,380
That was a large sum of money.

10
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,780
But before he left,

11
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,539
he still borrowed a large sum from loan sharks

12
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,979
for Wu Yu to repay.

13
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,820
For a girl

14
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,860
who had infinite trust

15
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,260
in him,

16
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,890
didn't he have any sympathy?

17
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,960
This is the characteristic of internet fraud.

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,030
During the Holocaust,

19
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,940
the Nazi Germany also thought of many ways

20
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,740
to stop the murderers

21
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,579
from feeling guilty.

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,620
Besides brainwashing them,

23
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,100
most importantly,

24
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,340
they wanted to normalize murdering

25
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,180
as a routine job.

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
The victims

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,100
were objectified.

28
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,260
In other words,

29
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,180
the murderers were persecuting objects instead of people.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,620
Their daily job was not murdering.

31
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,180
Just like ordinary people,

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,960
they went to work

33
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,740
to kill some pests.

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,820
Then they got off work and went home.

35
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,400
At home, those murderers

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,079
were all breadwinners,

37
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,260
who acted as kind and responsible fathers.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,980
Every morning,

39
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,620
he would gently tell his wife and kids

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,540
that he was leaving for work.

41
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,500
He would tell his kids to be good.

42
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,500
Then he went to work.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,980
What did he do at work? Murdering.

44
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,890
They had no moral feelings of guilt.

45
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,330
That was horrific.

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,650
This is the same for pig-butchering scams.

47
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,320
Think about it.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,220
The Internet separated the scammers and victims.

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,320
What does a scammer do at work?

50
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,110
Scam.

51
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,710
The victims

52
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
were already objectified into pigs.

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,780
For scammers,

54
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,730
the more money they tricked out of the victims,

55
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,780
the higher their KPIs were.

56
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,340
So they wouldn't feel guilty at all.

57
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,540
That's why

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,660
we must

59

arrest all the scammers,

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,300
and bring them to Wu Yu.

61
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,579
They must face

62
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,260
the victim themselves

63
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
so that the victim

64
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,800
can pull herself together again.

in this case.

72
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,740
Bring them to Wu Yu.

73
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,300
They must be punished by law.

74
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,260
Yes sir.

75
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,160
All of these websites were forged?

76
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,500
Yes, all forged.

77
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,540
When Wu Yu scanned the QR code,

78
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,990
she had entered into a website

79
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,940

Okay. Forget about these websites.

went into this account,

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,630
it would flow into an overseas cash pool.

00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,020
we can't look into it after this stage.

100

we aren't able to trace the money.

Money came in.

104
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,900
It went into another cash pool through the pipe,

105
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,540
like water flowing through a water pipe,

106

and then into a reservoir.

Even if all the water in the reservoir was drained,

108
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,020
you wouldn't be sure

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,020
which part of the water

110
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,340
came from her account.

See.

112
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,580
There's only 2.5 left in her account.

113
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,100

as soon as money came in,

115
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,700
they would immediately transfer it.

116
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,380
They would transfer it into another cash pool.

117

The money may be transferred from the cash pool again.

After several transfers,

119

the money would completely disappear.

No wonder

123
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,370
it's more difficult to solve telecoms frauds.

besides the money they spent,

127
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,540
we could return the rest to the victim.

128
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,370
The criminals would be punished according to the law.

how's the victim doing?

133
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,580
The instructor said she looked quite calm.

134
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,580
She barely talked nor ate.

135
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,180
This is the most worrying situation.

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
She still has her mother by her side.

137

Chief Gao,

138
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,610
it doesn't matter if we can get the money back.

139
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,340
Arresting the scammer

140
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,500
is very important

141
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
to the victim.

142
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,140
Now since we can't count on the cash flow,

143
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,820
let's arrest the criminal first.

144
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,740
Okay.

145
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,020
I see.

146
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,580
Since the cash flow didn't work out,

147
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,590
let's work on the information flow.

148
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,620
Start from the scammers on the Internet.

149
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,900
Let's start from the Internet.

150
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,870
I'm so hungry.

151
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,980
So selfish of you eating noodles alone.

152
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,780
It's suffocating.

153
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,740
I just took a bite.

154
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,300
Eat mine if you don't mind. I'll cook.

155
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,810
Okay.

156
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,330
The fraud case

157
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,370
had obstacles everywhere.

158
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,850
Today we finally made some progress.

159
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,380
You caught the scammer?

160
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,940
Dawei, you are not selfish.

161
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,790
Give me some.

162
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,700
Give me some.

163
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,410
I...

164
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,250
Let me eat first.

165
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,890
I'm asking you. Did you find the scammer?

166
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,000
Not really.

167
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,460
Now we know

168
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,100
he used other's information to register.

169
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,700
But we can confirm

170
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,340
the scammer is in Haiming county.

171
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,660
We've contacted the local police for assistance in investigation.

172
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,500
The local police is cooperating with us.

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,420
I believe the case

174
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,700
can be cracked soon.

175
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,930
This afternoon,

176
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,620
I visited the hospital with my master.

177
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,620
The victim

178
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,540
was still feeling miserable.

179
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,030
It occurred to me

180
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,540
that being a police officer is really meaningful.

181
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,850
Without the police,

182
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,100
who could the victims ask for help from?

183
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,130
Zhao Jiwei, why didn't you leave some for me?

184
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,010
Didn't you say you were going to cook noodles?

185
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,980
Why are you sitting here?

186
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm listening to you.

187
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,860
It's pleasant to listen to me.

188
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,700
Why are you so cheeky?

189
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,680
Xia Jie meant you two.

190
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,520
Zhao Jiwei.

191
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,980
A sensible man

192
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,340
would treat himself as air.

193
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,560
Li Dawei.

194
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,660
You are sensible.

195
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,060
Why don't you treat yourself as air?

196
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,300
You're in a good mood today.

197
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,620
Did anything happen?

198
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,100
Yeah. Tell us about it.

199
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,170
Nothing specific.

200
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,150
I'm just happy.

201
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,820
Have you adapted to the Household Registration Department?

202
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,299
Not totally.

203
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,659
I used to think, like you guys,

204
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,000
being on duty and solving emergencies

205
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
and the tension were meaningful.

206
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,460
Now I think

207
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,880
it's also meaningful to work at the Household Registration Department.

208
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,700
Good.

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,670
I'll cook noodles for you.

210
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,780
Me too.

211
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,450
Why are you blocking me?

212
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,750
Scan the code.

213
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,180
What code?

214
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,220
Cooking noodles so you aren't scanning it.

215
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,890
Not yet. I'm hungry. Eat...

216
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,020
You just...

217
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,700
I'm not hungry?

218
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,460
My job. Go away.

219
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,580
From the information flow, we can confirm

220
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,820
that the scammers are located

221
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,740
in Haiming county.

222
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,140
It's not hard to understand

223
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,300
why they chose this place.

224
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,580
Because Haiming county

225
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,100
is at the border of Southeast Asia.

226
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,220
If anything happens,

227
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,700
they can flee abroad anytime.

228
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,190
We suspect

229
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
that the scammers

230
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,860
have colluded with foreign powers.

231
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,980
After tracing to this point,

232
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,740
the clue was blocked.

233
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,020
Because in Haiming county

234
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,940
there are more than two million people.

235
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,100
The population of permanent residents is more than one million.

236
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,140
The area is not small.

237
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,260
The Public Security Bureau of Haiming County said

238
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,060
if we didn't provide more accurate information,

239
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,620
they would be not able to locate them properly.

240
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,950
Don't we have

241
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,740
the identity information of the scammer?

242
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,060
It's fake.

243
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,140
That Tian Gaoping

244
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,540
died two years ago.

245
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,500
The scammer only

246
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,100
stole his QQ account.

247
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,510
Up to this point,

248
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,830
we have lost

249
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,000
all the clues of the scammer.

250
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
We've lost him.

251
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,660
Anyway, this is the end of the clue.

252
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,140
No way.

253

The victim

254
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,640
is still lying in the hospital.

255
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,380
We can't say we've lost the clue,

256
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,620
and give her the runaround.

257

I require

258

whatever it takes,

259
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,340
wherever you go,

260
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,300
you have to capture the scammer.

261
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,870
Yes.

262
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,700
I know it won't work.

263
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,300
We're

264
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,660
now opening our minds and expanding the leads.

265
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,980
So we...

266

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,700
Chief, Jiwei and I thought about it.

269
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
We think

270
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,450
there's a way.

271
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,460
What way?

272
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,820
Wu Yu met the scammer

273
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,930
through the website Long Distance Romance.

274
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,820

using online dating sites to find victims

is one of the most common ways of the fraudulent group.

278
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,750

Why?

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,990
We analyzed that he was probably afraid of

344
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,100
messing up a sure thing,

345
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,890
so he didn't wait for the demolition compensation.

346
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,420
He told Mrs. Fan in advance

347
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,530
that he was dead.

348
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,910
Based on the situation above,

349
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,900
we wondered,

350
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,040
would it be possible...

351
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,570
What possible?

352
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,660
Don't stammer.

353
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,660
Say it.

354
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,900
Let's show the slides.

355
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,900
We thought,

356
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,900
would it be possible

357
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,820
if we pretended to be Mrs. Fan,

358
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,250
and sent a message to the scammer.

359
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,580
We would write,

360
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,160
[Fan Wenxiu chat log]

361
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,210
"Sister, don't blame it on yourself.

362
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,060
Life and wealth are up to the fate.

363
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,480
Your brother also didn't want

364
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,230
things like this to happen.

365
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,320
Luckily, the demolition project

366
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,630
suddenly is about to start.

367
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,970
I heard that I'd get over 6 million in compensation.

368
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,940
It can totally cover the previous loss.

369
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,450
So,

370
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,300
you don't need to worry about it."

371
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,460
You brat

372
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,660
must stay on the right track.

373
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,380
This was our idea.

374
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,560
Chief, is it okay?

375
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,860
Go for it.

376
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,710
You're still awake in the middle of the night.

377
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,540
What are you doing?

378
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,200
Come on. Sit down.

379
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,340
Let me read it for you.

380
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,700
Start from the first line.

381
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,290
"Madam, I'm so sorry.

382
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,870
I didn't notice your message until now.

383
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,180
Too many things have happened these days.

384
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,570
Our whole family has been in a mess.

385
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,380
Madam,

386
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,490
do you believe in coming back to life?

387
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,740
This happened in my family.

388
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,790
To put it simply,

389
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,020
three days after my brother was buried,

390
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,940
he came back to life."

391
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,940
What the heck?

392
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,140
The second one.

393
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,020
"Madam, we have a custom

394
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,490
of burning paper for the dead after burial.

395
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,260
This morning,

396
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,300
when I burnt paper for my brother,

397
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,020
I heard a noise in the grave.

398
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,420
I was terrified.

399
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,370
When I listened carefully,

400
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,250
it was my brother's voice.

401
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,090
He asked

402
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,140
what time it was. Was it dawn?

403
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,980
I rushed home to ask for help to dig the grave.

404
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,020
When the coffin was opened,

405
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,250
my brother sat up from the coffin.

406
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,140
He was alive.

407
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,580
He said he was hungry.

408
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,980
He said he wanted porridge."

409
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,340
What? My goodness.

410
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,230
Shouldn't he ask about Mrs. Fan?

411
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,100
Don't rush.

412
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,060
It's in the next line.

413
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,050
"Madam,

414
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,030
his second sentence was about you.

415
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,210
He said he felt sorry

416
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,020
for losing your money in the investment.

417
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,020
During his long nap,

418
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,460
he had a few dreams.

419
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,500
In his dreams,

420
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,260
he was thinking how to make up for your loss,

421
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,340
and get the money back.

422
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,780
He said he already found a way.

423
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,620
Madam, my brother is very serious about you.

424
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,100
As his sister, I'm even a bit jealous."

425
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,860
I'm jealous too.

426
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,420
"Madam, I showed

427
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,540
your text to my brother.

428
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,860
My brother is still feeling weak,

429
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,260
so he can't reply to you in person.

430
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,620
He wanted me to tell you

431
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,220
your demolition compensation belongs to you.

432
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,550
Don't give it to anyone.

433
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,390
He will definitely make up for

434
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,730
all the losses in the investment."

435
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,140
See.

436
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,880
These sentences

437
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,260
make people feel so touched.

438
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,170
How should I reply to him?

439
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,660
I'll write,

440
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,470
"Take care of yourself. We have a long way to go."

441
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,290
What's wrong with you?

442
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
What time is it?

443
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,100
In the middle of the night.

444
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,290
Do you think it's appropriate?

445
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,780
What should we do?

446
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,420
I...

447
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,900
I have to wait for a few hours to reply to him.

448
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,860
I can't wait.

449
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,580
These scammers

450
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,400
won't give up until they reach their goals.

451
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,340
They won't stop

452
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,100
until they drain every drop of your blood.

453
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,780
Chief Gao, you should plan it well.

454
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,020
Don't rush and startle the scammers.

455
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,140
Okay. Don't worry.

456
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,090
He came to life because of the demolition compensation.

457
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,090
Maybe we can use it as a bait?

458
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,340
No way.

459
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,620
If he was reborn,

460
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,460
and Mrs. Fan didn't suspect anything,

461
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,490
it may sound too foolish.

462
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,460
The scammer might be suspicious.

463
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
In my opinion,

464
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,660
let's be suspicious of

465
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,250
his return to life,

466
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,780
and ask him to prove himself.

467
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,660
What do you think?

468
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,339
It's risky.

469
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,849
He might not show up.

470
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,569
We only ask questions.

471
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,740
The scammer needs to figure it out himself.

472
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,340
I think we can give it a try.

473
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,740
"Are you really Tong Lei?

474
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,080
Are you really alive?

475
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,220
Where are you?

476
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,370
How's everything?

477
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,070
I want to see you, okay?"

478
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,580
Just like this.

479
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,660
"Don't come here.

480
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,780
I don't want you to see

481
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,940
me like a living dead person.

482
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,020
Honey,

483
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,140
if love between both sides can last for aye,

484
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,820
why do they need to stay together night and day?

485
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,390
I need to recover,

486
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,470
and make up for your losses I made.

487
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,620
I want to show up to you

488
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,820
in the best way possible.

489
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,870
Honey,

490
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,960
it won't be long before that day arrives."

491
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,150
Applause. It's well written.

492
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,630
Thank you. Thank you.

493
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,900
"I can get off bed today.

494
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,820
My legs are a bit weak.

495
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,510
When I took the first step

496
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,740
with my sister's help,

497
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,330
I thought it was great to be alive."

"Honey, don't worry.

I will find my uncle in Macau,

and get your money back."

"Honey,

503

I took this from the window of the hospital ward."

504
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,730
We have a clue.

505
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,500
Good. Inform the police in Haiming county.

506

With this video,

they are able to locate them exactly.

After receiving your video

and other clues,

510
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,300
we used technology

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,920
I agree.

682
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,780
But now,

683
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,070
the handover is a bit difficult.

684
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,420
Haiming Police won't let them go.

685
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,620
It must be difficult.

686
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,260
You should work with Chief Gao.

687
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,450
Yes sir.

688
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,970
We'll try our best

689
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,710
to bring the suspects back as soon as possible.

690
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,620
Good.

691
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,180
Dawei, take care!

692
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,410
Got it.

693
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,650
Chief Gao.

694
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,330
Officer Zhao.

695
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,020
Officer Zhao.

696
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,120
I just told you.

697
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,100
You all saw it.

698
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,780
We only froze

699
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,420
the scam money they got yesterday,

700
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,970
which they didn't transfer in time.

701
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,380
Just over a million.

702
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,650
To find out how much they stole,

703
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,340
it might take a long time.

704
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
I suppose the one million

705
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,020
is just a tip of the iceberg.

706
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,340
I understand, Officer Zhao.

707
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,500
It is impossible

708
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,340
to fully recover the stolen funds.

709
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,060
But we must do our best.

710
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,500
There are two victims,

711
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,780
who are on the verge of suicide.

712
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,180
So I hope

713
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,120
we can redeem their losses a bit more

714
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,590
in order to rebuild their

715
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,010
courage to live.

716
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
I'm sorry, Chief Gao.

717
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,180
Until the case investigation is completed,

718
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,580
no one is allowed to access the stolen funds.

719
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,340
Not only your victims have committed suicide.

720
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,820
It's the same for our victims.

721
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,500
So please understand.

722
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,260
I totally understand.

723
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,770
Can we escort

724
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,820
the two suspects

725
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,620
who are directly linked to our victims?

726
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,440
I'm sorry. This won't do either.

727
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,540
Officer Zhao, don't refuse right away.

728
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,670
I know.

729
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,580
Victims have attempted to commit suicide

730
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,570
after being cheated.

731
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,660
It didn't happen only with ours.

732
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,660
This is a challenge posed to the police.

733
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,260
Are we able to be in victims' shoes

734
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,180
thinking from their perspectives?

735
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,460
Please understand.

736
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,340
Officer Zhao.

737
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,020
After the arrest,

738
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,790
I called our station.

739
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,660
They told me,

740
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,490
one of our victims

741
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,500
attempted suicide again in the hospital.

742
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,780
I know

743
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,060
our request is a bit too much.

744
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,780
We aren't following the rules.

745
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,100
But it's a matter of life and death.

746
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,100
We can talk about the rules.

747
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,940
Officer Zhao, it's serious.

748
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,140
If we can escort the suspect back,

749
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,660
we may be able to save a life.

750
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Let me ask for permission.

751
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,020
Thank you.

752
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,300
Thank you.

753
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,500
-Instructor. -You're heading out.

754
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,360
Instructor.

755
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,880
Instructor.

756
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,500
Instructor.

757
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,210
Instructor! Instructor! Instructor!

758
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,020
What's the matter?

759
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,250
I was catching up with you.

760
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,570
What's the matter, chief?

761
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,060
You look so excited.

762
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
I am excited.

763
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,890
We arrested all members in the fraudulent group.

764
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,560
Last night, Gao Chao called.

765
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,070
He said after negotiating with

766
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,860
Haiming Police,

767
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,740
they would escort the two suspects back tomorrow morning.

768
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,570
Great! That's great!

769
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,940
Yes indeed.

770
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,520
By the way,

771
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,270
I have better news.

772
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,020
You visit the hospital now,

773
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,460
and tell Wu Yu the good news.

774
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,620
Tell her

775
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,940
once the suspects are back,

776
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,220
they will be taken

777
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,300
to apologize to her.

778
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,420
Chief.

779
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,410
Can you ask others to do it?

780
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,820
Why?

781
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,420
Actually,

782
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,620
I visited the hospital yesterday.

783
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,620
I really don't know

784
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,340
how to counsel this girl.

785
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,300
You...

786
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,020
I...

787
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,100
What happened?

788
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,340
I can't find a way.

789
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,370
You can't find a way?

790
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,900
There's a way now.

791
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,730
You used to

792
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,100
just console her with words.

793
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,050
But now?

794
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,980
We have good news. We arrested them.

795
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,860
Tell her the good news

796
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,460
to rebuild her confidence in life.

797
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,420
Xia Jie. Xia Jie.

798
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,300
Come here. Come here.

799
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,500
Yes, chief?

800
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,120
Well,

801
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,720
you'd better go to the hospital with the instructor.

802
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,100
You don't feel well, instructor?

803
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,740
No.

804
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,660
The chief wanted us to go to the hospital

805
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,060
to console Wu Yu,

806
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,180
and tell her

807
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,700
the suspects have been arrested.

808
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,140
But I have work to do at the Household Registration Center.

809
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,580
It's just for a short while.

810
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,300
Li Daiwei and Zhao Jiwei

811
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,410
tricked the scammer.

812
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,040
You know about this.

813
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,340
You should

814
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,820
tell her

815
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,580
like telling a story.

816
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,100
Hope can be rebuilt when it is lost.

817
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,500
Just go.

818
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,820
I'll go get changed.

819
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,600
I'll be right down.

820
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,530
I'll send a document first.

821
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,260
Off you go.

822
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,930
A person lost faith in life,

823
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,500
and completely lost faith in herself.

824
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,810
How can we give counseling to her

825
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,620
so that she'll regain

826
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,780
the courage in life?

827
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,020
The people who hurt her got arrested.

828
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,940
It should be a consolation.

829
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,980
I don't know.

830
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,540
Instructor.

831
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,500
From what you said,

832
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
I think if Wu Yu had known the scammers were arrested,

833
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,620
she would feel relieved.

834
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,700
But I suppose

835
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,870
it's only temporary relief.

836
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,140
Because the scammer not only tricked her for her money

837
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,700
but also devastated her courage to live.

838
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,460
In this situation,

839
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,710
I think the psychologist must intervene in it.

840
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,620
Did I say something wrong?

841
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,290
No.

842
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,900
Then...

843
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,540
I just thought

844
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,220
after you joined the Household Registration Department,

845
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,580
you completely changed.

846
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,140
Really?

847
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,020
Of course.

848
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,940
We're almost there.

849
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,460
When you meet Wu Yu,

850
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,610
you should talk more and give her some advice.

851
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,600
Okay.

852
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,630
The Inpatient Department is over there.

853
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,340
Talk to her.

854
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
-Give her some advice. -Okay.

855
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,300
What's wrong?

856
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,960
Wu Yu!

857
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,250
Excuse me. Excuse me.

858
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,380
Wu Yu! Wu Yu! Wu Yu!

859
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,900
Don't do anything stupid!

860
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,450
Don't jump.

861
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,830
I'm telling you. The scammers were caught.

862
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,780
I'll make the call.

863
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,860
Don't jump!

864
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,400
Don't jump!

865
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,320
Call the police!

866
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,390
Li Dawei.

867
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,540
It's so cold in the middle of the night.

868
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,120
Why are you sitting here?

869
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
It's stuffy in the room.

870
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,210
I came out for some fresh air.

871
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,610
Why are you sitting down?

872
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:08,890
For...

873
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,060
I've been sitting with you at the hospital for a long time.

874
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,060
Let's go.

875
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,500
What are you doing here?

876
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,900
Are you going to keep watch in the yard?

877
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,220
Dawei,

878
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,740
I already told you.

879
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,500
We tried our best.

880
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,030
It was not our fault.

881
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,090
I know it wasn't our fault.

882
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,560
I didn't think it was our fault.

883
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,580
I was just thinking

884
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,500
we had done our best,

885
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,210
and yet we still couldn't do anything.

886
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,230
I saw Wu Yu jumping off the building.

887
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,500
It was really close.

888
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,020
It was right

889
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,500
in front of my eyes.

890
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,010
I can't describe what I had felt.

891
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,380
But this time,

892
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,930
it was different from Dr. Zhuo.

893
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,820
I wasn't that scared.

894
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,620
On the contrary, I thought

895
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,040
it was something I must go through.

896
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,310
I just asked myself

897
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,460
if I still wanted to be a police officer.

898
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,980
The answer is yes.

899
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,080
I think,

900
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,820
that moment

901
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,530
reminded me of Dr. Zhuo.

902
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,530
When I saw Dr. Zhuo's body

903
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,980
with a dozen of wounds,

904
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,150
I felt helpless.

905
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,800
Scammers emerge everyday.

906
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,280
Crimes happen everyday.

907
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,890
It is almost impossible

908
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,110
for the police

909
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,560
to stop all crimes.

910
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,690
What is the meaning

911
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,050
to be a police officer?

912
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,260
Last night,

913
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,580
when knowing the suspects were arrested,

914
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,460
Mrs. Fan, the victim

915
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,820
called me.

916
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,680
She said

917
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,480
she was forgiven by her daughter and son-in-law.

918
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,780
She would go on with her life.

919
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,100
I think

920
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,700
this is the meaning of our work.

921
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,260
We may neither be able to eradicate crimes

922
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,810
nor to protect everyone,

923
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,300
but with the police,

924
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,770
the defense of the society exists.

925
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,760
There are kindness and justice.

926
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,090
For those who were rescued,

927
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,320
the police's work has been very meaningful.

928
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,830
Regarding the anti-fraud,

929
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,340
Gao Chao, the floor is yours.

930
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,880
Comrades, I have something to say.

931
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,350
About the anti-fraud operation,

932
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,540
the station believes it is

933
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,510
as important as combating crimes.

934
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,450
Prevention always matters more than intervention.

935
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:15,990
Our station

936
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,140
has made a booklet on anti-telecoms frauds.

937
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,450
Recently,

938
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,950
we will invite some experts

939
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,070
to give lessons to the citizens in our community.

940
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,980
After the meeting,

941
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,020
all teams should collect these booklets.

942
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,620
Requirements.

943
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,540
Remember the requirements.

944
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,930
Distribute them to all the neighborhoods

945
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,920
and every residents.

946
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,860
Educate all the residents

947
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,520
on anti-fraud issues.

948
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,700
Are you clear?

949
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,460
Yes sir.

950
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,740
And also, our station has decided

951
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,340
to include the anti-fraud operation

952
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,180
to our routine work.

953
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,660
We must persist with this work.

954
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,780
Do you have the confidence?

955
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,650
Yes!

956
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:53,890
That's all.

957
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,040
Okay. Dismissed.

958
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,710
Madam.

959
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,770
Yang Shu,

960
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,730
why are you here?

961
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,240
My master is getting out today.

962
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,010
I'm here to welcome him back.

963
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,140
You're the only one who remembers him.

964
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,940
No, madam.

965
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,110
The chief called to remind me to come.

966
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,880
He wanted to come,

967
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,520
but he was too busy at the station.

968
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,620
He had no choice.

969
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,290
I understand.
