00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,340
Hello, mom.

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,140
Jie,

7
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,330
why didn't you answer my call earlier?

8
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,810
I was so worried.

9
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,460
Mom, I'm a little busy today,

10
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,020
but I still have a sense of achievement.

11
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
Stop it.

12
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,860
I've called Wang Shouyi

13
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,940
and Ye Wei.

14
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,980
Why didn't you come back yet?

15
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,540
Mom, why did you call my boss again?

16
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,580
If I didn't,

17
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,330
I wouldn't have known that

18
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,419
you had suffered so much outside.

19
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,660
You come back quickly.

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,220
We quit the job.

21
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,380
We will not work at Balihe Police Station anymore.

22
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,300
I'll call the director now.

23
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,579
No, Mom.

24
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,180
Hello?

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,970
Master.

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,110
Master!

Jie.

30
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,250
You lost your dad.

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,340
Your mom called us this morning.

32
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,140
She asked us to take good care of you.

33
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,920
Do we need her to call us?

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,740
Why did she make this call?

35
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,740
If she didn't call us,

36
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,450
we would also take good care of you.

Let me see. So handsome.

It's your first day for working, but you are busy with working all day.

Big handsome guy. You've had a long day.

Service for the people.

60
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,700
Mom, I'll go to change my clothes.

61
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,540
Go.

Mom, what's wrong?

65
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,820
I'm not feeling well.

66
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,450
I have no appetite.

67
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,780
Did you catch a cold?

68
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,100
Drink some cold medicine.

69
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,130
Wang Shouyi told me

70
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,780
that you were on a mission today

71
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,850
which was very dangerous.

72
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,660
Mom, it's not dangerous.

73
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,100
It's just an ordinary dispute.

74
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,420
Many people in our police station also went there.

75
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,300
Since so many people went there,

76
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,540
why did they still let you go?

77
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,220
Originally,

78
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,620
I tolerated

79
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,580
to make Cheng Hao be your master.

80
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,020
I also don't want to say anything more.

81
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,190
But Wang Shouyi can't push his luck.

82
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,760
He let you do such a dangerous task

83
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,700
on your second day of work.

84
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,430
Did Cheng Hao incite you to go?

85
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,100
No.

86
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,650
I told you

87
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,320
Cheng Hao couldn't be your master.

88
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,620
What right does he have?

89
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,130
When he was your father's apprentice,

90
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,180
if he was more clever

91
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,260
and smarter,

92
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,710
your dad wouldn't have been sacrificed.

93
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,010
Mom, let's not talk about the past, okay?

94
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,660
How couldn't we mention it?

95
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,460
Your father died

96
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,100
and you fainted at the sight of blood.

97
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,620
You can't blame Chief Cheng.

98
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Why not?

99
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,570
Mom,

100
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,740
I don't have that problem anymore.

101
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,540
So you don't mention it again.

102
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,530
As I said,

103
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,390
the tea cools down as soon as the person is gone.

104
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,340
Mom, don't look at me in that way.

105
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,850
I feel embarrassed to eat.

106
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,500
What did you say?

107
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,260
-Say it again. I didn't hear clearly. -I feel embarrassed to eat.

108
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,620
You feel embarrassed?

109
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,140
I really need to see it.

110
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,180
You even didn't say this word

111
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,140
when you got a goose egg on the exam.

112
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Save face for me.

113
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,180
Mom,

114
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,930
my personality is similar to yours.

115
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,580
What?

116
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,020
The top-flight lady of the labour collective.

117
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,340
The devil of the earthwork.

118
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,980
You are as broad-minded as the sea.

119
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,460
They are all nice to me.

120
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,580
I just didn't want to be special.

121
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,260
How can I be so spoiled as a cop!

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,740
Alright, mom.

123
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,940
Let's not talk about the past.

124
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,420
Can you eat with me?

125
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,380
I'm starving.

126
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,500
I haven't eaten all day.

127
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,210
Okay?

128
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,860
Don't cry.

129
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,360
Here, put on your shoes.

130
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,060
Eat slowly.

131
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
Why are you gobbling down the food?

132
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,160
What if you choke?

133
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,820
Is it because the food is not good

134
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,260
in your police station's canteen?

135
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,480
No, it's good.

136
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
We

137
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,740
didn't have certain meal time when we were on a mission.

138
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,140
When you have something to do at dinner time,

139
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,220
you can't tell them to

140
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,500
wait a moment and let me eat first.

141
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:22,980
Right?

142
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,500
Of course.

143
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,600
You have to work first.

144
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,330
The job is really hard.

145
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,100
Let me get you some soup.

146
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,710
It's not easy.

147
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,740
Here.

148
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,900
You must be tired.

149
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,970
Why don't you eat?

150
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,780
I'm eating. I'm about to eat.

151
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,180
Mom, you eat more.

152
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,540
Give you more.

153
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,850
I'll get you two pieces of meat.

154
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,870
Here.

155
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,610
Not bad, right?

156
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,780
Right, Mom.

157
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,060
As you know,

158
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,660
the police station is hard and

159
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,330
it's far from our house.

160
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,780
The dormitory is also quite tight.

161
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,740
Thus,

162
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,380
I want to rent a house near the police station.

163
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,420
I can live there when I go to work.

164
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll come back here when I take rest.

165
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,290
No.

166
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,500
Mom, what's wrong?

167
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,370
You don't be like this.

168
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,580
I won't rent it anymore, okay?

169
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,820
No.

170
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,290
The Balihe police station is not close.

171
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,820
How about

172
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,250
I call the bureau tomorrow

173
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,370
and ask them to arrange you to work in our neighborhood?

174
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,980
It's just out of our house.

175
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,270
Mom, I beg you.

176
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,170
Please don't call.

177
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,000
I won't rent it.

178
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,160
I can go back and forth.

179
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,620
Jie.

180
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,860
I do it

181
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,580
for your own good.

182
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,260
I know.

183
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,820
Son,

184
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,580
I thought about it.

185
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,020
You are a new employee.

186
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,180
You have to try your best

187
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,890
to work harder.

188
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,630
You have to actively get involved, you know?

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,470
And you have to be on call day and night.

190
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,380
Of course.

191
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
It should be like this if you are on call day and night.

192
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,700
Our family

193
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,620
is indeed far away from your police station.

194
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,640
Here are my thoughts.

195
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,390
I want to rent you a big house

196
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,880
near your company.

197
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,180
Mom, no need.

198
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,260
Don't waste money.

199
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,900
What do you mean?

200
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,340
Is it a waste to spend money on my son?

201
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,220
I earn money for my son.

202
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,220
It's none of your business.

203
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,380
You just feel happy

204
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,140
to do what you like.

205
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,300
Then, I will be fine.

206
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,660
I'm responsible for making money.

207
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
You don't worry about that.

208
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,900
Mom,

209
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,060
the money you earned is also hard-earned.

210
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,350
Besides,

211
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
you've been bringing up her family alone.

212
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm finally working.

213
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,580
I have to share the pressure of my family.

214
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,990
Son, here.

215
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,100
Stretch your face forwards.

216
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,580
My handsome boy.

217
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,740
Why are you so sensible?

218
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,300
Why are you so sensible?

219
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,090
So sensible.

220
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,060
Okay.

221
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,540
It's because it's not easy to make money.

222
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,220
Thus, we should be happy and joyful

223
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,740
when we spend the money.

224
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,580
It's a deal.

225
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,420
None of your business.

226
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,820
Didn't you say that

227
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,940
your mom was the top-flight lady?

228
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,370
Your mother is a devil.

229
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,780
You just need to live there.

230
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,080
I'll rent it.

231
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,340
Fine. ## 行吧(Fine./Okay.)

232
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,540
When I get my salary,

233
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,500
I will pay you the rent.

234
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,490
How dare you!

235
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,170
Mom, I...

236
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,820
Shut up.

237
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,100
Let's eat.

238
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,980
One more bowl.

239
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,260
What? I'll get it.

240
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,220
Sit down. You must be tired.

241
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,580
No, you work hard.

242
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,740
Son, you're tired.

243
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,540
I'll get it.

244
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,820
Let me do it.

245
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,220
That's all I want to say.

246
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,810
Next, please give your instructions, Chief.

247
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,020
What the instructor said are key points.

248
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,460
They are of primary importance.

249
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,820
Especially about learning Fengqiao experience.

250
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,350
you can't just talk about it

251
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,510
and write it down in the copy

252
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,420
which should be executed in specific work.

253
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,540
Especially for you cadets,

254
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,020
you should study harder.

255
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,100
Do you understand?

256
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,300
Yes, sir.

257
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,300
Take Sunshine Community case as an example.

258
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,940
Before solving the problem,

259
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,940
you must do a detailed investigation.

260
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,560
Otherwise, it's to stimulate the conflict

261
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,740
instead of resolving the conflict.

262
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,380
You need to be sincere

263
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,980
with action to make people moved

264
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,700
and use your integrity to convince people.

265
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,700
You need to be patient to implement

266
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,210
persuading education

267
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,090
to dissolve their emotions

268
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,940
and remove the gaps.

269
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,490
Let's reduce the trouble to the minimum

270
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,820
and resolve the conflict at grassroots level.

271
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,940
Our rookie Xia Jie

272
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,660
had really

273
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,940
used her actions to make people moved.

274
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,660
She is indeed the descendant of our hero.

275
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,620
She is very brave.

276
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,180
Chief, I feel embarrassed.

277
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,610
We're all doing this together.

278
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,000
See? She is very modest.

279
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,080
But

280
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,030
I can't let you take any more risks.

281
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,300
Chief, I can take the risky things going forward.

282
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,220
If you didn't say any words,

283
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,690
no one would treat you as a mute.

284
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,530
Really.

285
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,620
Someone said

286
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,660
I was too indulgent

287
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,020
for the residents of Sunshine Community.

288
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,420
How can't I be indulgent?

289
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,980
I've been working here for 30 years.

290
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,420
I saw them

291
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,780
from farmers to working in the city.

292
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,220
They haven't learned

293
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,140
how to become a city resident.

294
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,020
They haven't known

295
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,900
the law of survival in this city.

296
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,740
They don't understand, but we do.

297
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,940
Right?

298
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,859
One of our duties

299
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,740
is to teach these new city residents

300
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,450
to become

301
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,900
a qualified city resident step by step

302
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,140
who will abide by the law of survival in the city.

303
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,390
Alright.

304
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,450
Don't follow the trend

305
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,340
to clap.

306
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,300
Don't be silly again when you face difficulties.

307
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,890
Don't worry, Chief.

308
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,540
We won't.

309
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,140
We won't.

310
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,540
I have another announcement.

311
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,270
Our police station

312
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,760
always has a tradition of mentoring.

313
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,820
Every newcomer

314
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,100
will have a master.

315
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,050
It used to be called One to One help and a pair of Red.

316
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,850
Now it's called inheritance.

317
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,420
The master

318
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,300
not only teaches his apprentice the skills,

319
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,370
but also teaches

320
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,580
what the policeman's honor is and

321
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,180
what the policeman's duty is.

322
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,380
Of course. Young people are also great

323
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,410
who are knowledgeable and have a wide view.

324
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,090
It's totally different

325
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,220
when we first joined the force.

326
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,700
The master

327
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,900
can also learn from his apprentice.

328
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,140
You young people

329
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,030
have your own dreams and ambitions.

330
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,380
But the police station

331
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,530
has its own division work.

332
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,540
Like criminal investigation, community,

333
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,020
security

334
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,780
and household registration, these work need people to learn and do.

335
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,060
You should know

336
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,660
it's impossible that

337
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,580
your master

338
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,540
does this police classification for the whole lifetime.

339
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,780
Got it?

340
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,580
Yes.

341
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,620
For security,

342
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,050
Cheng Hao will be Xia Jie's mentor

343
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,660
which you all know about it.

344
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,180
Cao Jianjun will be Yang Shu's mentor.

345
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,140
This is a pair of stars' team.

346
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,020
Jian Jun has made great contributions in our police station many times.

347
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,360
Yang Shu is a top student

348
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,970
who is the key trainee of the bureau.

349
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,710
Applause.

350
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Chief,

351
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,320
he is a top student in Peking University.

352
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,620
Can I be his mentor?

353
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,850
You're being modest.

354
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,020
You're too modest, Jianjun.

355
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,620
Of course you can.

356
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,220
Yang Shu,

357
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,860
say something to your master.

358
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,050
Master,

359
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,620
I will learn from you.

360
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,060
Relax. You're welcome.

361
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,820
As the Chief said,

362
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,500
we could learn from each other.

363
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,260
For the community,

364
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,900
Zhijie. Zhang Zhijie

365
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,820
will be Zhao Jiwei's mentor.

366
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,820
The community.

367
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,260
I don't need to introduce Zhijie.

368
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,660
He's an all-rounder in our police station.

369
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,740
All-rounder.

370
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,580
Zhao Jiwei, you should learn from your master.

371
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,380
Chief, what about me?

372
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,260
I won't miss you.

373
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,780
Li Dawei.

374
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,420
I assigned you the most capable

375
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,980
and most experienced person in our police station

376
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,340
Officer Chen Xincheng.

377
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,460
Okay.

378
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,340
Wait.

379
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,820
Chief, this can't be.

380
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,700
Why?

381
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,980
I'm not that capable.

382
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,770
Master, I think you can.

383
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,100
You can make it as long as I say it.

384
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,760
Alright, dismissed.

385
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,740
No, no, Chief.

386
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,340
Chief.

387
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,140
Ming.

388
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,220
Chief.

389
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Are you leading the policemen?

390
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,580
Otherwise, you teach them.

391
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,260
No, I can't do it.

392
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,300
This is a rod.

393
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,660
Yang Shu.

394
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,300
Dispatch the police.

395
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,700
Master, what's the alert?

396
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,160
Master, aren't we going to dispatch the police?

397
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,900
No.

398
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,940
We have more than 500 hours'

399
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,980
surveillance footage required to watch.

400
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,460
So?

401
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,220
I hope you can help me now.

402
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,370
Jie, come with me.

403
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,020
Chief.

404
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,890
My goodness.

405
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,580
Why are you squatting here?

406
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,620
Looking for me?

407
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,620
Let's talk inside.

408
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,700
My waist can't squat.

409
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,660
Let's go.

410
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,980
You should visit her when you're free.

411
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,900
Jie, you work here from now on

412
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,440
Just bring your things up later.

413
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,700
Thank you, master.

414
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,330
You're welcome.

415
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,620
Master.

416
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,340
Do the other policemen have offices too?

417
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,980
Of course not.

418
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,380
Not to mention the office,

419
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,860
they even't don't have a desk.

420
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,730
I'd better be like them.

421
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,980
You're a girl.

422
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,180
Why are you comparing yourself with them?

423
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,350
Master, thank you for your kindness.

424
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,060
But since we're all police officers,

425
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,570
there's no need to differentiate girls.

426
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,460
I'd better go downstairs.

427
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,890
Jie,

428
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,500
you have the same temper as my master.

429
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,460
Sit down.

430
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,300
Why should I sit down?

431
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,020
Didn't we

432
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,860
make an agreement previously?

433
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,100
Why are you still torturing me?

434
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,940
What did I promise you?

435
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,180
What did I torture you?

436
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,220
Chief,

437
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,210
you can't do this.

438
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,820
What can't I do?

439
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,410
Okay.

440
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,450
Let me make it clear today.

441
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,860
I can't be Li Dawei's mentor.

442
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,060
Why can't you be his mentor?

443
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,620
I'm old.

444
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,500
I can't afford to worry about that.

445
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,780
Chen Xincheng, just get to the point.

446
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,900
Don't scold me.

447
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,300
You're acting old in front of me.

448
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,090
Aren't you cursing me?

449
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,290
Let me tell you.

450
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,660
What does age stand for?

451
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,620
Age represents experience.

452
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,700
If I'm experienced, can I take someone else?

453
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,010
Find him another master.

454
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,940
I can't be his mentor.

455
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,140
I just announced it downstairs.

456
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,900
How can I

457
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,060
be such a chief?

458
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,460
Really.

459
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,940
Xincheng.

460
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,700
I've observed Li Dawei.

461
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,770
He is a bit impatient,

462
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,540
but his advantages are obvious.

463
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,420
He can be cultivated.

464
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,140
So

465
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,530
I gave him to you

466
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,580
who can make him calm.

467
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,020
Listen.

468
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,660
I'm worried if he is handed over to someone else.

469
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,370
Only by handing him over to you

470
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,540
and ket you keep an eye on him

471
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,500
will that work.

472
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,860
Why are you so sure that

473
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,020
I can keep an eye on him?

474
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,480
I have a lot of troubles,

475
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,150
right?

476
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,420
Chief, let me tell you.

477
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,100
Xincheng.

478
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,490
Come on and have a seat.

479
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,420
Sit down.

480
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,940
I know

481
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,740
where your painful point is.

482
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,500
Since you were wronged in those years,

483
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,980
your mindset has changed.

484
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,940
We all know

485
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,340
what happened.

486
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,980
Well...

487
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,780
It's all in the past.

488
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,930
Just let it go.

489
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,490
At our age,

490
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,400
we still put our time and energy

491
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,150
on the old cliche.

492
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,420
That won't work.

493
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,900
Right?

494
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,700
Don't worry.

495
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,860
I won't let you

496
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,580
rush everywhere

497
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,860
just like Gao Chao.

498
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,900
You just do your own job

499
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,180
and help me take care of your apprentice.

500
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,380
Okay?

501
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,240
Okay.

502
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,620
By the way,

503
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,180
I use this plaster that works quite well.

504
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,900
Put it on your waist.

505
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,020
Put one on your waist. One for each side.

506
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,290
No, I can't do this.

507
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,340
I need a massage.

508
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,380
I'll leave the plaster to your neck.

509
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,390
You're so busy.

510
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,020
It's up to you.

511
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,180
How old are you?

512
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,380
You still have a temper like a child.

513
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,620
Keep an eye on the suspect.

514
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,380
Got it?

515
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,580
Go to change your clothes later.

516
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,460
Go.

517
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:24,980
Chief Gao.

518
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:25,620
Here.

519
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,300
Sun's work summary

520
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,020
is not good

521
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,050
which needs to be more specific.

522
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,260
-Hand it in two days. -Okay.

523
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,420
-Okay. -Remind them.

524
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,220
I know. I know.

525
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,190
Okay, you guys go first.

526
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,660
Brother Xu, come here.

527
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,340
In Xiao Xin Zhuang,

528
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,590
someone broke into the house.

529
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,560
Okay, hurry up.

530
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,220
How old are you?

531
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,020
Master.

532
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,300
I told you on the first day.

533
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,050
How old are you?

534
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,220
22.

535
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,810
What's your name?

536
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,260
Master, you are interrogating the criminal.

537
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,500
Why did you

538
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,280
go to the police academy initially?

539
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,210
My mom asked me to do it.

540
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,220
Your mom?

541
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,820
No.

542
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,820
Your family can't control you anymore

543
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,100
and find a place to discipline you.

544
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,340
That's what I mean.

545
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,490
Seriously?

546
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,220
No. What does your mom take the police academy for?

547
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,980
A daycare center.

548
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,660
Master, what you said

549
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,940
is exactly the same as my mom's words.

550
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,210
Master, do you like wolfberries?

551
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,340
My mom made a bunch of good wolfberries.

552
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,100
I'll bring them to you later.

553
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,980
No need.

554
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,210
Master, don't you like me?

555
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,820
You don't want to be my mentor?

556
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,300
Don't worry. I'll do well.

557
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,020
I won't let you worry about me.

558
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,090
Really?

559
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,820
Yes, I promise.

560
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,290
I will listen to you in the future.

561
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,640
I will report to you

562
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,620
whatever the matter is a big thing or a small thing.

563
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,460
I...

564
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,750
Watch your mouth. I...

565
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,610
Alright, stop talking.

566
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,420
See?

567
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,980
You see if there are desks available.

568
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,420
You can go to the place wherever you want.

569
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,340
Don't follow me.

570
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,980
I'll take some for you.

571
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,130
What are you talking about?

572
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,690
Put them there.

573
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,080
Put them there.

574
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,540
Can you stop following me?

575
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,940
Share part of your desk to me?

576
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,660
This is not mine.

577
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,100
This is Yang Shu's place.

578
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,570
It's the same.

579
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,730
I just use a drawer.

580
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,450
Morning.

581
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,160
Morning.

582
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,420
Remember.

583
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,780
If they have a knife,

584
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,380
we'll remove the knife first before we subdue them.

585
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,820
Protect the people around you.

586
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,980
Sir! Sir!

587
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,140
Move! This way!

588
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,900
Make way!

589
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,260
Stop! Let go!

590
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,450
Let me go!

591
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,020
Handcuff him.

592
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,780
We can't let him out.

593
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,220
In this situation,

594
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,530
you must subdue him in the car.

595
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,500
Don't move.

596
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,580
Hello?

597
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,300
Balihe Police Station.

598
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,110
Jie, you just need to learn

599
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,970
and observe today.

600
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,020
I'm from the Balihe Police Station.

601
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,080
You are suspected of taking and selling drugs.

602
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,340
Don't hit me!

603
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,260
-What are you doing? -Don't hit me.

604
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,740
Are you acting like shooting a movie?

605
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,990
Yang Shu.

606
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,820
Eat quickly.

607
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,740
Balihe Police Station.

608
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,060
Dispatch the police.

609
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,820
Hello?

610
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,660
Balihe Police Station.

611
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,630
Master.

612
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,740
Master!

613
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,040
Master!

614
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,090
Police! Open the door!

615
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,700
Police is enforcing the law and you should cooperate with the work.

616
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,620
Stand still. Don't move.

617
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,240
You don't have to kick the door.

618
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,500
Police is enforcing the law.

619
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,690
ID card.

620
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,260
Yang Shu.

621
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,370
Up there.

622
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,620
Who are you calling deadbeat?

623
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,090
Don't move.

624
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,970
How dare you!

625
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,780
Dawei.

626
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,100
Hello?

627
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,940
Balihe Police Station.

628
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,490
Xia Jie.

629
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,060
Wait here.

630
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,380
You two follow me.

631
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,900
Don't act rashly.

632
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,010
Quiet! Police execution!

633
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,120
Please cooperate.

634
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,340
Show me your ID.

635
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,300
Li Dawei.

636
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,220
Li Dawei.

637
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,360
Dispatch the police!

638
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,620
Jiwei, Jiwei.

639
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,260
We're short-handed.

640
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,300
You follow me to watch the surveillance video.

641
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,660
Go.

642
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,760
Brother Cao.

643
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,780
Move!

644
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,540
What are you doing?

645
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,810
Master, I blocked him.

646
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,520
You should be quick and ruthless to deal with the suspect.

647
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,640
Don't hesitate.

648
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,400
Jiwei.

649
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,090
Stop fighting!

650
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,250
Stop!

651
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,470
Stop! Stop fighting!

652
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,470
Jie.

653
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,740
Qizi, hold him.

654
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,540
Jie.

655
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,370
Behave yourself.

656
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,100
What are you doing? Are you assaulting the police?

657
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,610
How can you enter the boys' dorm?

658
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,679
None of your business.

659
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,239
Is this what the policemen do?

660
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,870
Am I having a nightmare?

661
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,820
That's what the civil police do.

662
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,260
They do trivial things.

663
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,190
It will be fine as long as you get used to it.

664
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,739
I think I need to get used to being scolded by my master.

665
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,949
I think your master is quite good.

666
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,100
Yes.

667
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,360
He must like someone like you.

668
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,280
You're good and educated.

669
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,179
The problem is that he doesn't like me.

670
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,659
Yang Shu, I think your master is very nice.

671
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,199
If I work with him,

672
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,580
we would have a great chemistry.

673
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,969
But now,

674
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,420
I tried so hard to do something.

675
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,820
I have to please my master first.

676
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,650
Why is he

677
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,410
wearing long sleeves in such hot weather?

678
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,510
Isn't he feeling hot?

679
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,170
My master is good.

680
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,000
He's like a cop.

681
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,050
Like a cop.

682
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,350
Isn't he a cop?

683
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,490
Jie, I think you are the best.

684
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,700
Why am I the best?

685
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,380
I heard that Chief Cheng

686
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,900
is your father's apprentice.

687
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,860
He must be nice to you.

688
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,420
Yes, not only him,

689
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,260
all the police officers in our police station are nice to me.

690
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,220
Are you jealous?

691
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,220
Jealous?

692
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,460
The more they do like this,

693
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,380
the more achievements I must make

694
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,860
to prove that I can be a good policeman

695
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,060
who won't let everyone down.

696
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,220
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

697
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,500
What's there to stress about?

698
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,010
For Xia Jie,

699
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,580
it's not that easy.

700
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,520
Is it so profound?

701
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,900
Yes.

702
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,700
It seems that everyone in the firm is nice to her.

703
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,780
They all protected her.

704
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,400
But if they are over-protected,

705
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,430
it will be a cover.

706
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,570
You also don't underestimate Xia Jie.

707
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,970
She graduated from the police academy

708
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,100
who doesn't need protection.

709
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,060
Enough.

710
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,670
You two take me as a topic.

711
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,570
Are you three hungry?

712
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,110
It looks like you are not hungry.

713
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,380
All right, let's go home.

714
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
Read it tomorrow.

715
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,650
Go.

716
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,510
Master, you go first.

717
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,540
I want to finish watching the CCTV.

718
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,050
Don't worry.

719
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,340
Master.

720
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,700
I want to go on a mission.

721
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,540
Did you bring everything?

722
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,280
Yes.

723
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,700
Jianjun, you dispatch again.

724
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,540
A shop in Nanda Street said someone was robbed.

725
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,200
What are you looking at?

726
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,170
Master.

727
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,700
Here.

728
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,740
Here.

729
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,330
From now on,

730
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,570
you use the notebook to take notes no matter it's related to daily work or dispatch.

731
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,430
Don't fool me with some white paper.

732
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,460
Master, it's too big to

733
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,540
be convenient to take it.

734
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,740
That's not necessary.

735
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,100
Why not?

736
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,860
Don't just think about

737
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,860
you can remember everything with your brain.

738
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,140
Do you young people

739
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,940
like to remember everything with mobile phones?

740
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,940
Let me tell you.

741
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,420
The phone will also go wrong at the critical moment.

742
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,200
A good memory is not better than a pen.

743
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,540
You'll understand it later.

744
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,900
By the way, you need to prepare a notebook specifically

745
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,330
for meetings.

746
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,940
The content can be sloppy

747
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,260
that you even can't see clearly

748
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,500
what you write.

749
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,060
But the title and date must be clear.

750
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,060
It's usually useless at ordinary times.

751
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,380
But it's really fatal when it's needed.

752
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,710
[Police Officers Work Notebook]

753
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,700
You can save the life if you have it.

754
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,020
This...

755
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,030
Are you exaggerating it, master?

756
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,980
I won't cheat you.

757
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,060
What do you think?

758
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,740
Okay.

759
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,250
Let's go. I'll show you around.

760
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,980
Really, master?

761
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,780
Notebook.

762
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,240
Master.

763
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,260
Good morning, Officer Zhang.

764
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,860
Morning.

765
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,260
Officer Zhang.

766
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,260
Morning.

767
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,970
Master.

768
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,830
Come on.

769
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,590
Move the car.

770
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,290
Yes.

771
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,230
You're still occupying the way.

772
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,190
I'll move out right away.

773
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,380
I'll call you later.

774
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,060
Okay.

775
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,990
Officer Zhang, you're here.

776
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,170
Thanks for your help last time.

777
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,180
Come and visit us when you have time.

778
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,820
Okay.

779
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,020
Officer Zhang is here.

780
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,700
Morning.

781
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,850
I've caused you trouble again.

782
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,700
No.

783
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,920
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

784
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,940
Officer Zhang.

785
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
Are you boiling water?

786
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,620
Boil some water.

787
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,370
You need to pay attention to the fire.

788
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,210
Okay, don't worry.

789
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:40,990
I...

790
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,140
I'll put it out after it's burnt.

791
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,760
Yes.

792
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,350
You need to clean up later.

793
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,780
Okay, thank you.

794
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,780
Master.

795
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,960
You know everyone in this neighborhood.

796
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,740
One of the most important jobs for us

797
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,500
is to make friends.

798
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,750
Making friends?

799
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,140
Let me write it down.

800
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,090
Yes, when we have more familiar people and more friends,

801
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,490
then in the future,

802
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,930
when the criminal police team and all relevant departments

803
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,420
come to us,

804
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,940
we can know what to say.

805
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,690
Got it?

806
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,860
Although the work in this neighborhood

807
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,700
is mostly about trivial matters,

808
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,170
the key point is

809
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,200
the daily accumulation of these trivial matters.

810
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,130
Got it?

811
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,700
Huang.

812
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,130
Master, I'm done.

813
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,340
Police Officer.

814
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,220
What's wrong, kid?

815
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,700
Please help us.

816
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,420
Police Officer, please take a look.

817
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,220
What's wrong?

818
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,460
What's wrong?

819
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,250
The stray cat downstairs

820
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,980
has been barking for almost a day.

821
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,300
She's pregnant.

822
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,300
Maybe she's going to have a baby.

823
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,460
Save it.

824
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,020
Kid,

825
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,690
this is not the police's business.

826
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,940
You should send it to the pet hospital.

827
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,140
Security.

828
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,160
But my parents don't allow me to play with stray cats.

829
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,700
They said they were too dirty.

830
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,220
They didn't give me money

831
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,860
and asked me to send them to the pet hospital.

832
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,250
Even this cage

833
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,700
was bought by me with pocket money.

834
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,820
I didn't dare to tell my parents.

835
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,500
The teacher said we could look for the police when we have troubles.

836
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,590
Yes, find the police.

837
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,790
Master.

838
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,660
it's not the police's business

839
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,060
to help stray cats deliver a child.

840
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,710
Fine.

841
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,980
I'll send it to the hospital.

842
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,220
Great.

843
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,130
Uncle,

844
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,350
you can send it back

845
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,730
after the cat gives birth.

846
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,780
We usually feed it

847
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,180
when we have time.

848
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,490
Okay, I will send it back when it's recovered.

849
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,540
Huang, you will come back soon.

850
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,020
Let's go.

851
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,210
Master.

852
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,540
Is this what you said to make friends?

853
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,900
Of course.

854
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,780
Kids are also friends.

855
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,780
Let's go.

856
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,700
What Li Dawei means

857
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,850
is that the two of us can catch them.

858
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,670
What? Then you should stop him.

859
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,430
It's too late.

860
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,370
Police! Stop!

861
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,160
Police!

862
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,300
Stop!

863
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
Stop! Police!

864
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,180
Stop!

865
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:53,750
Where is Li Dawei?
