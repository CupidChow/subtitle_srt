00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,620
Actually,

6
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,660
we believe that

7
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,860
it was your father who

8
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,729
walked his dog without a leash,

9
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,220
which frightened the child.

10
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,940
This was where the conflict started.

11
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,259
In the midst of the conflict,

12
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,259
your father fell to the ground

13
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,100
in a fit of excitement.

14
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,180
It was also due to

15
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,860
his personal health.

16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,690
As for

17
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,460
your father's medical expenses,

18
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,020
you can take legal action.

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,740
Chief Wang,

20
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,690
why do you always take their side?

21
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,380
Exactly.

22
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,460
What did you get out of them?

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,180
What are you talking about!

24
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,180
You said we took bribes.

25
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,260
You should be responsible for what you said.

26
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,700
I need you to prove it.

27
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,780
Give us proof.

28
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,500
I... You...

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,290
That's it for today.

30
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,860
Get your families back.

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,460
Or, you're interfering with police business.

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,570
I...

33
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,380
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,850
What now?

35
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,700
You need to sign the Findings of Fact.

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,380
What?

37
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,380
We won't sign it.

38
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,420
No, no, no. We can't sign it.

39
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,500
Why not?

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,010
The fact is established.

41
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,140
Why don't you sign it?

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,730
You haven't given me an answer yet.

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,730
That's right.

44
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,540
You can take legal action

45
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,100
base on that fact.

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,980
I won't.

47
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,940
Why would I do that?

48
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,329
Call the police if you are in any difficulty.

49
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,860
We trust you.

50
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,260
Go, go, go. Let's go.

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,820
Go, go, go.

52
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,780
I'll see them off.

53
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,210
This way, this way, this way.

54
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,610
If that's what the police believe,

55
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,000
why are we here?

56
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,350
Why don't we just go straight to their house?

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,180
What do you think?

58
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes.

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,380
He fell because he fought with them.

60
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,500
They should pay for the medical bills.

61
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,660
Let's block their doors.

62
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,420
Thus, they can't get home.

63
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,020
If it doesn't work, we can drop him off at his place.

64
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,740
Let's see what he'll do.

65
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,450
Right. Right.

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,190
Come on.

67
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,620
You didn't get the money?

68
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,460
All right.

69
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,579
The police here don't do justice.

70
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,540
Let's talk about this back home.

71
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,700
Let's go.

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,829
Come on, get in the car. Get in the car.

73
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,940
If it doesn't work, we can drop him off at his place.

74
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,620
Let's see what he'll do.

75
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,140
Come in.

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,100
You go back first.

77
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,660
What's going on?

78
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,980
What do you mean?

79
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,100
Yesterday I said

80
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,140
you were good at solving complex problems.

81
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,060
So you didn't take it seriously?

82
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,990
Why are you blaming this on me?

83
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,180
Who am I to blame?

84
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
This morning

85
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,340
a whole bunch of people came in here.

86
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,100
Did you have an estimate?

87
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,260
They made trouble in the hospital.

88
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,060
Do you know who started it?

89
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,780
Do I need to know more about this?

90
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,540
It's obvious that they're being unreasonable.

91
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,540
We can't give in.

92
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,790
When we came in,

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,260
we saw that old man walking away in good health.

94
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,339
I'm sure he's fine.

95
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,540
He was carried in

96
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,820
by several men.

97
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,220
I don't have to say anything.

98
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
It's obvious that they are scoundrels.

99
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,580
If so, that would be easy.

100
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,840
And they're easy to deal with.

101
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,220
Zhijie said

102
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,300
there wasn't such a large group of people

103
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,980
in the Shenhui Road Community.

104
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
Only Mr. Sun's eldest daughter lives there.

105
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,060
Well, what do they want to do?

106
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,740
Are they wronged?

107
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,540
Do you think they care about grievance?

108
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,860
Obviously they want to extort some money.

109
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,180
Jianjun,

110
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,220
I need you

111
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,900
to calm the couple down with Yang Shu.

112
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,659
Talk some sense into them.

113
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,940
If it doesn't work,

114
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,420
get them to move out for a while.

115
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,100
Be prepared

116
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
for a long war.

117
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,020
Chief Cheng,

118
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,780
I want you to be more specific about this case.

119
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,460
Find out

120
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,060
which police station they are under

121
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,940
and their social relationship.

122
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,180
Find a break in the case.

123
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,220
Add more men if you need them.

124
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,490
Xincheng

125
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,020
has got a lot of lawsuits

126
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,280
on his side.

127
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,740
He needs some help, too.

128
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,460
Yes.

129
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,490
Doctor, doctor.

130
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,500
There you are.

131
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,340
Sorry, sorry.

132
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,830
Well, you can't do this.

133
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,760
You can't just leave him in our hospital.

134
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,780
We just treat people.

135
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,860
We don't take care of them.

136
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,500
I know. I know. I know.

137
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,890
We're trying to contact his family right now.

138
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,909
But we haven't been able to reach them yet.

139
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,910
His hospital bill hasn't been paid.

140
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,670
Look.

141
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,290
Now,

142
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,710
he eats, drinks and defecates on the bed.

143
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,950
-What should we do?
-I know. I know. I know.

144
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,300
Doctor, why don't you get back to your work?

145
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,500
I'll keep an eye on him.

146
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,890
Pay his hospital fees at once.

147
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,700
It's thousands.

148
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,950
Yes, yes, yes. Okay.

149
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,740
Thank you.

150
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,780
Hello, Master.

151
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,300
Li Dawei, where are you?

152
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm downstairs at Wang Gang's house.

153
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,659
Where are you doing there?

154
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,930
You think you're smart?

155
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,840
Don't be a smart-ass.

156
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,180
No, master, am I...

157
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,370
Stop it.

158
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,500
Come to the hospital immediately.

159
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,260
I'm waiting for you.

160
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,970
Hello, Sir.

161
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm here to...

162
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,900
What's your police number?

163
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,060
I'm filing a complaint now.

164
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,060
Sir, I'm not wearing a police uniform today.

165
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,250
Besides, there's no point in complaining.

166
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,900
Your father is in the hospital with cirrhosis.

167
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,170
You are the only family he has left.

168
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,740
Even if you get rid of me today,

169
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,780
someone else will come to you.

170
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
So you'd better come with us.

171
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,420
I don't have a father.

172
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,980
I've already consulted.

173
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,740
You broke off your relationship with your father

174
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,910
in private.

175
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,580
And the law will say it's valid or not.

176
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,730
Until a verdict is reached,

177
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,040
the court will still impose maintenance obligations on you.

178
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,120
So, if anything happens to him,

179
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,380
we can only come to you.

180
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,460
Okay.

181
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,900
Come on, arrest me.

182
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,980
I'm here to solve the problem.

183
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,900
Why would I arrest you?

184
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,080
You're not gonna arrest me?

185
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,520
I have to go to work.

186
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,210
-Open the door! -Open the door!

187
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,780
Open the door!

188
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,659
Hurry up!

189
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,980
Open the door!

190
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:58,980
Come out!

191
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,780
Stop knocking!

192
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,660
Mom's here.

193
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,860
Mom.

194
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,460
-Open the door! -Get out of here now!

195
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Come out! Come out!

196
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,980
Come out! Hurry up!

197
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,740
Open the door!

198
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,340
The police are coming! The police are coming!

199
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,020
-Hurry up. -Let's go.

200
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,060
Brother, the police are coming.

201
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,290
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

202
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
-Write! -What are you doing?

203
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
You can write again!

204
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,090
Stop running!

205
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,780
Come here!

206
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,780
-Calm down! -Put the knife down!

207
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,820
-Stop running!
-Put the knife down!

208
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,940
Put down the knife!

209
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,730
Come back.

210
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,210
Calm down.

211
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,100
Don't do stupid things on the spur of the moment.

212
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,340
You... Look at them.

213
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,610
I'm done with it.

214
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,620
What's wrong with us?

215
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,860
Their dog chased our child.

216
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,940
And he fell.

217
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,380
We haven't talked to them yet.

218
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,820
What were they doing?

219
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,780
Don't worry.

220
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,500
We won't let them off easily.

221
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,620
Don't scare the baby.

222
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,260
Come here.

223
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,500
Take your wife to your room.

224
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,530
No matter what happens,

225
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,530
don't open the door.

226
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,460
Okay, okay, okay.

227
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,100
Go back. Go back.

228
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,240
Let him in first. Let him in.

229
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,450
Those bastards

230
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
ran really fast.

231
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,020
Let's go to the property office for surveillance.

232
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
There's no surveillance in this community other than the elevator.

233
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Then we're just leaving?

234
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,900
Yang Shu.

235
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,110
Honey, don't worry.

236
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,140
When we get home,

237
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,780
I'll make you favorite dinner.

238
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,140
Okay, okay, okay.

239
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:53,850
Don't worry.

240
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,540
All right. All right. All right.

241
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,250
Want to run?

242
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,140
You're pretending you can't see us?

243
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,920
Come on, show me your ID.

244
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,580
I didn't have it.

245
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,340
Then tell me your ID number.

246
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,620
Sorry, I don't remember.

247
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,500
Fine.

248
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,020
Come back to the station with us and help with the investigation. Go.

249
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,720
What are you waiting for? Show him.

250
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,820
What are you doing?

251
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,300
Well...

252
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,580
Officer,

253
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,710
this is my ID card.

254
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,660
What's yours? Hurry up.

255
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,580
Okay, okay, okay.

256
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,580
Yours.

257
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,140
What have you two been up to lately?

258
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,500
Nothing.

259
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,320
Yeah, nothing.

260
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,560
You think I'm just asking?

261
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,850
I'm just talking to you guys?

262
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,250
Sir,

263
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,800
don't scare me.

264
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,870
I'm a coward.

265
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,330
Would you please tell us

266
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,070
what we did wrong?

267
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,070
We'll make it right, okay?

268
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,870
Don't try to deny it.

269
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,660
You spilled paint upstairs at Liu's house.

270
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,140
You are destroying public property.

271
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,540
No, no.

272
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,940
Sir.

273
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,140
No. You...

274
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,140
Did you see it?

275
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,540
You... You didn't see it.

276
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,300
How could you say

277
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,660
we spilled paint at their house?

278
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,300
Who said that?

279
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,540
Do you have any proof?

280
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,820
Yes, do you have any proof?

281
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,050
Who saw it?

282
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,540
Don't frame good people, okay?

283
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,340
I'll sue... I'll accuse you of framing me. I'll sue you.

284
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,420
Enough. Enough.

285
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,260
Do you really think we have no evidence?

286
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,300
I'm warning you

287
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,540
to prevent you from committing crimes.

288
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,140
If you two

289
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,660
don't take our friendly warning seriously,

290
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,140
then continue.

291
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Well,

292
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,660
we really

293
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,380
don't appreciate it.

294
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,660
Officer,

295
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,770
if you have proof,

296
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,700
come here, cuff us.

297
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,340
If not,

298
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm sorry,

299
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,850
get out of my way.

300
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,580
Honey, let's go home.

301
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,810
Well done, you're finally getting tough.

302
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,960
That was all your credit.

303
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,980
We'll find the evidence.

304
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,300
Okay.

305
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,860
We'll talk when you have proof.

306
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,260
Bye, Sir.

307
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,000
Master.

308
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,380
Listen,

309
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,340
your main task today is to accompany

310
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,620
and take care of Wang Jianguo.

311
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,260
His own son doesn't care about him. We do?

312
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,140
If his own son is taking care of him,

313
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,500
does he need us?

314
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,940
I don't want to have this discussion with you.

315
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,570
Don't you see that?

316
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,060
His son had such a grudge against him.

317
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,950
Do you think talking to him

318
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,860
will solve the problem?

319
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,660
I'll help you.

320
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,370
Listen,

321
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,570
keep monitoring him.

322
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
He still

323
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,980
likes to shit and pee on the bed.

324
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,780
No, Master.

325
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,960
I can't do this.

326
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,900
I didn't take care of my own father like that.

327
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,860
Sooner or later,

328
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,770
your father needs you to take care of him like that.

329
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,260
Take it as a free workout.

330
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,740
Stay here

331
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,660
until the problem is solved.

332
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,420
You're not going anywhere.

333
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,510
Why are you following me?

334
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,250
Go back.

335
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,610
I can't believe I'm doing this.

336
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,730
Sir, you were fine when you hit someone.

337
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,280
Why are you incontinent now?

338
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,540
Nurse!

339
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,620
Nurse!

340
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,820
What's up?

341
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,320
The old man pooped on the bed.

342
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,020
Please send someone to clean it up for us.

343
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,100
Officer, as you can see,

344
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,490
I'm on my own now.

345
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,060
I can't just take care of him.

346
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,180
Call his family.

347
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,140
Sir, Sir, please turn around.

348
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,130
Sir, please lift your foot.

349
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,860
Don't move.

350
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,610
Let me wash it for you.

351
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,500
Thank you.

352
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,180
Thank you. Thank you.

353
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,620
It's my duty.

354
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,530
Stay where you are.

355
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,620
Let me get you a clean pair of pants.

356
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,490
-Sir. -Thank you.

357
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,380
Get up.

358
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,610
I'll get you a new bed sheet.

359
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,460
Sir,

360
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,060
if you don't cooperate,

361
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,020
I'll leave you alone.

362
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,430
I'll let you sleep on shit.

363
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,420
Get up,

364
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,420
please.

365
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,580
Sir, please lift your legs.

366
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,540
Okay.

367
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,860
One leg to go.

368
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,620
Okay. Get it on.

369
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,140
Okay.

370
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,180
Alright.

371
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,060
Nurse, this...

372
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,180
The bathroom is over there.

373
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,930
Come on, Sir.

374
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,980
Watch it again.

375
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,380
Look.

376
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,260
Chief.

377
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,220
Jianjun,

378
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
where are you?

379
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,260
We are watching

380
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,050
security footage from the route of Liu Qiang's house.

381
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,180
What happened?

382
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,290
The Sun family is too cunning.

383
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,180
There's only a couple of cameras along the way.

384
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,180
We didn't see a shred of valuable evidence.

385
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,220
Jianjun,

386
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,700
the masses can't lead normal lives.

387
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,940
Their safety can't be guaranteed.

388
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,700
We are failing in our duty

389
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,290
to allow them to live in such a state of panic.

390
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,869
This must not happen again.

391
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,780
Chief, we don't want

392
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,500
that to continue.

393
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,700
Not to mention negligence,

394
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,900
I'm ashamed of myself.

395
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,140
I wish

396
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,700
I had all the Sun family members in custody right now.

397
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,690
Do you have any evidence?

398
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
I knew you were gonna ask me that.

399
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,180
I don't have any proof right now.

400
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,970
But we must not allow this behavior

401
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,339
to continue.

402
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,339
Jianjun, Jianjun.

403
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,740
I have two things to say.

404
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,350
The first point,

405
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,350
I've just said.

406
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,700
The second point,

407
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,780
the second point is to find a way

408
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
to break out of civil affairs

409
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,730
as soon as possible.

410
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,140
Settle first.

411
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,820
Let the people return to normal life first.

412
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,740
We must do something,

413
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,500
right?

414
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,700
Yes, yes, yes. I totally agree.

415
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,740
Chi... Chief.

416
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,250
Chief Cheng called me.

417
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,730
Maybe he had a breakthrough.

418
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay, take that call.

419
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,500
Chief Cheng, go ahead.

420
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,740
Have some water. Have some water.

421
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,470
Let me show you

422
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,890
the strength of Majiagou.

423
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,150
How dare we mess with them.

424
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,420
I heard that their children

425
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,700
were tough.

426
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,660
The eldest son runs a garage.

427
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,980
The second son owns a restaurant.

428
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,580
Several clues

429
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,340
lead to the brothers

430
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,460
in the gang sweep.

431
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,700
I'm shorthanded.

432
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,660
And I don't have enough time.

433
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,620
I am just about to get to the bottom of it.

434
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,420
You guys came.

435
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,020
The dispute needs to be resolved by the person who has caused it.

436
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,700
Chief Liang,

437
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,660
we need your help

438
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,580
with this case.

439
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,180
No wonder it has been so quiet for a while.

440
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,270
Turns out it's a disaster.

441
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,780
I wonder

442
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,720
-if you can keep them at your place for two more days.
-No, no, no.

443
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,120
You should feel sorry for me.

444
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,580
Let me take a vacation.

445
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:52,970
By the way,

446
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,180
his two sons-in-law

447
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,580
are not easy to deal with.

448
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,820
The second daughter's son is a drug addict.

449
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,020
Drug?

450
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,410
This is an important clue.

451
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,780
But this clue is from the development zone.

452
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,510
I can't reach that far.

453
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,260
I'll take care of it.

454
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,060
But the two sons

455
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,940
are in your jurisdiction,

456
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,780
so you should be in charge of this case.

457
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,440
I know. I know. I'll take care of that.

458
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,250
If you don't do that, it's a dereliction of your duty.

459
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,260
In the year-end satisfaction rating,

460
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,060
if your station

461
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,700
ranks ahead of Balihe,

462
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,770
I'll report you.

463
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,220
Report me?

464
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,060
Even if there is such a thing,

465
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,540
our ranking

466
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,490
is also ahead of yours.

467
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,060
You're still working at Balihe?

468
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,900
Haven't you thought about transferring?

469
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,140
Why are you still there?

470
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,500
You'll lose at least five years of your life.

471
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,450
Come to our station.

472
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,780
We can be partners.

473
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,090
The satisfaction rating of Majiagou next year

474
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,700
will be at a higher level.

475
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Get a taste of being at the top.

476
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,840
Forget it.

477
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,420
I'm not

478
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,490
a fickle person.

479
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,260
We have our own fun.

480
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,090
Chief Liang, I'll leave it to you.

481
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,820
No problem.

482
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,770
Thank you.

483
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,460
Xia Jie.

484
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,930
By the way, I forgot to mention

485
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
that Xia Jie's father

486
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,570
was my Master,

487
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,380
Chief Xia Junxiong.

488
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,880
It's your fault.

489
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

490
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,020
Girl,

491
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,540
how are you and your mother?

492
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,860
We're fine.

493
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,200
You've grown up.

494
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
And you're wearing a police uniform.

495
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,860
This time your dad can turn in his grave.

496
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,850
Thank you, Chief Liang.

497
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,940
We have to get going.

498
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,180
Take care of Xia for me.

499
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,940
Of course.

500
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,810
Let's go.

501
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,380
This way.

502
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,290
Chief.

503
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,030
You didn't get it done?

504
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,340
Have a bite of dinner first.

505
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,500
-Zhijie, sit here.
-Okay, chief.

506
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,180
-Master, I'll get you dinner.
-Okay.

507
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,290
Same as usual.

508
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,600
Two meals.

509
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,160
Master, here you are.

510
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,740
You sit here, too.

511
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,580
I don't think that's appropriate.

512
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,660
Just sit down.

513
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,700
Come on.

514
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,830
Li Dawei...

515
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,180
Hello, this is Balihe Police Station.

516
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,140
What?

517
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,500
What?

518
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,700
Hey, man.

519
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,700
His family didn't want to pay medical bills.

520
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,700
We've done everything we can.

521
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,260
We've paid what's due,

522
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,340
right?

523
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,850
Our colleague

524
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,220
almost broke his leg

525
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,500
over his medical insurance.

526
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,340
And we've arranged for someone

527
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,900
to take care of him at the hospital.

528
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,300
What else do you want?

529
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,100
It's us.

530
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,160
We helped him get there.

531
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,730
We paid for it, too.

532
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,090
We've done everything we can.

533
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,600
What else do you want us to do?

534
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,980
What's going on?

535
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,860
Come on, don't worry about it.

536
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,980
Just eat and change your mind.

537
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,460
I'm getting closer to my case.

538
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,530
Let's have a meeting

539
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,260
and hash it out.

540
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,740
Guys,

541
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,790
I have something to tell you.

542
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,610
About the bus fight,

543
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,260
now we're in trouble.

544
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,830
You two just happened to be here. Listen together.

545
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,610
Well, Mr. Wang's son

546
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,340
disowned his father.

547
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,540
And he left him

548
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,130
in the hospital.

549
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,610
Xincheng

550
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,260
goes to the Social Security office, the street and the hospital every day,

551
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,600
trying to

552
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,820
get his health insurance renewed.

553
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,420
It hasn't been done yet.

554
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,500
Li Dawei

555
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,020
takes care of him in the hospital every day.

556
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,250
The hospital just called.

557
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,260
They asked us to take him back

558
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,780
if we don't pay the bill.

559
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
I was thinking

560
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,500
we could work this out.

561
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,590
It's just a matter of time.

562
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,340
At this point,

563
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,840
we can't

564
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,900
just leave him there, right?

565
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,620
So, I don't have a choice.

566
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,140
I'd like to

567
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,140
start a fundraiser at the station.

568
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,980
Pay for

569
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,890
his hospitalization first.

570
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,350
As for the other problems,

571
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,240
they will be solved, right?

572
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,220
What's wrong?

573
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,100
Have you all lost your tongue?

574
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Why aren't you talking?

575
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,340
Think of it as taking care of your own father, okay?

576
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,620
If your father is in the hospital,

577
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,700
aren't you going to pay the bill?

578
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,620
Chief, don't say that.

579
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,530
We don't have a father like that.

580
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,580
Exactly.

581
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,880
His son leaves him alone.

582
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,070
Why should we take care of him?

583
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,240
Chief,

584
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,190
my father won't asked me for money.

585
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,220
You...

586
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,460
How about this?

587
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,220
I have more than 1,000 yuan here.

588
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,260
I'll take the lead.

589
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,940
Think of it as helping me out.

590
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,620
Okay?

591
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,290
Thank you, guys.

592
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,170
Think about it.

593
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,180
If he gets really sick and dies,

594
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,460
our future work will be more difficult to solve,

595
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,220
right?

596
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,660
We're not doing this for him.

597
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,860
We do it for our job, okay?

598
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,220
Guys.

599
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,580
It's too much.

600
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,140
This is my case.

601
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,940
I'm not capable of handling it.

602
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,460
Guys, what do you think?

603
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,740
Who else?

604
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,580
Chief.

605
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,340
Young people nowadays

606
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,930
are not in the habit of carrying cash when we go out.

607
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,340
How about Alipay?

608
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,830
Okay.

609
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,180
Dou, register it.

610
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:17,900
Okay.

611
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,680
Get a notebook

612
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,970
and take notes.

613
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
This is my money

614
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,140
and Xincheng's money.

615
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,380
It's done.

616
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,460
Okay, I give 500 yuan.

617
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,820
And 500 yuan for Xia Jie.

618
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,100
No, master.

619
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,830
I'll do it myself.

620
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,860
It's okay. It's done.

621
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,010
Remember that.

622
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,510
500 yuan.

623
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,770
I'll transfer the money to you later.

624
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,140
Okay.

625
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,760
I give 300 yuan.

626
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,680
Chief, we're doing this for you.

627
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,940
200 yuan.

628
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,980
Chief, it's for your sake.

629
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,860
Father.

630
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,350
Father.

631
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,470
I give 300 yuan.

632
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,140
Okay.

633
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,090
Chief, I donate 200 yuan.

634
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,690
Thank you.

635
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,170
Why are you here?

636
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,100
I came to check on you.

637
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,620
How are you?

638
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,330
I thought being a cop was about getting rid of the bad guys.

639
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,510
I didn't expect it was shit and piss.

640
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,690
What?

641
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,460
Did you take any pictures?

642
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,730
Why would I take a photo?

643
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,340
If you don't take photos,

644
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,020
how can the boss see it?

645
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,140
Haven't you done all this work for nothing?

646
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,370
It's said online that

647
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,900
when you work,

648
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,260
especially if you work overtime at night,

649
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,870
a bucket of instant noodles and a pack of pickle

650
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,500
are definitely the best materials on Moments.

651
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,570
You even took care of his shit.

652
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,980
This is a once-in-a-century opportunity.

653
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,140
Zhao Jiwei, look at you.

654
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,130
Dawei,

655
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,010
where is the shit pot?

656
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,650
Fine, fine, fine.

657
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,930
-I'll take a photo for you.
-It's disgusting.

658
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,020
I'll save the shit pot for you.

659
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,400
I'll let you take a selfie later, okay?

660
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,280
Sure.

661
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,940
I asked you to look into something for me.

662
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,740
Did you do that?

663
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,550
Yes, yes, yes.

664
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,220
Well,

665
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,260
look.

666
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
This is domestic violence.

667
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,230
Dawei,

668
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,050
let him sleep.

669
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,480
No, this old man is so good at acting.

670
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,050
Wang Gang reported the crime every time.

671
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,820
Wang Jianguo beat his wife when he drank too much.

672
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,980
It has been years.

673
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,820
He deafened the old lady

674
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,610
in one ear.

675
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,580
He deserves to be

676
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,340
left alone.

677
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,780
Somebody cares about him.

678
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,300
The police station.

679
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,420
The Chief asked us to donate money to him.

680
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,530
Your Master donated 500 yuan.

681
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,460
The Chief wouldn't let him donate so much money.

682
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,540
Your Master said

683
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,690
this was his case.

684
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,880
And the case wasn't handled well.

685
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,460
He should have donated this much.

686
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,050
Why would we give him money?

687
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,980
Just leave him alone.

688
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,740
Why would we give him money?

689
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,220
You didn't donate any money, did you?

690
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,940
I donated 50 yuan.

691
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,900
Zhao Jiwei, let me tell you.

692
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,250
Today,

693
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,620
including the photos you just showed me,

694
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,210
I can understand

695
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,540
why his son didn't show up

696
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,820
and why he didn't take care of him.

697
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,900
If I were him, I wouldn't come.

698
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,340
He was irresponsible

699
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,250
when he was young.

700
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,660
When he's old and down and out,

701
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,500
he made his child take care of him.

702
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,160
That doesn't make sense.

703
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,260
Enough.

704
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,180
We all have our crosses to bear.

705
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,170
Well, you go back.

706
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,860
I'll do it for you.

707
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,020
Take a shower

708
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,140
and change your clothes.

709
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,290
Why are you doing this?

710
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,460
It has nothing to do with you.

711
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,060
Does it have anything to do with you?

712
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,140
If this is about you, it's about me.

713
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,310
Besides,

714
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,410
I only donated 50 yuan.

715
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,860
I have no money.

716
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,500
But I have the strength.

717
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,940
The rich can contribute money. The strong can contribute labour.

718
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,060
Besides,

719
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,280
my grandfather was paralyzed in bed for two years

720
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,290
before he died.

721
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
I took care of him all by myself.

722
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,520
Zhao Jiwei.

723
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,780
You...Don't talk to me

724
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,070
about all this touching stuff.

725
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,100
Dawei,

726
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,180
you let me sleep in your room,

727
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,740
and helped me cut my rent.

728
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,020
I meant it.

729
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,900
I know it all by heart.

730
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,230
I haven't made many good friends

731
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,730
in all my years at the academy.

732
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,940
I didn't expect

733
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,100
to meet you and Dashu

734
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,700
in our station.

735
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,460
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

736
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,220
I don't like all this sentimental stuff.

737
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,980
No, Weiwei.

738
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,940
Listen to me.

739
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,340
From now on, we sleep in the study alternately.

740
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,280
Okay?

741
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,040
No, that's not what I meant.

742
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,340
That's not what I meant either.

743
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,930
Keep a safe distance of one meter from me. Thank you.

744
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,380
Okay.

745
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,660
One meter.

746
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,620
Here you are.

747
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,460
I have to call my Master

748
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,300
and tell him about it.

749
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,450
I'm going in.

750
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,850
Remember to go home and change your clothes.

751
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,180
Thanks, bro.

752
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,420
Hello, Master.

753
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,020
Well, I found something.

754
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,980
Wang Jianguo has a long history of domestic violence.

755
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,140
I know.

756
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,980
You do?

757
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,460
Do you have anything else to say?

758
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,500
And Zhao Jiwei is here.

759
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,660
He said he'd take my place.

760
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,620
I know.

761
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,890
You know that too?

762
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,100
What?

763
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,510
Nothing.

764
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
That's all.

765
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,900
I'm telling you.

766
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,650
Wang Gang is the driver of Bus No. 323.

767
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,530
Got it?

768
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,210
323? What does that mean?

769
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,900
323?

770
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,370
I feel so weak.

771
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,070
Nobody in the Sun family

772
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,090
is easy to deal with.

773
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,220
They blocked the door to stir up trouble.

774
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,480
They shouted, abused,

775
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,860
and destroyed public and private property.

776
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,140
What's the difference between them and the underworld?

777
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,180
You even asked me to reconcile them?

778
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,850
Chief, I want to speak.

779
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,460
I support Jianjun.

780
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,740
You've never relented

781
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,180
before

782
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,460
with a bully like this.

783
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,500
Why can't you punish the family this time?

784
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,260
Gao Chao,

785
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:15,090
you are the Deputy Chief in charge of criminal investigation.

786
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,420
Do you have any evidence?

787
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,820
What evidence do you have against the Sun family?

788
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,989
We're doing what needs to be done.

789
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,219
You have to give us time.

790
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,780
You want time?

791
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,850
Does the Liu couple have time?

792
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,130
They suffer every day.

793
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,730
They live in fear.

794
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,739
Their life is hell.

795
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,290
Tell me what's important.

796
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,380
Set priorities.

797
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,659
Which one are you going to deal with first?

798
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,580
Jianjun.

799
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,580
I think the Chief is right, isn't he?

800
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,580
How about this?

801
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,300
I need you to focus on the settlement.

802
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,260
Take care of the urgent matter first,

803
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,490
okay?

804
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,220
I'll work with you

805
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,810
to finish the fight against the gang

806
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,530
as soon as possible,

807
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,460
okay?

808
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,500
That's right.

809
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,140
All right.

810
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,420
We've made it clear.

811
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,940
Well, Chief, break it up.

812
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,090
Wait a minute.

813
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,980
Anything else?

814
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,700
Chief.

815
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,930
Chief Liang is here.

816
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,130
Liang.

817
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,610
-Chief Liang, come on, come on.
-Liang. Liang.

818
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,460
Come on. Come on. Come on.

819
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,180
You're all here.

820
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,220
Thank you, Chief Liang.

821
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,650
Chief Liang.

822
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,620
Sorry to have you here in the middle of the night.

823
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,910
Your hard work is much appreciated.

824
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,500
You gave the order.

825
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,460
Can I not come?

826
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,020
What order?

827
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,620
How can I give you orders?

828
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,500
You...you...

829
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,120
It's our honor that

830
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,100
Balihe Police Station

831
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,900
can do our part

832
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,820
for Majiagou in rooting out local criminal gangs.

833
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,940
By the way, Jianjun,

834
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,850
give Chief Liang the files on the Sun family.

835
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,540
The material is incomplete.

836
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,630
There are many details missing.

837
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,380
Jianjun, haven't I already told you?

838
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,460
Our joint action

839
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,500
with Majiagu Police Station this time

840
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,300
is to strike the Sun's black evil forces.

841
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,860
That is, kill a snake by cutting off the head. Kill him with one shot.

842
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,820
Yes.

843
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,540
I see.

844
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,380
Chief, wait a moment.

845
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,300
Let me get my files.

846
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,020
Chief Liang, here.

847
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,300
Here, here. Chief Liang, please have a seat.

848
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,060
Come on.

849
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,650
Have a seat.

850
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,940
How did you find your way here?

851
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,860
I know you have this habit.

852
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,940
You'll come here

853
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,620
and have a bowl of noodles before you go home.

854
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,260
Don't waste your time.

855
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,090
No matter what you say, I stay out of his business.

856
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,940
So, don't waste your time.

857
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,580
Your noodles are ready.

858
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,380
Okay, thank you.

859
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,140
Enjoy yourself.

860
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,680
I actually quite understand you.

861
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,840
I checked your police records.

862
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,340
And I know

863
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,660
all the shit your dad did to your mom.

864
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,980
If this happens to anyone,

865
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,060
he'd be just like you.

866
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,970
But you can't do it now.

867
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,440
Your father has cirrhosis of the liver.

868
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,270
He'll live if you save him.

869
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
If you don't save him...

870
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,140
He'll die. He deserves it.

871
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,560
I'm not supposed to

872
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,840
be saying this to you

873
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,900
as a man in uniform.

874
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,110
But I can really understand you.

875
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,130
Because my dad is a jerk, too.

876
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,820
As long as I can remember,

877
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,540
he never told my mom the truth.

878
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,690
He lied to my mom.

879
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,080
My mom didn't even have a life.

880
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,430
Fortunately, my mother had a big heart.

881
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,260
She worked so hard to bring me up.

882
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,370
Ordinary people can't make it through.

883
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,300
What's worse is that

884
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,940
his business is endless.

885
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,740
The other day,

886
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,900
I almost took my uniform off again

887
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,420
because of something my father did.

888
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,650
I've never told anyone this before.

889
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,940
The Station and the Bureau

890
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,710
asked me almost interrogatively,

891
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,490
and I didn't say anything.

892
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,700
Why am I talking to you here today?

893
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,010
I really want you to know

894
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,760
that I really understand how you feel.

895
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,820
If it weren't for my duty,

896
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,220
I wouldn't be advising you at all.

897
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,030
Even if I try to persuade you now,

898
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,620
I would only be doing my duty.

899
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,180
If you don't listen to me,

900
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,320
I can understand.

901
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,050
He's older than my mom.

902
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,110
He's always picking on my mom for no reason.

903
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,260
They quarreled at first.

904
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,780
Then he started swearing.

905
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,460
And it got worse and worse.

906
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,180
Then he started drinking.

907
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,420
He hit my mom when he was drank.

908
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,020
He drank more and more.

909
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,230
And he hit harder and harder.

910
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,300
I finally grew up.

911
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,860
I brought my mom out to live with me.

912
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,420
But my mom's softhearted.

913
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,260
She's worried about him,

914
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,020
so she asked me to take him out, too.

915
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,140
Guess what?

916
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,480
He got my mom on her knees

917
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,370
and beat her

918
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,330
in front of my kid.

919
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,460
My son was only one year old.

920
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,320
He just learned to walk.

921
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,370
Wait.

922
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,300
There's one more thing I need to tell you.

923
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,380
This is not the first time he's gotten in trouble.

924
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,910
It's the second time.

925
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,320
Both were on your bus.

926
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,530
323.

927
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,990
Done.

928
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,140
Okay, bye.

929
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,260
Boss, check, please.

930
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Master,

931
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,300
what are you doing here?

932
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,000
Go back.

933
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,320
♫ Like a seed ♫

934
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,650
♫ Kissing the season ♫

935
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,500

00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,390
♫ Chases green leaves ♫

939
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,150
♫ I choose to compromise ♫

940
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,040
♫ And embrace love ♫

941
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,890
♫ Love ♫

942
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,730
♫ From the smallest ♫

943

♫ Dream in the sunset ♫

946
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:26,040
♫ To name the eye of the night ♫

947
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:36,130
♫ Listen to the flower in the cloud ♫

948
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:46,110
♫ I am not afraid to become dirt ♫

949
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:51,780
♫ I am running to you ♫

950

00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:15,170
♫ Flowers ♫

953
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,610
♫ Becoming dirt ♫

954
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:25,020
♫ I'm not afraid ♫
