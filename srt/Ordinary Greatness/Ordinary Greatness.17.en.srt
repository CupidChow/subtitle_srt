[I want to be a good cop.]

5
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,970
Mom. I'm back.

6
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,250
You're back.

7
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,140
Jie.

8
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,690
Your aunt's family will go on a vacation to Dali,

9
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,570
and they asked me to go with them.

10
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,020
How about I call the bureau office?

11
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,140
Just go if you want to go to Dali.

12
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,700
Why will you call the bureau?

13
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,100
But when your dad left,

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,610
they promised...

15
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,180
Mom. It's been ten years.

16
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,980
Let's not trouble the bureau anymore.

17
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,940
If you want to go to Dali,

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
I'll arrange it.

19
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,020
By the way, mom.

20
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,320
Last time aunt said

21
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,620
there were two bedrooms in their house, didn't she?

22
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,510
Then aunt and her husband would live in the big room

23
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,970
and the small one would be suitable for you.

24
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,260
It's... It's not convenient, right?

25
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,180
Why not?

26
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,579
My elder cousin isn't going.

27
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,410
Besides,

28
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,500
I'm relieved that you're with aunt.

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,610
It's still inconvenient.

30
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,180
6,000.

31
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,180
10,000.

32
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,460
12,000.

33
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,500
It's crazy.

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,690
Aunt.

35
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,730
Jie.

36
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,240
Your mom said you didn't want her to live in my house

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,520
and wanted to rent outside.

38
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,330
Aunt. It's my mom who wants to live alone.

39
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,460
I guess she thinks living with you,

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,180
she couldn't have a good relationship with Uncle Liang.

41
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,060
I see.

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,010
That makes sense.

43
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,320
But the rent is too expensive during the travel season in Dali.

44
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,660
Otherwise,

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,050
your uncle Liang has a dormitory in his workplace.

46
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,340
How about letting him help solve a house?

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,060
Aunt. It's not good.

48
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,380
My mom's relationship with him is not clear yet.

49
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,740
I'm afraid if my mom lives in his house

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,620
and doesn't think highly of Uncle Liang in the future,

51
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,390
she'll feel indebted

52
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,370
and aggrieved.

53
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,200
You're thoughtful.

54
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,550
But the rent in Dali...

55
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm searching.

56
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,880
Why is it so expensive?

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,840
It costs more than 10,000 yuan per room around your area.

58
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm in a good area,

59
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,690
right next to the Erhai Sea.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,070
How about I give your mom...

61
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,300
No, aunt.

62
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,070
Now it has been a lot of trouble for you.

63
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,480
I can afford the rent.

64
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,340
Don't worry.

65
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,510
I'll rent it for her tonight.

66
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,100
Aunt. My mom is going to give you trouble again

67
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,779
this time.

68
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,329
And

69
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,300
you can create opportunities

70
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,860
for my mom and Uncle Liang.

71
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,380
But don't rush my mom.

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,580
My mom sometimes doesn't consider the problem too mature.

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm afraid she'll regret it in the future

74
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,840
after being urged

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,970
to make an impulsive decision.

76
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,100
Jie.

77
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,330
People who know that she is your mom,

78
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,030
or they'll think you're her mom.

79
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,620
All right, go back.

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,990
Remember what I said.

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,700
Be careful, and let me rest assured.

82
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,090
Okay. Got it.

83
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,810
You too.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,320

before you get home.

My daughter is still very young.

111
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,900
It's dark outside now.

112

find my daughter.

No, Officer Xia is really on duty now.

Are you close to my daughter?

125
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,820
I added Jing on WeChat.

126
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,440
When did you add her on WeChat?

127
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,700
Why didn't I know?

128
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,740
No wonder my daughter is always missing.

129
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,220
It's you who instigated her, isn't it?

130
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,140
Ms. Wu. You can't say that.

131
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,260
Officer Xia is a policeman.

132
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,460
She must have added your daughter on WeChat

133
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,340
due to her concern.

134
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,220
Concern?

135
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,220
My daughter is only 12 years old.

136
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,540
She added my daughter on WeChat without my permission.

137
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,700
What is she thinking?

138
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,420
Calm down.

139
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,610
That's not the point.

140
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,460
The point now is to find your daughter first,

141
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,130
right?

142
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,460
Tell me more.

143
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,180
How long has she been out of touch?

144
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,220
An hour.

145
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,020
More than an hour.

146
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,340
I took her home today

147
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,370
and I cooked for her.

148
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,950
I asked her to do homework in her room.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,820
I thought she was in the room.

150
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,770
When I went in,

151
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,970
no one was there.

152
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,190
I've searched all over the house,

153
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,830
but I couldn't find her.

154
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,810
Jing replied to me on WeChat.

155
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,220
She said she's at her classmate's home.

156
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,060
Same as last time.

157
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,420
Really?

158
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,300
She said so.

159
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,620
Wait.

160
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,330
I'd better call her out and send her home.

161
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,520
You?

162
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,890
She told me her whereabouts,

163
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,930
but she didn't want you to know.

164
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,340
If you know it from me

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,310
and go to her directly,

166
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,940
I'm afraid she won't even tell me next time.

167
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,430
You mean she trusts you

168
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,090
not me, her mom?

169
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,060
Dr. Wu.

170
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,900
If you want to avoid such things from happening again,

171
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,270
please let me go first.

172
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,930
Otherwise, I'm afraid that if she leaves home again next time,

173
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,940
it'll be hard for you to find her again so smoothly.

174
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,340
Dr. Wu.

175
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,140
Let's think about it calmly.

176
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,570
At a time like this,

177
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,700
is your child more important or your pride?

178
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,300
Okay.

179
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,420
You go home first

180
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,020
and pretend that nothing has happened.

181
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
Jing will be back soon.

182
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,100
Hao.

183
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,900
Hao.

184
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,370
Coming.

185
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,220
Help me on duty. Okay.

186
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:12,920
I need to go for the alert.

187
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,020
Thank you.

188
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,180
Xia Jie, what kind of alert needs you to go?

189
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,020
I'll go.

190
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,620
Nothing. It's okay.

191
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,300
Chief Cheng, I happen to be on the way.

192
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,140
I'll go with her.

193
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,930
Okay. Take care.

194
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,340
Let's go.

195
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,490
Hao. Hao.

196
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,620
What's the alert?

197
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,220
Well...

198
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
I'm not sure.

199
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,740
I went out to deliver the documents.

200
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:39,860
Get back to work.

201
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,940
Yes.

202
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,510
Li Dawei.

203
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,420
Thank you.

204
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,500
For what?

205
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,100
I know

206
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,700
you're afraid that my master knows

207
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,180
that I'm involved in Jing's matter again.

208
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,740
I also think

209
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,830
you're ill-considered

210
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,110
on adding that little girl on WeChat.

211
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,520
You know what kind of person her mom is.

212
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,210
They had so many conflicts before.

213
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,060
Besides,

214
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,570
Jing is a minor.

215
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,340
If something really happens one day,

216
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,820
Dr. Wu will make a false countercharge on you

217
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,660
and you can't even avoid.

218
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,940
By then, you won't be able to explain

219
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,130
even though you're covered in mouth, you know?

220
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,820
Who cares about that kid?

221
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,860
What?

222
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,620
We only care about our own safety.

223
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,970
Then who would care about that kid?

224
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,860
Her mom.

225
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,180
She's a minor.

226
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,930
Her mom is her legal guardian.

227
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,260
When I see her,

228
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,370
I feel like I see myself.

229
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,340
What are you talking about?

230
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,610
You don't look like her.

231
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,660
Why not?

232
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,540
We lost our fathers at 12

233
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,550
and our mothers entrusted everything to us.

234
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,660
Have you ever thought

235
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,900
why the girl wanted to run away again and again?

236
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,470
She couldn't stand her mom

237
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,650
and that pressure.

238
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,290
But you've never run.

239
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,770
Yeah.

240
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,610
So I think I'm not as good as her.

241
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,440
I have nowhere to run.

242
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,270
My dad is a hero.

243
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,620
My mom sacrificed everything for that.

244
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,700
How can I run? Where can I go?

245
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,210
Sister, I really don't want to go home.

246
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,740
Jing.

247
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,900
Your mom

248
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,870
doesn't do well in many aspects.

249
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,520
But you're not young anymore.

250
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,820
You should tell your mom

251
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,730
what she did wrong

252
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,740
and help her correct it.

253
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,820
Mom loves you after all.

254
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,800
You can't solve any problem

255
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,110
by having a cold war with her like this again and again.

256
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,250
Didn't your mom praise you

257
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,430
for you were the second in the class last time?

258
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,730
She will never praise me.

259
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,090
I told her I was the second in the class,

260
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,340
but she asked me why I wasn't the first.

261
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,130
She also said with my grades I was proud

262
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,780
even though I can't even make it to the top ten of my grade.

263
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,960
If you think your mom is pushing you too hard,

264
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,730
you can totally bring it up.

265
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,940
For example, let you play for half an hour after the meal.

266
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,990
You're already 12 years old.

267
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,930
You can completely communicate with your mom.

268
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,020
But you run away like this,

269
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,620
your mom will be worried, right?

270
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,900
Sister, I'm wrong.

271
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,420
Then you promise me

272
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,790
that if anything happens in the future,

273
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,010
you'll text me on WeChat

274
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,900
but won't go missing again, okay?

275
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,000
Sister, I promise you.

276
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,380
Mom.

277
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,740
Where did you go?

278
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,300
Do you know how worried I was?

279
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,520
Are you trying to kill me?

280
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,380
Mom, I'm wrong.

281
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,890
I shouldn't have come out alone.

282
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,930
and shouldn't have ignored your call.

283
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,140
Go home.

284
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,500
Let's go.

285
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,140
Sir.

286
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,630
Come in.

287
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,050
Chief.

288
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,140
Dr. Wu is here again.

289
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,380
Why is she here again?

290
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,780
She asked to see you.

291
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,620
She said Xia Jie added her daughter on WeChat

292
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,980
without her permission

293
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,820
and instigated her daughter to run away from home.

294
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:58,970
She also said

295
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,060
if you don't discipline Xia Jie,

296
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,660
she will complain about our station again.

297
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,140
Alright, I know.

298
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,620
Go down and calm her down.

299
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,660
OK. I see.

300
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,020
Chief Cheng, ask the instructor

301
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,040
to come to me together.

302
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,420
Something happened again?

303
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,540
Instructor.

304
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,180
Coming.

305
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,980
Chief.

306
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,650
What's wrong with you?

307
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,800
After eating 100 beans,

308
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,510
don't you know they are fishy?

309
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,610
Don't you learn the lesson?

310
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,140
Why did you add her on WeChat?

311
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,700
I just think that girl needs friends.

312
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,720
Kid,

313
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,060
why are you so naive?

314
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,740
That girl is a minor.

315
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,450
Dr. Wu is her guardian.

316
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,780
Dr. Wu can say

317
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,100
you added her on WeChat

318
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,700
without her permission.

319
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,100
She can sue you.

320
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,740
It's my fault indeed.

321
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,500
Really. It's my fault.

322
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,860
I wish I could go with her yesterday.

323
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Well, Xia Jie,

324
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
when you see Dr. Wu

325
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,640
after going down,

326
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,380
talk to her properly.

327
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,060
Deleted the WeChat

328
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,240
in front of her.

329
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,850
Chief, I can't delete it.

330
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,100
If anything happens to that girl,

331
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,460
she would tell me on WeChat.

332
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,640
I can guide her, comfort her

333
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,570
and protect her.

334
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,380
You still want to protect her?

335
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,660
You can't even protect yourself.

336
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,600
Well, Xia Jie,

337
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,820
don't blame the chief for being anxious.

338
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,060
A mother like her

339
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,400
may push the kid into trouble

340
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,830
at some point.

341
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,860
Who will be responsible then?

342
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,860
It's hard to explain.

343
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,940
Listen to the chief. Delete the WeChat.

344
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,540
Delete.

345
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,430
Dr. Wu. Have some tea first.

346
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,810
I'm not here for tea.

347
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
Where's your chief?

348
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,180
Why is he avoiding me?

349
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,300
Is he afraid of me?

350
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,290
Dr. Wu. Dr. Wu.

351
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,860
Long time no see. Long time no see.

352
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,780
How are you?

353
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,340
You see, this time

354
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,770
thanks to our Officer Xia

355
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
to find back the kid

356
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
who ran away from home.

357
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,380
That's a relief.

358
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,220
Chief Wang.

359
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,650
I'm not here to praise you

360
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,130
or give you the banner.

361
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,120
No?

362
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,770
As the police, it's your duty

363
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,780
to help people to solve their problems.

364
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,660
Why else should we taxpayers support you?

365
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,340
Yes, yes, yes.

366
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,980
Then you are...

367
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,660
Your Officer Xia

368
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,780
added my daughter on WeChat

369
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,220
without my permission.

370
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,130
My daughter is only 12 years old.

371
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,540
Twelve!

372
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,150
What does she want?

373
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,900
No wonder my daughter ran away from home recently.

374
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,180
Someone instigated her.

375
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,980
Look.

376
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,690
You're exaggerating.

377
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,730
This word is not suitable.

378
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,660
Yes.

379
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,400
You see, as you said,

380
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,550
your daughter is always running away.

381
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,860
Xia Jie

382
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,340
added her on WeChat

383
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,780
after we found her last time, right?

384
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,010
Luckily she added her on WeChat.

385
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
As soon as she ran away this time,

386
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,740
she got in touch immediately

387
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,460
and we found her, right?

388
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,060
How could she like you said

389
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,230
to ins... instigate her?

390
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,300
That's impossible.

391
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,700
Of course.

392
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,020
Well, you...

393
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,900
Your daughter is still underage.

394
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,340
She added her on WeChat

395
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,180
without your permission.

396
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,020
That's also not right.

397
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,740
How about this?

398
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,700
I'll call her in

399
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,820
to apologize to you in front of you

400
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,260
and then delete the WeChat.

401
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
What do you think?

402
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,220
Ask her to come in!

403
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,260
Take your time. Have some tea.

404
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,020
Xia Jie!

405
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,140
Xia Jie!

406
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,500
She'll be here soon. Have some water first.

407
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,580
Dr. Wu. You're here.

408
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,230
Come on.

409
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,430
Officer Xia.

410
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,599
You added my daughter on WeChat

411
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,970
without my permission.

412
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,250
Give me an explanation.

413
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,740
Didn't I explain it to you just now?

414
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,849
That's your explanation.

415
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,940
I want to hear what she says now.

416
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,900
Here's my chat with her.

417
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,160
You can take a look.

418
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,740
You saw everything, right?

419
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,300
Most of it was your daughter talking to me.

420
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,860
I'm busy with work.

421
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,090
Many times I just give her a like

422
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,890
or an encouraging look.

423
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,570
Your daughter is too eager to talk to someone.

424
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,870
I just want to give her this place.

425
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,870
My daughter can find me if she wants to talk to someone.

426
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm her mom.

427
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,980
Who are you?

428
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
How can you add my daughter on WeChat without permission?

429
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,780
I'm sorry.

430
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,620
I didn't think that much at that time.

431
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,060
Dr. Wu. Here's the thing.

432
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,850
It's me who ordered Officer Xia to do this.

433
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,910
Because of what happened last time,

434
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,180
we're worried about the kid.

435
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,740
We're afraid something like this might happen again.

436
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,460
Think about it. If she runs

437
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,620
to a place without CCTV

438
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,100
where we simply can't see,

439
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,420
will we be more anxious?

440
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,610
Of course. I didn't inform you in advance of this matter.

441
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,990
I was thoughtless.

442
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,780
Please forgive me.

443
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,570
Master.

444
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,510
Dr. Wu, as you can see,

445
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,040
thanks to Officer Xia added the kid on WeChat this time,

446
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,260
we were able to find the kid so quickly.

447
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,180
Okay.

448
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,220
If you think this is getting in your way,

449
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,490
then I'll ask her to delete, okay?

450
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,140
Dr. Wu.

451
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,120
It's my fault

452
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,070
to add her on WeChat without your permission.

453
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,660
But Jing is not young anymore.

454
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,660
Does she need your permission

455
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,740
to add someone on WeChat?

456
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,700
Do you think it's good?

457
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,650
What do you mean?

458
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,980
I mean she is 12 years old.

459
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,700
She is a normal kid.

460
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,900
She needs her own life and space.

461
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,300
You're too strict.

462
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,740
It's my business how I manage her.

463
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,050
Do I need your lesson?

464
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,300
Dr. Wu.

465
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,780
I think Officer Xia means

466
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,910
because she's young,

467
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,540
she may know more than we do

468
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,020
about the everyday real thoughts

469
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,810
of kids as old as Jing is.

470
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,420
Enough. Stop talking.

471
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,270
Xia Jie. Come on.

472
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,100
Delete.

473
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,460
Chief, I promised Jing.

474
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,780
If anything happens again, she won't run away.

475
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,010
She can tell me on WeChat.

476
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,340
If I'll delete her,

477
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,730
I should have told her in advance.

478
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,860
What do you mean?

479
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,740
Don't say a word now.

480
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,700
This is an order.

481
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,400
Delete.

482
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
Then I'll send her a WeChat message.

483
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,100
I'll tell her I'm going to delete her.

484
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
What are you doing?

485
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,380
Aren't you provoking our relationship?

486
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Xia Jie. Obey the order.

487
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,100
Xia Jie.

488
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,680
This is Dr. Wu's family matter.

489
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,420
She doesn't want to let others in charge,

490
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:50,850
just leave her alone.

491
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,100
Xia Jie, wait a minute.

492
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,620
Li Dawei. Why did you come in?

493
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,860
Dr. Wu, please listen to me.

494
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,420
It happens that I was there yesterday.

495
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,930
What a coincidence.

496
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,250
It's me who sent the kid back together with Xia Jie.

497
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,480
I also blamed her on the way back.

498
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,390
I said Why did you

499
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,810
add a kid on WeChat?

500
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,380
Isn't this getting yourself into trouble?

501
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,370
Do you know what Xia Jie told me at the time?

502
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,500
Xia Jie said

503
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,890
if everyone in this world is afraid of trouble,

504
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,660
everyone only cares about their own safety,

505
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,020
then who cares about the kid?

506
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,380
Dr. Wu, you know

507
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,900
Xia Jie is a policeman.

508
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
Every day

509
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,650
she's busy for over ten hours around the clock.

510
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,740
She doesn't have the time

511
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,870
and she doesn't have the energy

512
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,160
to chat with a kid.

513
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,330
She knew you hated her,

514
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,580
but she still added Jing, your daughter on WeChat.

515
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,740
Why?

516
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,460
Because during the investigation of last case

517
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,420
she found out that your daughter doesn't have many friends

518
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,300
but she needs and desires the company of others.

519
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,670
On the other hand,

520
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,460
she also draws closer to Jing

521
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,930
in this way.

522
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,380
So that if Jing has any ideas,

523
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,260
if anything happens,

524
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,490
we can at least know immediately, right?

525
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,780
Just like this time,

526
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,900
your daughter ran away from home.

527
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,980
It was because Xia Jie has her WeChat

528
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,110
that we were able to find the kid back so quickly.

529
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,780
You forced Xia Jie to delete her WeChat now.

530
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,420
What if this happens again?

531
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,500
Have you thought about it?

532
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,300
Is there any other way at that time?

533
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,380
I've made up my mind.

534
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,220
I'm responsible for my own family affairs.

535
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,400
No need for others to care.

536
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,820
OK.

537
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
Xia Jie, delete it.

538
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,670
Li Dawei.

539
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,710
You need to be kind to those who deserve it.

540
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,260
Why are you doing this useless thing?

541
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,690
Alright, Dr. Wu.

542
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,940
It's settled.

543
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,100
It's my fault from the beginning. I want to...

544
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,780
Master.

545
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,500
You don't have to cover for me.

546
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,030
Dr. Wu, I apologize to you.

547
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,700
But this has nothing to do

548
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,690
with my master.

549
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,860
It's my own idea.

550
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,220
Master, you don't have to protect me anymore.

551
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,460
I'll take responsibility for what I've done.

552
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,380
But Dr. Wu,

553
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,940
I want to say one more thing.

554
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,900
Your daughter is indeed yours,

555
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,700
but she is also an independent person.

556
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Your control over her

557
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,100
has put her under a lot of pressure.

558
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,540
If you don't change

559
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,460
your way of love,

560
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,060
- I'm afraid that when I'm away from home... 
- Stop there.

561
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,510
This kind of thing will still happen.

562
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,370
Say it again!

563
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,260
Ms. Wu, calm down.

564
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,370
Well, Xia Jie

565
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,630
just remind you on your way treating your daughter

566
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,580
out of kindness.

567
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,730
Do I need her reminder?

568
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,300
That's my daughter. Can't I teach her?

569
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
What does she want?

570
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,450
What does she mean that my daughter will run away from home again?

571
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,620
Are you provoking our relationship?

572
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,210
What...

573
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,860
What do you mean?

574
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,630
She has nothing else to do?

575
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,390
She provokes your relationship?

576
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,700
Provoke what relationship?

577
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,580
How can you say that?

578
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,060
Well,

579
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,460
I'm also here today to make a statement.

580
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,420
Xia Jie will not be involved

581
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,140
in your family's future cases.

582
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,670
OK?

583
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,140
I think so.

584
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,900
Chief.

585
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,820
Enough. Stop talking.

586
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,700
Go. Let's go.

587
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,260
What are you looking at? Dismiss.

588
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,570
Don't push me.

589
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,140
Come here.

590
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,700
Let go.

591
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,820
Xia Jie, listen to me.

592
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,610
You are not that little girl.

593
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,740
Your mom

594
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,690
is not that crazy Dr. Wu.

595
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,420
Don't put your own shadow

596
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,560
to that little girl.

597
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,570
You can't solve any of your problems by helping her.

598
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,780
What do you know?

599
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,100
Who are you to judge my affairs?

600
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,540
I'm worried for you.

601
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,530
Don't be emotional.

602
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,810
The final result of this matter

603
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,120
is not what you think.

604
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,930
Then that's my business.

605
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,740
Xia Jie, have you thought about

606
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
that look from another angle,

607
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,760
The stubborn you

608
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,390
is another form of Dr. Wu.

609
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,820
I may have said a little serious.

610
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,390
But think about it.

611
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,100
Can't that little girl really grow up

612
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,460
without you?

613
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,580
Why do you insist that

614
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,470
she'll be safer with your involvement?

615
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,300
Of course, there's certainly nothing wrong

616
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,610
with you wanting to help that little girl.

617
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,780
But in this situation,

618
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,190
her relationship with her mother

619
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
is already so tense.

620
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,380
Her mother has a deep prejudice against you.

621
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,180
If you insist on getting involved,

622
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,220
will it really make it better?

623
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,260
Li Dawei.

624
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,390
I promised Jing

625
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,110
to tell her on WeChat if something happens in the future.

626
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,890
But I deleted her

627
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,820
without saying a word.

628
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,020
It's easy.

629
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,900
Leave it to me.

630
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,740
Hello.

631
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,140
Dear Ms. Xia,

632
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,400
you have passed the review

633
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,940
and have officially become a fast ride driver.

634
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,930
I heard everything.

635
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,500
What's wrong with you?

636
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,700
You really don't want to be a police?

637
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,970
Keep your voice down.

638
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,340
Tell me!

639
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,420
What happened?

640
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,300
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

641
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,580
I can't watch you ruin your future.

642
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,300
You won't tell me?

643
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,220
Then I'll go for the chief.

644
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,340
I'll ask him to stop you.

645
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,660
Li Dawei! Why do you care so much?

646
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,860
Of course I have to.

647
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,930
The Balihe Police Station can't do without you.

648
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,700
Why did you do such a disciplinary thing?

649
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,900
Can you keep your voice down?

650
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,540
No.

651
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,480
- Why would you do something like that?
- Enough.

652
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,860
I promise you, okay?

653
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,420
Give me five as proof.

654
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,260
I really have another mom now.

655
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,820
Is grandpa here? Bye.

656
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,350
- Where's mom?
- Bye.

657
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,420
Here.

658
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,610
Jing.

659
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,860
Jing.

660
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,930
Uncle, I've seen you.

661
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,940
Yes, I'm from Balihe Police Station.

662
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,620
I came here with Officer Xia Jie before.

663
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,980
Uncle.

664
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,380
Why did sister Jie delete my WeChat?

665
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,860
Your sister Jie

666
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,100
was sent to carry out a secret mission.

667
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,700
The leader won't let her contact with others.

668
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,100
She deleted everyone.

669
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,900
But she still cares about you.

670
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,100
She's afraid you'll misunderstand her.

671
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,500
So she asked me to explain to you.

672
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,050
I see.

673
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,420
But Uncle, can I still call sister Jie

674
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,900
if I need help in the future?

675
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,580
She is on a secret mission.

676
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,180
I'm afraid we can't contact her.

677
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,730
This is my number on the note.

678
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,010
Call me if you need help in the future.

679
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,580
Thank you, uncle.

680
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,910
Where are you going in the middle of the night?

681
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,360
Why should I report to you on what I do?

682
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,720
Are you going to drive an online car?

683
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,180
How can you so stupid

684
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,770
at the critical moment?

685
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,180
If the station found out that

686
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,940
you're driving an online car,

687
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,220
you'll be fired, you know?

688
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,020
The station won't know

689
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,020
as long as you don't say it.

690
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,090
Stupid!

691
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,620
What is done by night appears by day.

692
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,620
Don't you hear of that?

693
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,580
In such a small place,

694
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,780
people meet regularly or frequently.

695
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,050
You don't know who you're going to drive.

696
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,900
Don't go.

697
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,180
Get out of my way.

698
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
I can't just watch you make mistakes.

699
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,580
Why don't you close your eyes?

700
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,780
You two...

701
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,580
Just in time.

702
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,180
Close the door. Don't let Xia Jie make mistakes.

703
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,460
Don't listen to him.

704
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,620
Wha tdo you think she's driving an online car?

705
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,780
Driving an online car?

706
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,960
Did I hear it right, Xia Jie?

707
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,740
Look.

708
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,260
The doctor also doesn't think so.

709
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,300
Of course.

710
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,780
Civil servants can't engage or participate in

711
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,020
any profit-making activities.

712
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,020
Yes.

713
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,420
You don't have to open it.

714
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,590
Then I'll return the house.

715
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,900
For what?

716
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,050
We don't allow you to drive an online car.

717
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,480
You don't have to break up with us.

718
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,940
Who said that?

719
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,980
My mom went to Dali.

720
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,250
My house is empty.

721
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,860
Your house is so far away.

722
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,500
It's more convenient to live here, right?

723
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,180
Yes, Xia Jie.

724
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,220
Is something wrong with you?

725
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm fine.

726
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,980
I'm back.

727
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,110
Are you short of money?

728
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,620
No.

729
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,670
Xia Jie, if something wrong with you,

730
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,820
don't argue with me.

731
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,300
If you short of money,

732
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,660
don't pay your rent for now.

733
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,540
Or you can give it to me

734
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,490
when you have money.

735
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,530
It's okay, Xia Jie.

736
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,610
I still have some money.

737
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,900
I'll pay the rent for you next month.

738
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,910
No need.

739
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,020
I rented this house.

740
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,500
After all, I'll cover for you.

741
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,980
Yeah.

742
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,310
Xia Jie, tell us

743
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,300
how much you need.

744
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,020
There's strength in numbers.

745
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,530
Dawei and I will definitely help.

746
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,820
If you need money,

747
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,860
I can...

748
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,490
I can also save you some.

749
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,580
Xia Jie, look.

750
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,020
Such a stingy person is willing to lend you money.

751
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,320
Just stay here.

752
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,700
Who are you calling stingy?

753
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,340
Don't you admit it?

754
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
How am I stingy?

755
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,420
Look at you.

756
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,420
Stop it, Dawei.

757
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,860
Xia Jie, look how lively they are.

758
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,340
We are so happy to live together.

759
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,260
Really?

760
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,380
Am I wrong?

761
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,340
Then why did I hear Zhao Jiwei say

762
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,740
you were looking at the doctorate student recruitment?

763
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,970
That's because my master.

764
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,580
Now I understand.

765
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,220
Things depend on how I see.

766
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,420
If I always calculate

767
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,380
whose credit it is,

768
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,620
then it'll really be a competition.

769
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,260
As a policeman,

770
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,300
the most important thing is to solve problems for the people.

771
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Stop. The rest doesn't matter.

772
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,090
Peace. Stop.

773
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,060
You two finally know to stop.

774
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,010
He started it.

775
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,420
Alright, stop it.

776
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,940
I don't drive an online car or move out.

777
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,820
Okay?

778
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,740
Shut up!

779
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,320
Li Dawei!

780
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,920
Do you want to die?

781
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,220
Li Dawei, stop!

782
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,060
Stop!

783
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,460
Stop her! Stop her! Stop her!

784
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,900
Chief Cheng.

785
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:56,540
Hello.

786
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,620
It's finally over.

787
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,340
Dr. Wu's case is over.

788
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,780
Master.

789
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,950
I know you're doing this for my own good

790
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,860
and worried about me.

791
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,620
But since I put on this uniform,

792
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,900
I should assume all the responsibilities

793
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,300
of the police

794
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,020
and experience what I have to experience.

795
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,380
You protect me so much.

796
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,020
Jie.

797
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,460
I protect you for nothing else.

798
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,660
Because you are my apprentice.

799
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,540
If Li Dawei

800
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,820
or Zhao Jiwei is your apprentice today,

801
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,940
would you

802
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,540
also take everything on yourself like this?

803
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,820
It depends.

804
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,170
After all, they are boys.

805
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,960
Master, stop teasing me.

806
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,330
As police,

807
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,800
there's no difference between boys and girls.

808
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,620
If I really thought of myself as a girl,

809
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,900
I wouldn't have come to the police station

810
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,510
or wear this uniform.

811
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,010
Master, just think of me

812
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,980
as an ordinary policeman

813
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,730
like Li Dawei and Zhao Jiwei.

814
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,780
OK?

815
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,900
Okay, get in the car.

816
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,570
Stop fighting!

817
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,580
Stop.

818
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,050
Still fighting when the police are here?

819
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,320
- He started it.
- Put your hands down.

820
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,240
Don't move.

821
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,820
Don't move.

822
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,970
That guy is cheating.

823
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,570
Put away your phone.

824
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,540
Thank you. Don't look around.

825
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,220
Don't move.

826
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,050
Ding, look.

827
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,750
OK.

828
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,550
Dawei, Dawei, wait.

829
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,110
Stop filming.

830
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,470
There's nothing to film. Stop filming.

831
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,390
Dawei, let him get up.

832
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,090
Go have fun. Go.

833
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,570
Master.

834
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,450
I've thought you liked it

835
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,060
and wanted to improve the food by buying a hamburger.

836
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,300
Why did you buy a bowl of noodles?

837
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,140
I like them both.

838
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,010
I want to eat noodles today.

839
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,380
I want noodles too.

840
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Master, then you eat this.

841
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,980
I can eat the hamburger.

842
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,140
Forget it. Don't you like it?

843
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,830
Let's eat first.

844
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,659
I'll split it in half later,

845
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,179
and then let's exchange.

846
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,830
Okay.

847
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,860
Done.

848
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,940
What's wrong with young people nowadays?

849
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,380
They always fight.

850
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:23,980
Dawei,

851
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,710
don't be too aggressive.

852
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,199
Look, so many phones are filming.

853
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,330
No matter what,

854
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,739
they can't hurt my master.

855
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,699
Fine, let's go.

856
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
[Lanting Pavilion]

857
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,920
Lanting Pavilion.

858
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,889
It's a pretty elegant name.

859
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,219
But don't know what it's for.

860
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,860
It sounds like a tea house for drinking tea.

861
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,139
Yang Shu.

862
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,940
This is the time to highlight personal experience.

863
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,860
This place is called a club,

864
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,010
but it's actually an erotic place.

865
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
An erotic place?

866
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820
So publicly opened?

867
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,070
Why didn't crackdown it?

868
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,740
There's no evidence.

869
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,690
This place is not for ordinary people.

870
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,820
Membership system.

871
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,940
A membership card costs millions.

872
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,620
Then you have to earn tens of millions or even hundreds of millions.

873
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,360
Even if you have tens of millions,

874
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,060
you can't get in without an acquaintance.

875
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,260
Rich people don't need to make it so complicated

876
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,650
for eating, drinking and chatting.

877
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,170
Master.

878
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,980
the basic legal philosophy of modern society

879
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,900
is the presumption of innocence.

880
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,610
You can't say it's an erotic place

881
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,360
when don't know what's going on inside.

882
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,100
You...

883
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,820
are really a nerd.

884
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,750
That's it, master.

885
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,500
Let's exchange.

886
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,540
Just wait.

887
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,620
I'll find the evidence for you sooner or later.

888
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,250
Hello.

889
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,300
What is it?

890
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,610
Step aside.

891
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,640
Okay.

892
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,420
Wait a minute.

893
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,420
Wait a minute.

894
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,060
Tell me, what happened?

895
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,460
Louder.

896
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,100
Alright.

897
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,450
I'll be right there.

898
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,620
Master, what's up?

899
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,170
Just drive.

900
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,460
I'll give you a ride first if you need.

901
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,140
I'm wearing a police uniform.

902
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,920
Tell me if you really need anything.

903
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,270
See what I can do to help.

904
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,700
Why are you so full of crap?

905
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,590
Can you drive or not?

906
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,540
I will if you can't.

907
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,900
Master, where are you going?

908
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,820
Do you need my company?

909
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,460
No.

910
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,540
Chief Gao is on duty for me.

911
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,610
Just follow him.

912
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,370
Go.

913
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,540
What's going on? What is it

914
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,780
that we have to meet and talk?

915
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,540
What's wrong with you?

916
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,460
Why are you crying?

917
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,010
Did something happen to Jia?

918
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,420
Say something!

919
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,370
How dare you question me?

920
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,550
Have you ever done your duty as a father?

921
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,500
We're divorced.

922
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,210
You can leave me alone.

923
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,390
But you should care more about the kid.

924
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,140
Shang Zhen.

925
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,380
Did you call me out in the middle of the night

926
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,540
just to settle old scores with me?

927
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,820
What happened?

928
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,340
Did something happen to Jia?

929
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,820
She learned to draw well before.

930
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,420
The kids who learn to draw with her

931
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,100
are paid by their fathers

932
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,740
and taught by the best painter.

933
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,780
I can't afford a good painter.

934
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,700
But I can afford private lessons.

935
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,190
I also hired for her.

936
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,500
She suddenly said she didn't want to learn

937
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,610
after a few lessons

938
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,060
and asked me to return the money.

939
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,020
Why?

940
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,420
How would I know?

941
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,660
Don't you know your daughter is so rebellious?

942
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,740
Two days ago in the Jiefang Road overpass

943
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,810
I saw her too.

944
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,860
She was with a strange man.

945
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,610
She had a fancy makeup

946
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,890
and ran away when she saw me.

947
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,140
I wanted to ask you why.

948
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,010
I gave her a lot of money

949
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,610
but she refused.

950
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,900
She said she wanted to earn money to support herself.

951
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,450
Can you blame her?

952
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Jia has grown up and learned lessons.

953
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,820
She doesn't want to use your money.

954
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,860
Although I'm not as rich as you,

955
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,780
I'm her father.

956
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,260
I can't afford private lessons.

957
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,220
But I can afford the tuition class.

958
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,780
At worst, I'll sell everything.

959
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,380
Sell everything?

960
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,540
How many things do you have?

961
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
That's my business.

962
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,870
Did she say how to make money?

963
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,620
She's so young. She knows nothing.

964
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,090
She's going to be the atmosphere host.

965
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,460
Host what?

966
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,010
It's to drink with people in the bar.

967
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,310
What... What did you say?

968
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,230
It's to drink with men.

969
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,100
Are you crazy?

970
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,260
Is this how you're a mother?

971
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,540
Are you still her mother?

972
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,740
Can she make that money?

973
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,340
What can I do?

974
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,260
I cried and scolded her.

975
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,980
But she didn't listen. She insisted on going.

976
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,340
Which club is she at?

977
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,530
Which club!

978
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,980
Get off.

979
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,370
Why are you yelling at me?

980
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,130
Get off. I'm going to find my daughter.

981
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,140
Jia.

982
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,020
What are you doing here?

983
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,620
Just to drink with the guest. You don't need to do anything else.

984
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,820
That man is very rich.

985
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,020
Make him happy tonight.

986
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,200
There are a lots of tips.

987
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,250
Bro Li.

988
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:08,820
Come here.

989
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,590
Right away.

990
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,980
I'll drink with you first.

991
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,300
Let's go home.

992
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,010
What are you doing?

993
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,740
Go!

994
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,830
What are you doing?

995
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,570
Jia, what are you doing?

996
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,900
Do you want your dad to die?

997
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,260
What are you doing? Let go!

998
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,180
I'm working.

999
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,860
Work?

1000
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,380
You work in such a mess place?

1001
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,690
Don't be ridiculous. Let's go.

1002
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,300
Bro.

1003
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,980
Go!

1004
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,660
Bro.

1005
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,380
I'll arrange a better one for you.

1006
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:43,900
Who are you?

1007
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,740
Someone ordered her.

1008
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,010
Order? Who ordered her?

1009
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,540
Let's go.

1010
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,140
What are you doing?

1011
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,940
Are you going to take people away from me?

1012
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,300
Who are you? Take your hands off!

1013
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:49,940
Security!

1014
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Where are you going?

1015
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,260
Do you know who I am?

1016
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,980
Get out of the way!

1017
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,540
Get out of the way! Go.
