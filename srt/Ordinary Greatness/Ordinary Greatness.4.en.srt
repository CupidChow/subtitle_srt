5
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,990
Master.

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,750
For the two people who hit bikes and fought on the street,

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,090
should we detain them or not?

8
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,970
Do you just know detain people?

9
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,780
It's fun to catch people, isn't it?

10
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,740
Go get some water.

11
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,919
Master,

12
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,060
I'll add some goji berries for you.

13
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,590
I asked you to refill the water.

14
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,890
Cut the crap.

15
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,520
Master, it's hot.

16
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,610
Master, you're still wearing long sleeves

17
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,790
even if you are so hot.

18
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,910
It's summer.

19
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,300
Can't you leave me alone?

20
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,420
Can you stop talking? I beg you.

21
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,050
Go to bring them in.

22
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,180
Let's go.

23
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,580
The room on the right side.

24
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,980
Sit over there.

25
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,660
Get lost!

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,880
Why don't you get lost?

27
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,580
What's going on?

28
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,490
Stop arguing.

29
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,710
Stop arguing.

30
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,329
Let me tell you.

31
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,740
Here,

32
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,420
unless I agree,

33
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,860
no one is allowed to speak.

34
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,160
Two men.

35
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,950
It was fine to hit the bikes with each other.

36
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,040
You even fought with each other.

37
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,260
Tell me about it.

38
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,610
Officer,

39
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,940
it's because he's a good-for-nothing.

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Who are you talking about?

41
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,630
You!

42
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,410
Who is a jerk?

43
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:35,940
What?

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,430
You're a jerk.

45
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,020
Shut up!

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,850
You're really...

47
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,860
How could you say that?

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,790
Can you show some respect?

49
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,780
Respect? To him?

50
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,420
Bah!

51
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,180
-You deserve it! -You are still arguing. Shut up!

52
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,940
Shut up.

53
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,540
Didn't you hear what Officer Chen had said?

54
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,250
Did he let you talk?

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,240
Did he let you talk?

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,900
Yes, did he ask you to speak?

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:07,890
Brother Chen.

58
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,420
What is it?

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,920
Mr. Sun from the parking lot of Shangding Neighborhood

60
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,029
called just now.

61
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,660
He said the two robbers might show up

62
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,899
what we asked him to keep an eye on them.

63
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,300
I told you to speak instead of quarreling.

64
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,460
Quiet!

65
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,020
Stop arguing!

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,090
Stop arguing. Can't you stop?

67
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,330
No. What do you mean?

68
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,360
Did they show up or not?

69
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,600
Mr. Sun's words are vague.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
I'm not sure.

71
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,900
What’s wrong, master?

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,400
Qiancheng, you lead the way later

73
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,480
and take Li Dawei to check the situation.

74
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,020
You mainly check the place where they live.

75
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,790
Didn't they leave early before?

76
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,220
Let's go to check it out

77
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,490
like a patrol.

78
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,620
Remember.

79
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,820
No matter whether the matter is true or not,

80
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,140
call me first.

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,950
No problem.

82
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,860
Even if something happens, don't act rashly.

83
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,770
Do you hear me?

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,980
Do you hear me?

85
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,570
Okay.

86
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,180
You take care of him later.

87
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,130
Okay, you guys go.

88
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,700
Yes.

89
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,300
Go back.

90
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,260
Stop watching. The car is here.

91
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,180
The car is here.

92
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,020
The police are here.

93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,430
Officer,

94
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,140
you look upstairs that

95
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,440
someone is going to jump off the building.

96
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,500
Yes, we are the property management.

97
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,500
Here. Where?

98
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
This way, upstairs.

99
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,620
The kid has been wandering on the roof for a long time.

100
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,540
He hasn't come down yet.

101
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,630
Didn't they say he's good at studying?

102
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,580
He's a boy.

103
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,260
Yes.

104
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,270
Let's go there and take a look.

105
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,980
Yang Shu.

106
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,980
Make way.

107
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,900
Excuse me.

108
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,820
Make way, please.

109
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,580
Step back!

110
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,900
Make way, please.

111
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,620
Make way.

112
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,740
They all live in this building?

113
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,420
Not all of them. Some people are bystanders.

114
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,350
Let them disperse.

115
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,180
Okay.

116
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,900
Guard the gate.

117
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,730
Don't let idle people in again.

118
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,300
Okay.

119
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,860
Step back. Step back.

120
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,180
Master,

121
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,420
should we wait for the firemen to arrive first and take action?

122
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,980
We need to check the situation first.

123
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,140
-But we should wait until... -Have you never seen this situation before?

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Or do you have the fear of heights?

125
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,740
No, I'm not.

126
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,920
Remember.

127
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,930
All policemen must overcome the fear.

128
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,020
Follow me later.

129
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,900
You graduated from a 985 university.

130
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,980
Then why are you working as an assistant policeman?

131
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,540
It's because I need to take civil service examination

132
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,140
since I cross-professionally the major to be a policeman. I failed in the exam.

133
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
Thus I become the assistant policeman first

134
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,700
and take the exam again.

135
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,350
The salary of being an assistant is much lower than being a policeman, right?

136
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,780
Not bad.

137
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,930
It's less than

138
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,900
3,000 yuan a month.

139
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,540
Less than 3,000 yuan?

140
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,340
How can you live?

141
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,250
Sun, what do you want?

142
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,700
I just want to be a policeman.

143
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,780
Since I was a child,

144
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,050
if I could become an official cop in my lifetime,

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,270
I would die in peace.

146
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,420
Don't talk nonsense.

147
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,140
Does it sound a little silly?

148
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,660
But I do have some sort of heroic relationship.

149
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,130
You are not stupid.

150
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,780
I understand, really.

151
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,250
In this peaceful era,

152
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,180
which job can make the hero dream come true?

153
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,220
Isn't that being a police officer?

154
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,420
You've also always wanted to be a policeman since you were a child?

155
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,900
If these words come from my mouth,

156
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,100
I will be a bit shameless.

157
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,860
My grades are bad since I was a kid.

158
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,780
But I can always be a cadre.

159
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,020
Do you know why?

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,820
Everyone knows that I'm nice

161
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,660
and warm-hearted.

162
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,220
I love to help others.

163
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,730
My classmates always ask me for help.

164
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,100
Let me tell you.

165
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,090
I even got a medal for helping others.

166
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,780
When it was time to take the exam,

167
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,980
my mom saw the situation

168
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,950
and said it was good for you to go to the police academy.

169
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,110
At worst,

170
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,220
the teachers in the police academy can discipline me.

171
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,970
Right?

172
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,260
Sometimes I think

173
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
what we do all day long

174
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,820
is like a rag of society.

175
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,460
Where can I achieve my hero dream?

176
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,770
If you think like this,

177
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,059
you will feel a little disappointed.

178
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,539
But it doesn't matter.

179
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,659
We are young.

180
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,700
We have plenty of opportunities.

181
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,740
Opportunities are for those people who are prepared.

182
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,490
Right?

183
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,540
Alright, stop looking.

184
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,340
Make way.

185
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,140
I'm acting as a father and a mother to raise you up.

186
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,460
I give you whatever you want.

187
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,260
I also provided you to go to college in Beijing

188
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,940
till graduate school.

189
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,060
Now,

190
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,300
I only have a small request for you.

191
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,140
-Master. -I hope we...

192
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,900
When will the firefighters arrive?

193
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,570
We can live together smoothly forever.

194
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,690
Stop shouting. Stop shouting.

195
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,420
Yuhao.

196
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,700
Are you the child’s mother?

197
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,460
Yes.

198
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,060
Everyone, don’t stay around here.

199
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,940
Yuhao. Be good. Come down quickly.

200
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,780
Yuhao.

201
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,380
If you’re not his family, step back a little.

202
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,020
Yuhao.

203
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Why?

204
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,300
Go. Stop looking.

205
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,100
I don't know why.

206
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,020
When I came back from grocery shopping,

207
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,940
he was already here.

208
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,780
What happened between you two

209
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,220
before your grocery shopping?

210
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,140
You have to tell me so that

211
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,740
we can save your son.

212
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,220
We just had a fight.

213
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,060
Because of what?

214
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,650
What could the mother and son fight about?

215
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,020
We're usually like this.

216
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,940
But this time,

217
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,110
he threatened me with his death.

218
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,940
Lower your voice.

219
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,580
Yuhao, you just want to jump, right?

220
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,300
Okay.

221
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,140
I'll jump with you.

222
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,660
At least we can die together.

223
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,700
Don't come over.

224
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,260
No.

225
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,380
We won't.

226
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Don't move.

227
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,850
Don't come over.

228
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,670
Be careful.

229
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,620
No, we won't.

230
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,020
Calm down.

231
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,860
Calm down.

232
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,500
Calm down.

233
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,980
I don't want to live anymore.

234
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,100
Do you want to see

235
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,220
your son die in front of you?

236
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,500
Don't move.

237
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,350
If you don't want to see him die,

238
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,580
you won't provoke him anymore.

239
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,250
Can’t we talk about it later?

240
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,820
Yuhao.

241
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,710
Take her away.

242
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,740
Auntie, you go first.

243
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,820
Yuhao.

244
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,700
Okay. Okay.

245
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,740
Please leave first.

246
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,460
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

247
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,540
Yuhao.

248
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,420
We’re not going there.

249
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,290
What are the police doing here?

250
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:00,950
This way.

251
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,140
Every time I come here,

252
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,420
I feel like I'm in a maze.

253
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
Brother, you're here.

254
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,320
Min.

255
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,220
Yuhao, right?

256
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,220
I heard from your mom that

257
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,140
you just came back from Beijing.

258
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,220
Don't come over.

259
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,530
No, I won't.

260
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,580
But I'm a police officer.

261
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,100
I have the obligation to protect your life.

262
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,780
You can leave.

263
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,270
I don't need you to protect my life.

264
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,380
I don't need anyone to protect my life.

265
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,220
I have the responsibility to protect everyone's life.

266
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,340
You should protect a valuable person.

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,850
Aren't you just a valuable life?

268
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,100
No, I'm worthless.

269
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,660
I’m just a puppet now.

270
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,340
Yuhao,

271
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,900
you’re going to finish from graduate school, right?

272
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,460
How much longer do you think your mom can take care of you?

273
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,260
So what can I do after graduation?

274
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,740
She won't let me go.

275
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,580
Of course not.

276
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,340
My mom loves to take care of me too.

277
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,500
But I don't listen to her anymore.

278
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,140
I haven't contacted her for years.

279
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,210
Really?

280
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,980
Yes.

281
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,140
Ask him if you don’t believe me. My apprentice.

282
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,180
Yuhao.

283
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,210
It’s true.

284
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,020
Not only my master does it.

285
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,900
So do I.

286
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,820
I studied in Beijing too.

287
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,360
I also graduated with my master's degree.

288
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,550
But since I was a child,

289
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,660
my mom would scold me

290
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,830
when I was the second place in the exam.

291
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,100
Even if I went to Peking University

292
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,740
and I had the master's degree,

293
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,780
my mom still scolded me.

294
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,620
It’s the same.

295
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,810
Yuhao.

296
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,580
Yuhao.

297
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,330
I really understand you.

298
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,340
Really.

299
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,820
Don't move.

300
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,000
What happened later?

301
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,490
After I graduated,

302
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,810
I left Beijing

303
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,620
and left my home,

304
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,700
and I came here.

305
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,370
I'm a police officer at the police station.

306
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,100
Do you hear his words?

307
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,400
He’s also a postgraduate.

308
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,940
Yuhao.

309
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,350
As a man,

310
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,490
there are many ways to get rid of the parents' control.

311
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,450
You can find a job that she doesn't like

312
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,140
or get married with a daughter-in-law that she doesn't like.

313
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,050
They all work.

314
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,340
We all made it.

315
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,780
You can make it too.

316
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,860
I can't.

317
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,250
I can't get rid of it. I can't.

318
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,220
You all heard it.

319
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,410
She would rather die with me

320
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,220
than let me go.

321
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,640
Don't think like that.

322
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,990
Only death

323
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,280
can get everything be settled.

324
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,290
Wait. Yuhao.

325
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,330
What?

326
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,390
They are leaving.

327
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,480
Let's call Cheng first.

328
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,790
No need. They have almost gone.

329
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,710
It's not appropriate for just the two of us.

330
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,680
-It breaks the rules. -It's too late.

331
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,660
Call Cheng.

332
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,050
Sun Qiancheng, how is it?

333
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,260
I found them.

334
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,540
What Li Dawei means

335
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,650
is that the two of us can catch them.

336
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,520
What? Then you should stop him.

337
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,380
It's too late.

338
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,140
Hello?

339
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,940
Put him away first.

340
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,570
I'll be back soon.

341
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,140
Okay.

342
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,020
You catch the skinny one.

343
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,820
Leave the strong one to me.

344
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,130
Police! Stop!

345
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,930
Police!

346
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,100
Stop!

347
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,720
Stop!

348
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,010
Stop! Police!

349
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,620
Stop!

350
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:35,980
Stop!

351
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,060
Brother, your hand...

352
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,800
Sun Qiancheng, what did I say?

353
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,980
The opportunities are for those people who are prepared.

354
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,260
Call my master

355
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,050
and tell him that the mission is solved.

356
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,050
Step back.

357
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,660
Don't jump.

358
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,740
Young man, be careful.

359
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,180
There are so many people down there.

360
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,380
If you jump and hit someone,

361
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,970
you'll hurt the innocent.

362
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,420
Don't jump.

363
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,710
You ask them to hide, okay?

364
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,370
Okay, I'll let them go now.

365
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,570
Don't come over.

366
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,780
I won't.

367
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,780
I just want to tell them

368
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
not to get hurt by you, okay?

369
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,900
Make way.

370
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,100
Be careful. Step back.

371
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,180
Make way!

372
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,510
Stop filming. Make way.

373
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,500
Make way.

374
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,500
Everything is ready.

375
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,440
Yes.

376
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Once started, the car will be here.

377
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,380
Xia Jie, you don't move.

378
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,420
Wait here.

379
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,820
Listen to my order.

380
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,980
Qizi, you stay with her.

381
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,520
Okay.

382
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,770
Move!

383
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,020
Freeze!

384
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,900
Police!

385
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,700
Freeze!

386
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,810
Why are you so active?

387
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,720
Stop! Stop!

388
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,450
Freeze! Freeze!

389
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,320
Don't move!

390
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,660
For prostitution and whoring, the evidence is the hardest one to get.

391
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,890
When you go in,

392
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,140
they press a button.

393
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,300
When you get there,

394
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,500
everything will be fine.

395
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,780
This is the only way.

396
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,470
They can't escape this time.

397
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,180
Officer Cao, thank you.

398
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
Thank you so much.

399
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,140
-Thank you. -It's what I should do.

400
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,590
Thank you.

401
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,290
Thank you.

402
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,860
-It's my duty. -Thank you.

403
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,950
Thank you, Officer Cao.

404
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
You are a real hero.

405
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,580
This is what we should do.

406
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Thank you, Officer Cao.

407
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,260
Thank you.

408
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,020
It's nothing.

409
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,180
Thank you, police.

410
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,980
Thank you.

411
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,940
Thank you, police.

412
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,100
You're welcome.

413
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,630
Officer Cao, we meet again.

414
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,820
You are the hero in my heart.

415
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,730
Thank you, everyone.

416
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,700
Thank you.

417
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,820
It's okay. This is what we should do.

418
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,370
Great job! Great job!

419
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,250
Get in.

420
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,440
Get up.

421
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,130
-Thank you. -You are welcome.

422
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,840
Thank you.

423
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,980
Brother, your hand.

424
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,050
It's okay.

425
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,100
Wrap it up.

426
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,050
Catch and grapple.

427
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,000
This is the basic skill

428
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,230
in the police academy.

429
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,630
Just these two thieves.

430
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,960
985 university admires you.

431
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
I'll do it by myself.

432
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,090
You wrap it up more tightly.

433
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,230
It's fine to wrap it up randomly.

434
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,180
Let's go.

435
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,140
Go. Get in the car.

436
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,470
Get in.

437
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,180
Where is Li Dawei?

438
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,280
Master, we caught them.

439
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,860
Move!

440
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,420
Hurry!

441

[Team 7's body worn camera]

442
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,350
Hurry up.

443
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,890
Take him to the car.

444
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,060
Police, I didn't do anything.

445
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,930
I was just passing by.

[Team 7's body worn camera]

447
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,380
I have nothing.

448
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,460
Stop dawdling.

449
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,770
Get in the car.

450
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,180
Stop dawdling.

451
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,060
Hurry up.

452
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,770
I work here.

453
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,070
Let's go.

454
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,730
Hurry up. Lower your head.

455
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,800
Stop dawdling.

456
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,550
Hurry up. Get in the car.

457
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,170
Take him to the car.

458
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,430
Hurry up.

459
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,380
No, officer.

460
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,900
-Go. -You.

461
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,460
Get in the car quickly.

462
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,420
Officer, it's none of my business.

463
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm just a part-timer.

464
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,180
Let's talk at the police station.

465
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,550
My child is so young. You...

466
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,740
Qizi, just in time.

467
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,820
Come and take this kid away.

468
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,220
Ask his family's contact information

469
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,280
and let them pick up the child.

470
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,050
Chief Cheng, I can do it.

471
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,300
Are you sure?

472
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,180
Fine, go ahead.

473
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,460
You help to escort him.

474
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,860
Don't cry.

475
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,860
What's your name?

476
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,690
Wang Shuaixiao.

477
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,500
Officer, my name is Xiang Cuihua.

478
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,580
I'm just a part-timer.

479
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,420
I know nothing.

480
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm innocent.

481
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,300
Let go!

482
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,970
Call your family

483
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,750
to pick up the kid quickly.

484
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,380
Dismiss.

485
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,280
Come on.

486
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,740
Why didn't you pick a nice place to work in?

487
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,100
Is this a place for kids to come?

488
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,160
No, officer.

489
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,270
My child is so young.

490
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,940
No place wants to hire me

491
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,220
since the child is together with me.

492
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,780
We can't earn much money

493
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
to do farm work in the village.

494
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,260
The whole family is waiting to eat.

495
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,890
I have no choice.

496
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,850
Can you give me a way out, okay?

497
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,180
I also have no choice.

498
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,260
Forget it. We won't wrong a good person.

499
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,030
But you must go back with us

500
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,460
to explain the situation and cooperate in the investigation.

501
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,390
You can come back

502
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,300
only if the investigation can prove you are innocent.

503
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,330
No, Officer.

504
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,300
You see my baby is so young.

505
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,090
What will she do if I go to the station?

506
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,700
Is there anyone else in your family?

507
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,860
Ask them to pick up the kid.

508
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:31,940
Don't worry.

509
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,250
If you are innocent,

510
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,330
you can come out right away.

511
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,940
But now you have to tell me

512
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,160
who can take care of her these days.

513
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,110
Hurry up. Let's go.

514
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,660
I have a husband.

515
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
But my child is so young.

516
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,930
She can't live without me.

517
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,060
I can't let her go in with you.

518
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,950
Tell me your husband's phone number

519
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,670
Xia Jie, any questions?

520
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,890
No problem.

521
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,470
I'll call her husband to pick up the child.

522
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,660
Officer.

523
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,290
Okay, let's go back by car.

524
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,620
Qian, Zhi Gang.

525
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,900
You two stay here

526
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,980
to accompany Xia Jie.

527
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,590
Take her back after you finish asking questions.

528
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,980
Be careful.

529
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,540
Hurry up.

530
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,730
135.

531
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,580
1125.

532
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,660
Okay. Stop crying.

533
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,460
It will be fine to just go to the station and explain the situation.

534
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,620
Officer,

535
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,940
I can tell you're a good person.

536
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,900
You don't know...

537
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,530
Shut up.

538
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,240
Zhi Gang, let her talk.

539
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,450
I've been in the city for less than three years.

540
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,340
I was tricked several times.

541
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,900
In the first year,

542
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,540
I worked hard for a year,

543
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,960
but I didn't even save money to go home.

544
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,750
I even wanted to jump off the river.

545
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,100
Stop making up stories.

546
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,560
I'm not lying. I'm telling the truth.

547
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,020
I even moved bricks at the construction site.

548
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,900
One brick only can earn 5 cents.

549
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,330
I have to move more than one thousand bricks a day.

550
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,420
My hands are worn out.

551
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,620
I thought I could save some money.

552
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,170
But when I was paying the bill,

553
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,780
the foreman deducted half of me.

554
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,950
He also said you brought your daughter with you.

555
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,250
Your daughter is considered as a person's living expense.

556
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,860
He tricked me so heavily.

557
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,990
If my family finds out I work there,

558
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,360
I'll have no way to live.

559
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,110
I had no choice.

560
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,400
Other places don't want to hire me.

561
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,460
Come down. Behave yourself.

562
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,580
Sun.

563
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,070
Take them to the back side first.

564
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,860
Okay.

565
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,820
Thank you.

566
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,580
It's okay, brother.

567
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,330
Master, let me help Sun.

568
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,460
The strong person is tough.

569
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,780
Do you want to die?

570
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,290
What's wrong with me?

571
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,860
What's wrong?

572
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,780
What's wrong with you?

573
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,780
You just made up your mind to me, right?

574
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,380
Do as I say.

575
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,280
If you have anything to report, you will report to your master first,

576
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,990
right?

577
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,400
What did I tell you before you went out?

578
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,600
I told you many times

579
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,150
again and again, right?

580
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,180
I let you get to know if the situation

581
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,060
is accurate or not.

582
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,340
No matter what happens,

583
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,780
you shouldn't take action

584
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,060
and call me first.

585
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,260
Have all these things been mixed

586
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,780
with northwest wind and eaten off?

587
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,900
No, that's true.

588
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,740
But each of them had a box on their hands at that moment

589
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,900
and they were about to run away.

590
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,540
It'll be too late if we don't catch them at that time.

591
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,090
You want to be a hero?

592
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,570
You want to make achievements?

593
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

594
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,580
If you want to make achievements, you can go to find someone else to be your master.

595
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,740
Why did you bring troubles to me?

596
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,080
He's holding a knife, you know?

597
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,820
He has a knife,

598
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,980
but he is far away from you.

599
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,210
Even if he wants to stab you, he can't reach you.

600
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,720
What are you afraid of?

601
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:20,940
Say it again.

602
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,420
Li Dawei.

603
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,440
Get up here!

604
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,860
And you, come up here.

605
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,750
Who are you calling?

606
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,380
Besides, if I can roll down,

607
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,570
how can I roll up?

608
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,780
The director asked you to roll up.

609
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,660
What conditions do you want to discuss?

610
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,500
Roll up!

611
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,870
Yang Shu.

612
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,580
What did you do?

613
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,580
I don't know.

614
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,800
My master and I just saved someone.

615
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,740
What a coincidence.

616
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,290
We just caught one.

617
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,700
We can't save people

618
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,650
or catch people.

619
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,940
What should the police do?

620
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,730
Close the door.

621
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,300
Stand over there.

622
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,330
Don't stand in front of me.

623
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,780
Turn around.

624
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,020
I don't want to see your faces.

625
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,460
Seeing your faces makes my blood pressure higher.

626
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,700
Your master?

627
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,040
Whose master?

628
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Your master.

629
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,490
You talk too much. Who is your master?

630
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
If you don't inform your master

631
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,500
and take actions without permission,

632
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,380
do you want to be a hero?

633
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,300
Let me tell you.

634
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,940
Your master was much more like a hero than you.

635
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,820
That year,

636
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,560
a girl wanted to jump off the building.

637
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,780
Your master encountered the case

638
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,570
and rushed up regardless of his safety.

639
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,940
And he grabbed that girl desperately.

640
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,010
But what about that girl?

641
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
She's determined to die.

642
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,250
She struggled desperately in his hands.

643
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,490
But your master

644
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,100
dragged her desperately.

645
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,900
Bones on his elbow

646
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,700
can be seen

647
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,980
by rubbing on the floor.

648
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,660
He insisted around 20 minutes.

649
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,300
And he couldn't hold her anymore.

650
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,740
That girl fell off

651
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,450
from your master's hands.

652
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,560
What happened later?

653
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,940
The girl's family said

654
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,140
it was your master's fault

655
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,140
who caused the girl's death.

656
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,660
So they sued it everywhere.

657
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,260
In the end,

658
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,610
the bureau gave your master a punishment

659
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,120
and compensated a lot of money

660
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,620
to her family.

661
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,260
Then the matter was over.

662
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,060
Your master

663
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,170
was more enthusiastic

664
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,540
and more aggressive than you.

665
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,420
But now,

666
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,580
his heart has been cold for a big part of it.

667
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,070
He hasn’t recovered yet till now.

668
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,250
Li Dawei,

669
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,980
why don't you

670
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,360
listen to your master?

671
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,350
Why didn’t you follow orders?

672
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,270
Chief.

673
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,050
It was too late to report the situation.

674
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,750
No matter how urgent the situation was,

675
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,990
you should have a way to deal with it.

676
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,390
Your master asked you to call for help

677
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,680
to protect you.

678
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,740
Do you know that?

679
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,540
It's best

680
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,160
to be four against one when catching people.

681
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,350
At least three to one.

682
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,260
At least it should be two against one.

683
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,540
Look at you.

684
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,370
You went up alone.

685
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,780
Who is he?

686
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,260
He's a habitual offender.

687
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,660
He can do anything.

688
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,340
If he stabbed you to death,

689
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,820
what about the police station?

690
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,940
Why are you making me worry?

691
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,790
Chief, if I die,

692
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,100
I won't trouble the police.

693
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,840
Nonsense.

694
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,540
Is your life yours?

695
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,170
If you die,

696
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,400
what about your parents?

697
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,220
If I'm afraid of death,

698
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,650
how can I be a policeman?

699
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,100
Besides, I'm fine.

700
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,010
It's okay.

701
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,290
Put your hands up.

702
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,020
Why did you wrap your hands?

703
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,650
You are not alone.

704
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,140
You also have Sun Qiancheng.

705
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,460
What if the person also had a knife in his hand

706
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,460
who Sun Qiancheng faced?

707
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,690
He is an assistant

708
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,450
who only has 2,000 yuan a month.

709
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,560
Do you want him to die?

710
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,380
Do you know why we need to assign masters for you?

711
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,900
We want to teach you

712
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,450
to protect yourselves first if you are a policeman.

713
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,050
If you can't even protect yourself,

714
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,910
how can you protect the people?

715
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,540
Personalism is not a hero,

716
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,610
which is a bear.

717
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,290
It's showing off.

718
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,350
Yang Shu, I know

719
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,050
it was your master's idea

720
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,420
to take action first before the firefighters arrive.

721
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,930
Chief, the situation at that time...

722
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,540
Fine.

723
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,180
I know

724
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,730
your master a lot.

725
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,250
Just like what I said

726
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,410
at the time of assigning masters.

727
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,620
Masters need to teach the apprentices the skills,

728
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,500
but they also need to learn from their apprentices.

729
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,420
Yang Shu, you are a top student in law school.

730
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,130
You came to our Balihe Police Station for your internship

731
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,620
to use your theory

732
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,920
and practice.

733
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,580
So I hope you two

734
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,790
can really

735
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,330
learn from each other.

736
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,340
If this happens again,

737
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,660
you just say that

738
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,580
it was my order.

739
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,140
Fine.

740
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,730
I've been a policeman for over 30 years.

741
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,170
I may not be a good cop,

742
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,139
but I'm definitely a good chief.

743
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,780
I've been telling my subordinates that

744
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,080
I would rather go to the confinement room

745
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,190
and deliver food for you every day.

746
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:24,860
But I don't want

747
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,100
to go to your grave every year.

748
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:31,350
If you make a mistake, you still have a chance to change.

749
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,300
If you lose your life,

750
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,659
you'll lose everything.

751
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,940
Understand?

752
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,550
Yes.

753
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,420
What if

754
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,770
we have to rush up?

755
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,659
When we have to rush up...

756
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:45,650
Xia Jie.

757
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,460
Xia Jie's father encountered the situation

758
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,650
that he had to rush up.

759
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,139
He rushed up and left.

760
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,659
Xia Jie and her mom

761
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,690
live a hard life.

762
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,380
Remember,

763
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,060
not only work hard for yourself,

764
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,970
but also cherish your life.

765
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
Understand?

766
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,980
Yes.

767
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,140
Yes.

768
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,460
Your master is really unlucky

769
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,340
with an apprentice like you.

770
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,660
Where is my phone?

771
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,780
It's in my bag.

772
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,220
Look.

773
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,460
This family is so cute.

774
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,410
We've saved a family.

775
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,500
So

776
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,580
it's not just a community job.

777
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,410
Look.

778
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,420
Master,

779
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,540
this is a big deal?

780
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,550
Are you arguing?

781
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,760
Fine, tell me.

782
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,610
Whose window is broken?

783
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,790
Is it a big deal or a small matter?

784
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,250
Master, you're being unreasonable.

785
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,590
If the glass is broken,

786
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,760
it must be a small matter.

787
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,190
Yes, it is.

788
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,360
But if you are not careful,

789
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,820
it will lead to a disaster.

790
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,640
A few years ago,

791
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,300
we have similar cases.

792
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,860
There was a

793
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,000
glass broken in that family's toilet window.

794
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,720
I reminded this family several times.

795
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,570
They were lazy and never changed.

796
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,690
One night,

797
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,820
someone went in through this broken window

798
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,930
He stole something,

799
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,220
and raped the hostess.

800
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,620
Do you think it is a big deal or a small matter?

801
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,990
So serious?

802
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,180
You think

803
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,790
our community is not that important.

804
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,500
We can only focus on our work first

805
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,210
to help the people

806
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,010
so that we can nip in the bud.

807
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,310
This matter.

808
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,310
It's enough for them to drink a pot.

809
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,430
What?

810
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,420
It's love to beat or scold.

811
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,620
Don't you know our chief?

812
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,010
He values these newbies.

813
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,090
Who are you talking about?

814
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,740
It's about the new guys.

815
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,470
Li Dawei and Little Doctor.

816
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,930
Well,

817
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,480
they are really capable.

818
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,940
One caught one person, and

819
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
one saved a person.

820
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,790
The chief is scolding them.

821
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,930
Jie, we go first.

822
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,550
Okay.

823
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,740
Master.

824
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,550
So they've made achievements, right?

825
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,810
Why are they being scolded?

826
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,000
They must take actions without permission

827
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,140
and put themselves in danger.

828
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,740
Master.

829
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,880
Behave yourselves! Squat!

830
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,150
Get down!

831
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,780
Don't communicate.

832
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,380
What’s your name?

833
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,260
Fang Xinyu.

834
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,720
Name and age.

835
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,060
My daughter is only seven years old.

836
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,490
My husband has never raised a child.

837
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,110
Get off.

838
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,420
Let me call him,

839
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,090
okay?

840
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,100
I can't help you with that.

841
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,530
You can't contact anyone

842
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,530
before the investigation is done.

843
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,250
-I will be worried if the kid is taken by him. -Get off the car.

844
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,940
Come down.

845
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,230
Or you can call him for me.

846
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,900
Come down.

847
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,420
My daughter is too young. She is only seven.

848
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,160
It's not that I don't want to help you.

849
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,110
It's the bureau's rule.

850
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,860
Please.

851
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,570
Go.

852
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,100
Can you call my husband for me?

853
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,040
Okay?

854
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,460
Please.

855
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,890
Can you call my husband for me?

856
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,530
Go.

857
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,750
Sister, please.

858
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,670
Call my husband.

859
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,300
Go.

860
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,900
Please.

861
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,740
What are you doing?

862
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,290
-Let go of me. -Go.

863
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,860
Go. Do you hear me?

864
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,780
They pretend to be pitiful and pretend to be miserable.

865
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,110
Officer Xia, don't believe it.

866
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,660
How long have you been here?

867
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,320
Squat down.

868
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,550
What did she say to you?

869
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,260
Master,

870
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,210
are we prejudiced

871
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,210
against the suspect?

872
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,050
It's not prejudice. It's experience.

873
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,020
You'll know what's going on

874
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,260
after you see more people like this one.

875
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,180
It's required to have a policewoman right there

876
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,420
for questioning a female suspect.

877
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,720
You go to get changed.

878
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,170
I'll wait for you in front of the interrogation room.

879
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,730
I didn't expect my master to be so pitiful.

880
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,170
Where is your master?

881
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,290
He's not back yet.

882
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,710
By the way,

883
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,210
how's the rental thing you mentioned last time?

884
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,980
Why do you ask?

885
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,210
I'm thinking about

886
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,210
the dorm's

887
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,370
beds are very tight.

888
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,100
It's good to rent a house.

889
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,670
We can consider it.

890
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,510
I thought I was assigned to the Municipal Bureau

891
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,950
and rented a house nearby.

892
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,200
Now I'm in Balihe

893
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,430
and I have returned the house.

894
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,940
I didn't have time to find a place.

895
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,860
I've been staying in a chain hotel.

896
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,750
Friends from Beijing are so luxurious.

897
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,020
I'm already looking for them.

898
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,690
I'll move in if I find a suitable one.

899
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,180
Then stop looking.

900
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,320
I have one.

901
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,310
Share it with me.

902
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,130
Share?

903
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,730
Why do you rent a house?

904
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,840
Isn't your house here?

905
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,960
In other words,

906
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,860
my mom was worried that I would work too far away

907
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,120
so she decided

908
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,650
rented me a three-bedroom apartment nearby

909
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,190
and rented one for you.

910
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,500
Isn't that luxury?

911
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,690
This is my mom.

912
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,710
She treats money like shit.

913
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,010
But she's not rich.

914
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,440
It's hard to make money.

915
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,340
I just want to rent with someone

916
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,900
to share the rent

917
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,310
and reduce her pressure.

918
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,450
It's a deal then.

919
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,590
Li Dawei, I admire you.

920
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,160
This is nothing.

921
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,380
There are many things to admire in the future.

922
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,870
I don't know what will happen in the future.

923
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:02,890
I just think

924
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,030
you are easy to be happy.

925
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,030
Do you mean I'm heartless?

926
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,410
I'm not saying you're heartless.

927
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,520
I mean you are optimistic.

928
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,350
We

929
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,270
have been educated differently since childhood.

930
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,190
I grew up under a lecture.

931
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,780
I'm used to it.

932
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,350
Actually, I heard

933
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,490
what you said.

934
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,170
You said you want to rent together.

935
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,540
do you want to take him with you?

936
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,300
Yes.

937
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,290
Zhao Jiwei,

938
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,900
Do you want to rent a house with us?

939
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,450
What rent?

940
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,510
Money?

941
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,580
Of course, rent a house costs money.

942
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,090
I won't rent it then.

943
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,980
I have relatives in the city.

944
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,920
I heard that you two made contributions.

945
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,130
How did you

946
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,580
hurt your hand?

947
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,220
What credit?

948
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,180
You don't know.

949
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,190
The warden just called us over

950
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,320
and scolded us.

951
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,840
He even scolded Yang Shu.

952
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,080
I heard from this old cop

953
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,320
that the warden only scolds people he likes.

954
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,780
Really?

955
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,790
Why don't I believe it?

956
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,970
Didn't you see the director just now?

957
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,000
You almost kicked me out.

958
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,450
No.

959
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,780
If the warden really doesn't like you,

960
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,190
he wouldn't have transferred you to the police.

961
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,520
Look at me.

962
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,750
I'm a community police officer.

963
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,100
All I do is to watch surveillance videos.

964
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,170
Today

965
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,870
it's my first time to go to the community.

966
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,410
I finally did something big.

967
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,620
What is it?

968
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,270
Help two young girls and

969
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,000
send a pregnant stray cat

970
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,110
to a pet hospital.

971
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,930
My master paid

972
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,250
200 yuan for checkup.

973
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,980
All the things we do is trivial.

974
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,660
You won't be able to contribute for eight lifetimes.

975
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,940
It's not easy to make achievements.

976
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,880
Master,

977
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,740
what you just did

978
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,130
was not respectful to females and too insulting.

979
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,260
Even if she broke the law,

980
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,660
she is also a lawful citizen

981
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,980
before open trial.

982
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,220
You should show basic respect to her.

983
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,320
Be honest to explain your questions.

984
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,930
If you are really innocent,

985
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,360
the earlier you explain your questions clearly,

986
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,030
the earlier you can go out.

987
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,240
My daughter is just 7 years old.

988
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,860
My husband has never raised a child.

989
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:45,530
Please.

990
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,690
Call my husband.
