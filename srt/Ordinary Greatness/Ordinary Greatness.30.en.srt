6
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,729
Officer.

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,320
Calm down. Take your time.

8
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,250
It's him, officer.

9
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,900
He harassed me. I called the police.

10
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,690
-Okay. -Nonsense.

11
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,460
Don't worry.

12
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,690
What's your name?

13
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,440
Jiang Mengwei.

14
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,440
Jiang Mengwei.

15
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,420
How old are you?

16
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:55,960
28.

17
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,830
28 years old.

18
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,259
How long have you been working here?

19
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,100
More than a year.

20
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,660
More than a year.

21
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,570
You want me to eat this on the street.

22
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,490
Doesn't it help reduce your stress?

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,720
But I can't eat it on the street.

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,370
Take it.

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,200
Find a store and eat it in a corner.

26
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,370
Don't feel down.

27
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,820
It's not a big deal.

28
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,100
I'm here for you.

29
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,220
What can you do?

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,650
I can ask my mom to keep up the work.

31
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,000
Your mom has been busy for so long.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,190
Her efforts can be ruined with one sentence.

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,850
All I can say is

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,070
there's still a long way to go

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,490
to achieve success.

36
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,010
Don't be too pessimistic.

37
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,220
I'm not being pessimistic.

38
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,730
I know my mom too well.

39
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,410
The knot in her heart

40
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,410
won't be easily untied.

41
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,570
As the saying goes,

42
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,740
the key to unlock one's heart lies in their heart.

43
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,260
The knot in your mom's heart.

44
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,700
You know better than I do.

45
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,150
You need to find the right antidote. Take it easy.

46
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,320
You can't hurry.

47
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,540
Yes.

48
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,770
We were being inconsiderate.

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,940
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,170
What's the point?

51
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,380
You already let your master down.

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,910
If you let his only child

53
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,770
go missing

54
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,100
or even die,

55
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,220
how dare you live in this world?

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,600
Mrs. Xia.

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Mrs. Xia. That's too serious.

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,730
It's exaggerating.

59
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,010
I...

60
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,370
I know that

61
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,610
Chief Cheng

62
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,090
is really really

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,040
protective of Xia Jie.

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,340
It's true.

65
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,500
Because of this,

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,220
well,

67
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,690
Xia Jie sometimes argued with Chief Cheng.

68
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,850
Mrs. Xia.

69
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,650
Jie

70
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,410
is really a good model.

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,410
When anything happens at the station,

72
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,980
she'll be on the front line.

73
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,060
On the front line.

74
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,130
What do you mean?

75
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,610
Xia Jie's father already sacrificed himself.

76
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,190
Do you want Xia Jie to do the same?

77
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,730
Mrs. Xia.

78
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,610
About what I just said,

79
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,850
you misunderstood.

80
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,490
Yes.

81
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,240
-Overthinking. -It's a misunderstanding.

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,020
She didn't mean it.

83
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,890
-You're overthinking. -Yes.

84
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,540
What do you mean overthinking?

85
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,730
How did my husband treat

86
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,250
Wang Shouyi?

87
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,900
How did he treat you, Cheng Hao?

88
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,480
Are you worthy of his trust?

89
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,540
Chief Gao.

90
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,880
Gao Chao. What's wrong?

91
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,580
Look.

92
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,930
Gao Chao. What's wrong with you?

93
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,130
I... No, no.

94
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,930
Mrs. Xia. Mrs. Xia. Mrs. Xia.

95
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

96
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,490
Go on.

97
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,370
Go on. Go on.

98
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,070
Please continue.

99
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,420
Why did you bring me

100
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,670
to the conciliation room?

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,780
No...

102
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,360
Mrs. Xia. It's...

103
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,050
Well...

104
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,810
No reasons.

105
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,730
Nothing.

106
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,290
Well.

107
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,530
It just happened that...

108
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,210
It happened that I'm treated as a suspect

109
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,410
or

110
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,340
a family member who may cause trouble.

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,930
You're overthinking, Mrs. Xia.

112
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,720
We won't bring

113
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,900
a suspect here.

114
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,370
You just slapped the table.

115
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,430
And you won't bring them here?

116
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,340
No. I just...

117
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,970
I...

118
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,170
I...

119
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,340
Mrs. Xia.

120
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,540
What's the job of the Balihe Police Station?

121
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,050
It's not my first time being here.

122
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,659
Right.

123
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,460
What's your job here?

124
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,140
We all know it very clearly.

125
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,610
Fine. Tell me.

126
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,100
When will Wang Shouyi come back?

127
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,930
Our chief is really on leave.

128
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,040
We couldn't contact him either.

129
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,660
Fine. Wang Shouyi is not willing to see me.

130
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,370
I'll go to the bureau now.

131
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,420
I'll find the director.

132
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,980
Mrs. Xia. Please sit down.

133
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,440
Take a seat.

134
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,050
Well...

135
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,330
Why are you going to the bureau?

136
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,780
The chief is not here.

137
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,780
We're still here.

138
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,540
Right.

139
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,400
Are you in charge?

140
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,050
Sure.

141
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,900
Yes.

142
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,810
Fine.

143
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,790
I want Xia Jie

144
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,140
to be transferred to the household registration department.

145
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,159
This is HR matter.

146
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,630
What are you doing?

147
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,490
What's the matter?

148
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,100
I don't want to waste time with you.

149
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm going to the bureau to see Song.

150
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,050
I'll see if he dares to let me wait any longer.

151
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,500
Mrs. Xia, why are you doing this?

152
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,800
We didn't say we won't solve it.

153
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,490
We'll solve it. We'll solve it.

154
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,550
I give you three more days.

155
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,540
If you don't reply within three days,

156
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,330
I'll ask the director to come.

157
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,390
He'll hold you all accountable.

158
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,220
Mrs. Xia. Mrs. Xia.

159
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,850
Goodbye.

160
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,850
Instructor.

161
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,480
You promised her.

162
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,060
Why not?

163
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,520
The chief will be back within three days.

164
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,760
You're leaving the problem to the chief.

165
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,050
It's not even a problem.

166
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
It's internal adjustment. Piece of cake.

167
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,740
The point is whether Xia Jie wants to be transferred.

168
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,770
With a mother like that, can she decide for herself?

169
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,540
Gao Chao, don't say that.

170
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,030
But...

171
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,060
All right. Enough.

172
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,810
There are loads of things to handle.

173
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,490
Instructor.

174
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:58,900
Yes?

175
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,900
Secretary Wei of the Balihe subdistrict office

176
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,900
called to speak to you and chief.

177
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,020
He asked why you weren't at the meeting.

178
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,010
He said it was about to commence,

179
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,990
but he didn't see you.

180
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,900
How could I forget about this?

181
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,340
What meeting?

182
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,510
Chief Gao, join the meeting with me.

183
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,700
I...

184
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,980
But instructor.

185
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:14,940
Instructor.

186
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,000
What meeting?

187
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,180
I have things to do this morning.

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,760
It's a municipal campaign.

189
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,310
The city, the district

190
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,370
and the subdistrict

191
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,100
will take the joint operation,

192
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,740
combining with the census,

193
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,290
to carry out a population review.

194
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,370
To remove

195
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,140
illegal property rentals

196
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,980
and unlicensed operations,

197
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,179
the registration of people from outer regions.

198
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,460
And to inspect safety risks.

199
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,010
Adhering to the municipal spirit,

200
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,130
the community is holding a joint meeting.

201
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,340
The chief and I will both attend.

202
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,620
Then you can go with Chief Cheng.

203
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,179
I really need to investigate a case.

204
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,530
Then it'll have to wait.

205
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,720
This... You...

206
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,920
It's about the community.

207
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,840
Didn't you promise

208
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,150
that you would be in charge of this sector?

209
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,850
Yes. Chief Gao.

210
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,710
You should go.

211
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,060
I'll take care of the station.

212
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,800
Okay. I'll arrange it.

213
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,100
No. There isn't enough time.

214
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,690
We'll leave after I get ready.

215
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,370
Chief Cheng, please arrange a car for us.

216
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,000
But...

217
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,580
Okay.

218
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,420
Ms. Xu.

219
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Go first.

220
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,260
You help

221
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,490
arrange a car

222
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,250
for Chief Gao and the instructor.

223
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:03,850
Yes sir.

224
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,650
Come back. I got something.

225
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,060
We have a visitor in the morning.

226
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,980
Help me receive him.

227
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,730
Yes, Chief Gao.

228
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,460
Do you have everything with you?

229
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,100
Yes.

230
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,300
We don't have much time.

231
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,820
Master.

232
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,330
Where are you going?

233
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,250
Inspection.

234
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Nothing important, right?

235
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,300
What?

236
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,700
I mean, if you have time,

237
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,460
come with me.

238
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,200
Where?

239
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,980
You'll know when you get there.

240
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,580
Let's go.

241
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,100
Master, what about me?

242
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,490
Stick to the plan.

243
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,340
Ask Sun Qiancheng and Auxiliary police Wang to go with you.

244
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,480
Urge those people with expired ID cards

245
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,440
to reapply for a new one.

246
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,890
Chief Cheng.

247
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,730
What's the matter, Qizi?

248
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,460
Where's the chief and instructor?

249
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,990
The instructor went to the community for a meeting.

250
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,850
The chief is on leave.

251
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,010
He's on leave?

252
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,060
What's wrong?

253
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,300
Wait, Qizi.

254
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,090
Yes?

255
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,980
Why are you looking for the chief and instructor?

256
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,290
Nothing.

257
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,430
Did anything happen recently?

258
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,850
You don't look very well.

259
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,530
Really?

260
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,580
It's nothing.

261
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,130
Really?

262
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,130
Then,

263
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,980
tell me what it is.

264
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,280
If I can't settle it,

265
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,770
I can help you pass the message.

266
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,990
I want to request a leave of absence too.

267
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,220
Leave?

268
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:58,940
Why?

269
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,650
Can you first change your shift with somebody?

270
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,630
No particular reason.

271
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,440
Then why do you want a day off?

272
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,460
If I don't take some leave,

273
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,820
I think my wife is going to divorce me.

274
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,730
I... I...

275
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,820
Don't... Qizi.

276
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,860
Qizi, don't worry.

277
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,080
I totally understand.

278
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,130
It's quite serious.

279
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,580
Well...

280
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,890
Calm down.

281
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,250
Well.

282
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,420
But.

283
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm not in charge of leave issues.

284
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,850
As soon as the instructor is back,

285
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,490
I'll tell her right away, okay?

286
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,250
But

287
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,290
you'll get a divorce if you aren't on leave.

288
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,890
This is not a reason for a leave of absence.

289
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,850
It's true.

290
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,810
Hello, madam.

291
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,580
What does Ye Wei mean?

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,710
She promised me just now.

293
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,490
And now she's not answering my calls.

294
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,580
She went to the community for a meeting.

295
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,370
She probably can't answer her phone now.

296
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,580
Then tell me,

297
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,730
when can you settle Xia Jie's matter?

298
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,460
Madam, didn't we promise

299
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,650
within three days?

300
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,460
It's only been a while.

301
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,250
You...

302
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,100
You said three days,

303
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,700
so do you have to wait for three days?

304
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,730
It's just a personnel adjustment.

305
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,650
Can't you settle it now?

306
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,850
We already told you

307
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,060
the chief is on leave.

308
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,650
Don't find any excuses.

309
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,820
Before it's approved,

310
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,850
can't you transfer Xia Jie's work first?

311
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,300
How about this?

312
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,980
As soon as the instructor is back,

313
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,690
I'll discuss with her immediately.

314
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,770
There's nothing to discuss.

315
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,300
Hello.

316
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,570
Hello, madam.

317
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:12,610
[Balihe Subdistrict Party and Mass Service Center]

318
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,920
Instructor.

319
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,370
Chief Wang, is everything alright?

320
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,020
All the front-line workers are too tired.

321
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,870
Right.

322
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,340
Secretary Wei, thank you.

323
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Sure, no problem.

324
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,310
What else can we do?

325
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,080
The Party assigned us to this position.

326
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,370
We must do our job.

327
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:12,890
Right.

328
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,180
For the upcoming joint operation,

329
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,700
your police station will play a key role.

330
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,050
Chief Wang is not here.

331
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,010
It's all on you.

332
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,940
We have to rely on everyone.

333
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,160
We'll rely on the station.

334
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,330
We have to work hard together.

335
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,390
Yes.

336
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,610
Sorry, I have to answer this.

337
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,010
Secretary Wei, I totally agree with you.

338
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,730
Don't worry.

339
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,440
The Balihe Police Station

340
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,190
will coordinate with our community

341
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,130
to accomplish the task.

342
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,130
What's the matter, instructor?

343
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,500
It's from my son's school.

344
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,770
They asked me to go to his school.

345
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,890
I wonder how my son got into trouble.

346
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,050
His father is on a business trip.

347
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,870
I'm on my own.

348
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,750
It's getting busier and more chaotic.

349
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,020
You better go.

350
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,340
No way.

351
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,000
We just finished the meeting.

352
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,910
We need to be back at the station to assign work.

353
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,870
You still have me.

354
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,020
My master is there too.

355
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,940
I'll report it to Chief Cheng after I get back.

356
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,980
Then we'll hold a plenary meeting

357
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,940
and assign the work.

358
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,180
Is

359
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,330
it alright?

360
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,340
Just go.

361
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,700
You don't believe in us?

362
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,790
We're here.

363
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,800
Okay. I'll hurry to his school.

364
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,960
I'll be back as soon as it's settled.

365
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,260
You can drive the police car.

366
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,270
No way.

367
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,270
I'll go on my own.

368
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,460
I'll be right back.

369
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,180
-Don't worry. -I'll be right back.

370
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,890
Take your time.

371
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,390
When you left,

372
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,570
was there anything unusual at the shop?

373
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,890
No.

374
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,220
Wait a second.

375
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,000
Instructor.

376
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,360
Chief Gao, I'm sorry

377
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,390
to call you this late.

378
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,670
I just settled my personal matters.

379
00:15:59,130 --> 00:15:59,940
No worries.

380
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,020
What's going on at the station?

381
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,010
Well,

382
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,710
after I came back,

383
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,820
along with Chief Cheng,

384
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,810
we held a meeting.

385
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,580
We conveyed the spirit

386
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,060
of the city, district and subdistrict.

387
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,640
We also made specific arrangements.

388
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,460
Tomorrow at work,

389
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,500
I plan to set up a team

390
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,790
to carry out the work with the community.

391
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,060
Great. Thanks a lot.

392
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,260
By the way, Qizi wanted to request a leave of absence.

393
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,110
But I rejected.

394
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,810
The joint operation is about to commence.

395
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,160
We are short of officers.

396
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,320
I told him not to take a day off.

397
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,520
He's a part of the joint operation.

398
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,530
About this matter,

399
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,340
Chief Cheng also told me.

400
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,060
Let's discuss tomorrow.

401
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,990
Okay.

402
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,130
And also,

403
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,980
Xia Jie's mom

404
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,830
has been constantly making calls.

405
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,040
She called me too.

406
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,890
Chief Gao, if there isn't any urgency,

407
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,980
you should go home and rest soon.

408
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,240
You've been busy all day.

409
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,340
Okay. Don't worry.

410
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,460
I'm almost done.

411
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,770
There are some cases from the day,

412
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,450
which I still need to work on.

413
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,900
Alright. Take care.

414
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,890
Okay. Goodbye.

415
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,700
Where was I?

416
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,440
Anything unusual when you left?

417
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,460
When you left,

418
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,569
was there anything unusual?

419
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,609
No.

420
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,720
When you went outside,

421
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,490
was there anyone suspicious?

422
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,140
Think carefully.

423
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,569
You were the last one to leave.

424
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,050
In the early morning yesterday,

425
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,380
your boss called the police.

426
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,990
The door lock

427
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,600
showed no signs of damage.

428
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,720
Officer,

429
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,200
I really don't know anything.

430
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,570
Although I am not that educated,

431
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,770
I know

432
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
that I will go to jail for stealing.

433
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,770
And

434
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,610
my boss has been nice to me.

435
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,420
How can I steal things?

436
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,250
Don't be nervous.

437
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,050
I didn't say you stole things.

438
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,460
It's only a routine investigation.

439
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,590
Officer,

440
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,870
I really told you everything I knew.

441
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,180
The key to the store.

442
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,050
Other than your boss and you,

443
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,180
who else has it?

444
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,560
It seems she has a partner,

445
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,810
who also has the key.

446
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,730
But the partner never came to the store.

447
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,620
How long has the surveillance camera been broken?

448
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,940
Two to three days.

449
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,980
Ms. Yu bought a new one. It arrived,

450
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,860
but we didn't know how to install it.

451
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,330
We didn't install the camera.

452
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,940
Other than you two,

453
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,880
who else knew the surveillance camera was broken?

454
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,230
I don't know.

455
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,660
I never told anyone.

456
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,490
Chief Gao,

457
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,760
I need to go.

458
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,170
What's wrong?

459
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,530
An old lady came to the police station.

460
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,310
She said she lost her son.

461
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,230
She was crying.

462
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,550
Lost her son?

463
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Then help her find him.

464
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,570
We ran out of officers.

465
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,490
Li Dawei is with Chen.

466
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,140
Lei is with Qizi.

467
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,940
They're all on duty.

468
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,660
An emergency occurred.

469
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,010
Chief Cheng went with two Auxiliary officers.

470
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,380
Who's responsible of the area?

471
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,860
Who's the community police officer?

472
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,930
Zhigang.

473
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,700
Where is he?

474
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,410
He's still at the hospital.

475
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,990
Okay. Got it.

476
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,800
I'll take a look.

477
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,980
How about this?

478
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,730
Send her back first.

479
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,090
Record the basic information from her boss.

480
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,010
I'll be right back.

481
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,810
Got it, Chief Gao.

482
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,460
Let's go.

483
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,010
Where did you go, Liangliang?

484
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,620
Answer the phone.

485
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,090
I'm worried to death.

486
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,980
Officer,

487
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,090
please help me. Help me.

488
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,240
Madam, Take a seat.

489
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,330
I came to help.

490
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:28,900
Help me.

491
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,810
Take a seat.

492
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,420
Tell me. What happened?

493
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,810
It never happened before.

494
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,470
A pest control technician came today.

495
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,090
When I opened the door,

496
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,460
I forgot to close it.

497
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
I'm often forgetful.

498
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,180
When I settled everything,

499
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,530
I realized my son was gone.

500
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,530
Get some water.

501
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,660
Don't cry, madam.

502
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,250
As for your son,

503
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,860
does he have any problem?

504
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,430
You have the problem!

505
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,700
My son is very clever.

506
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,830
We're dependent on each other.

507
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,450
If he is lost,

508
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,980
how can I live?

509
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,780
Don't cry, madam.

510
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,570
It's okay.

511
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,420
Have some water first.

512
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,250
Don't worry.

513
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,010
We'll help you find your son.

514
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,450
Really?

515
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,550
Yes.

516
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,610
Thank you so much.

517
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,620
Did you record the basic information?

518
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,680
Not yet.

519
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,910
I went to find you.

520
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,540
Madam, how old is your son?

521
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,010
14.

522
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,860
14.

523
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,620
Do you remember

524
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,980
your son's ID?

525
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,040
Do you have any of his photos?

526
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,690
I have a photo.

527
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,760
See.

528
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,220
This is the son she's looking for.

529
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,770
Madam, is this your son?

530
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,340
Did you apply for a pet certification?

531
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,730
If you own a dog in the city,

532
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,930
you should apply for documents.

533
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,140
But you have to help me

534
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,250
find him first.

535
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,860
Don't worry, madam.

536
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,660
Your son.

537
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,040
We'll help you find him.

538
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,100
-Thank you. -We need to complete the documents.

539
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,420
Chief Gao, someone called the police.

540
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,760
There's a drunk fight at Tu's Restaurant at San Street.

541
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,900
We got to get there.

542
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,120
Or else someone may die.

543
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:21,810
I know.

544
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,330
Haoran, record madam's information.

545
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,100
Madam, please fill in the form.

546
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,540
Please wait. I'll be back.

547
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,380
And I'll settle this, okay?

548
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,490
Okay. Thank you.

549
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,420
Thank you. Thank you.

550
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:32,980
It's fine.

551
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,180
Thank you. Thank you.

552
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,490
Figure out the clue first.

553
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,090
Who's still at the station?

554
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,900
Sun Jie. He's at the dorm.

555
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

556
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,460
You are the boss, right?

557
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,180
-Hello. -Who called the police?

558
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,620
We didn't.

559
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,270
The police is here. The police is here.

560
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,900
I won!

561
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,900
Give me the money.

562
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,140
You two called the police.

563
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Officer,

564
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,860
you have to do justice.

565
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,180
I said if I called the police,

566
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,570
the police would come.

567
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,660
He didn't believe me.

568
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,010
He wanted to bet.

569
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,250
I believe him now.

570
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,300
What's wrong with you? Lack of manners.

571
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,770
Pour drinks for the officers.

572
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,250
No need.

573
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,940
Do you know what you did?

574
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,900
Making a false report.

575
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,180
Wasting police time.

576
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,220
You violated the Public Security Administration Punishment Law.

577
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,250
According to term 25,

578
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,660
you'll be detained for five

579
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,730
to ten days.

580
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,490
You'll be fined up to 500 yuan.

581
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,570
For less serious circumstances,

582
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,180
you will be detained for up to five days

583
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,130
and fined up to 500 yuan.

584
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,140
Do you understand?

585
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,290
Yes. Yes.

586
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,460
Then let's go.

587
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,610
We'll pay the fine, alright?

588
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,120
You must come with us even if you pay the fine.

589
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
What?

590
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,420
Are you coming with me?

591
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,250
Or we will be forced to take you back.

592
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,900
We'll come with you.

593
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
We'll come with you.

594
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,700
Cuff him.

595
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,380
Yes sir.

596
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,450
Go!

597
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,010
Come on, Sun Jie.

598
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,810
Hello.

599
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,270
Hello, Chief Gao.

600
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,330
We're done here.

601
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,380
Do you need support?

602
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,330
No need.

603
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,220
I'm done too.

604
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,770
Hello.

605
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,720
Chief Gao,

606
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,700
what's going on?

607
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,050
Do you need support?

608
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,480
It's okay. It's solved.

609
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,660
False report.

610
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,050
Okay. Okay.

611
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,660
Can you recall,

612
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,010
when the surveillance camera was broken at your shop,

613
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,900
who else knew about it?

614
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,730
I supposed a lot.

615
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,610
I posted it on WeChat on the day before yesterday.

616
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,490
I posted that the camera was broken.

617
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,960
Who was able to help me change a new one?

618
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,900
In Wechat,

619
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,330
I have at least three thousand friends.

620
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,050
Can I have a look?

621
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,690
On the day before yesterday, you posted it on WeChat.

622
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,460
On that night, your shop was robbed.

623
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,810
We suspect that

624
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,010
somebody knew about

625
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,460
your broken surveillance camera.

626
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,570
They chose that period of time on purpose.

627
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,900
That's terrible.

628
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,010
Many people knew about it.

629
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,010
What can I do?

630
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:26,900
This case

631
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
became tricky.

632
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,380
Because there were

633
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,770
a lot of daily traffic at your shop.

634
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,650
The fingerprint information collected at your shop

635
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,180
was from more than a hundred people.

636
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,730
So we cannot use

637
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,980
fingerprint information to locate the suspect.

638
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,330
Also, the surveillance cameras in and out of

639
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,420
your shop were all broken.

640
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,330
We have no clues

641
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
to investigate this case.

642
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,770
What can I do, officer?

643
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,700
The missing goods were worth 200 to 300 thousands.

644
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,240
It's quite difficult to do small business.

645
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,380
Don't worry.

646
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,380
We are still looking into the case.

647
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,760
The surveillance cameras of nearby streets

648
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,420
may provide some useful information.

649
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,090
Then...

650
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,730
And, listen.

651
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,140
Your partner also has the key to your shop,

652
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,770
right?

653
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,620
Yes, she does.

654
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,620
Can you give us her contacts?

655
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,570
We want to talk to her.

656
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,330
Okay.

657
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,490
Write it down.

658
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,140
Her last name is Zhang.

659
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,010
Why do you need two more days?

660
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,770
I've been extremely busy at the police station.

661
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,770
Your son's school called yesterday.

662
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,290
I don't know what will happen today.

663
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,980
All right. Talk to you later.

664
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,860
I'm still busy.

665
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,570
I don't care. You ought to come back in time.

666
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,570
I have to go.

667
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,790
There's a lot of fuss at home.

668
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,810
A woman

669
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,470
has to take care her parents and children

670
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,220
while working.

671
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,420
It's really challenging.

672
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,420
Instructor.

673
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,140
If you're really busy,

674
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,050
I can help you.

675
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,530
It's okay. Thanks.

676
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,620
Instructor.

677
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,490
Don't listen to my mom.

678
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,920
I really don't want to work at the Household Registration Department.

679
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,140
I chose to be a police officer.

680
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,860
I am willing to face

681
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,770
all the dangers and risks.

682
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,180
Xia Jie,

683
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,140
we need to wait for the chief to settle this.

684
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,130
But your mom

685
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,140
doesn't want you to be on duty now.

686
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,220
Therefore,

687
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,380
Chief Cheng and I decided

688
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,810
to assign you to the joint operation team.

689
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,330
The operation is relatively safe.

690
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,620
Okay?

691
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,010
But instructor,

692
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,900
this is my life,

693
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
not my mom's.

694
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,810
I know.

695
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,460
I totally understand.

696
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,030
But your mom is constantly calling

697
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,610
Chief Cheng and I.

698
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,290
We...

699
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,900
You joining the joint operation

700
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
is not because of other reasons.

701
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,150
We are short of officers in this operation.

702
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,180
Why didn't my master tell me?

703
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,050
Your master promised you

704
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,900
that he wouldn't overprotect you.

705
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:06,980
So...

706
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,030
I got it.

707
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,700
Xia Jie,

708
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,140
protecting her own child

709
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,250
is the natural instinct of a mother.

710
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,420
Especially with your family's case,

711
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,860
you should know,

712
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,530
your mother have nobody

713
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,220
but you.

714
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,490
I can totally understand

715
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,380
her situation.

716
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,490
You should also understand.

717
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,650
I'll go now.

718
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,290
Any problems?

719
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,720
Instructor,

720
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,770
can I request a leave of absence for a few days?

721
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,730
What do you think?

722
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,290
Chief Cheng and Chief Gao

723
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,980
already told me about your case.

724
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,290
We talked about it.

725
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,500
If there's any special circumstances,

726
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,700
or changing shifts,

727
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,900
or taking a half day off,

728
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,980
it won't be a problem.

729
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,770
But your request of a long leave

730
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,320
is unlikely to be approved.

731
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,330
I understand.

732
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,090
I don't have a choice either.

733
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,460
Or else I wouldn't ask.

734
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,940
I know.

735
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:18,860
I can understand.

736
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,010
I can totally understand.

737
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,730
Who doesn't share your experience?

738
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,050
We are really short-handed

739
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,330
at the police station.

740
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,940
Don't mention on leave.

741
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,760
We can't even finish work with full attendance.

742
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,980
But...

743
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,850
No buts.

744
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,460
Let me tell you.

745
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,750
It's not only about you.

746
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
I talked with Chief Cheng and Chief Gao.

747
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,730
When the chief is back,

748
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,820
this will be an important issue

749
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,060
on the chief's agenda.

750
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,560
We'll discuss it thoroughly.

751
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,940
But at the time being,

752
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,680
with the huge workload

753
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,660
tight schedule,

754
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,860
and chief's absence,

755
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,290
everybody is working under huge pressure.

756
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,530
How about this?

757
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,490
You can take part in

758
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,810
the community joint operations.

759
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,170
You can ask for leave after a few days.

760
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,000
Is it okay?

761
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,940
Okay.

762
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,250
Thank you.

763
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,040
Back to work.

764
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,490
What's the matter?

765
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,770
I already told the company.

766
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,900
They approved.

767
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,830
I can come home tomorrow.

768
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,800
I already bought the tickets.

769
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,140
Really! That's great!

770
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,330
Thank you, dear.

771
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,860
Don't mention it.

772
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,180
I just called back home.

773
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,050
Mom told me

774
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,770
that dad went to the hospital on his own.

775
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,960
You better check up on him.

776
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,230
You mean now?

777
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,340
Just now,

778
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,220
a colleague asked for leave

779
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,550
and I didn't approve.

780
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,010
I can't leave.

781
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,700
If I leave, how can I be trusted?

782
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,140
Is your character more important

783
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,690
or our dad's life more important?

784
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,150
Fine.

785
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,500
I didn't mean it that way.

786
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,910
I'm not talking about myself.

787
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,860
A few dozens of officers

788
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
are taking care of tens of thousands of people.

789
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,320
Our operation...

790
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,140
Can you be in my shoes?

791
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,160
I understand.

792
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,560
Didn't I say

793
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,740
I'd be back tomorrow?

794
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,290
But the point is

795
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,900
our dad went to the hospital alone. You...

796
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,010
Officers of the joint operation.

797
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,900
Assemble at the backyard!

798
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,630
Got it.

799
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,920
-Assemble at the backyard! -All right.

800
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,010
Goodbye.

801
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,370
Officers of the joint operation assemble at the backyard!

802
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,320
Hurry! Hurry!

803
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,250
Comrades, listen.

804
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,900
Later,

805
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,490
my master Zhang Zhiyuan leads a team.

806
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,380
Qizi leads a team.

807
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,140
I lead a team.

808
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,810
The instructor leads a team.

809
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,180
We will work with the community.

810
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,290
You must obey orders.

811
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,120
Are you clear?

812
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,250
Yes, sir!

813
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,220
Instructor, let's go.

814
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,940
Let's go.

815
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,090
Let's go.

816
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,570
Instructor, what are you looking for?

817
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,140
You.

818
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,550
Me.

819
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,410
I'm standing in front of you.

820
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,390
Wang just called.

821
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,380
He said his dad went to the hospital on his own.

822
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,290
Then you better go to the hospital.

823
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,250
I'll lead one team.

824
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,010
Is it okay?

825
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,460
It's just inspection and reduction.

826
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,380
We have Ms. Wang.

827
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,260
It shouldn't be a problem.

828
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,380
Just go.

829
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,180
Thank you.

830
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,420
I'll hurry to the hospital.

831
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
I'll be right back if everything's fine.

832
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,250
Hurry! Go!

833
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:09,890
Thank you.

834
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,250
-You guys. -I'm leaving.

835
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,090
Wait for me.

836
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:12,900
Let me get the gear.

837
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,600
Okay.

838
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,050
In the community,

839
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,700
is there a big floating population?

840
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,530
It's alright.

841
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,050
Let's go.

842
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,010
In this village,

843
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,730
is there a big floating population?

844
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,140
Did many owners

845
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,180
rent out their houses?

846
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:33,900
Yes.

847
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,630
And then,

848
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,810
some residents didn't register at the police.

849
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,040
That's illegal residence.

850
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,750
We'll work on

851
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,570
♫Go along the street corner and chase in the alley♫

852

Sir, you're joking.

I'm just saying you should replace your ID.

Nothing else.

Where are your children?

They have their own families.

They don't have time for me.

937

They left you here alone

938

and didn't care about you.

939
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,780
It's ridiculous.

Eat?

945
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,900
I've been starving for 49 days.

No.

But I am so sorry.

956

I'm now at the hospital.

I really can't come today.

958

I can't help you.

963

One of the parents must attend

the parent-teacher conference.

965
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,200
It's your obligation and responsibility.

966

But you two

have missed it for several times.

968

Yesterday's incident

was already a sign.

970

I'm just here to remind you.

No matter how busy you are,

972
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,980
you shouldn't overlook your child's education.

973

I'm not overlooking.

Yeah. Yeah. It's us.

978

I'll apologize to you in person, all right?

982
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,690

It should be. It's an old lady.

She's home.

990

She's home.

Open the door.

992
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,090
We're the police.

993

If you don't open, we'll break open it.

994

What do you want?

995
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,850
How dare you break open my door?

996
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,480
What did I do?

997
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,260
Calm down.

998
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,090
Calm down.

999
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:42,980
I am very calm!

1000
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,520
Cooperate with us.

1001
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,060
If you go on, you're obstructing public officer.

1002
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,570
You're bullying honest people.

1003

You're bullying an old lady.

Why are you so late?

1007
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,420
Where did you go?

1008
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,530
The community.

So late.

1010
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,650
Some people are guerrilla.

1011
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,490
They like to play hide-and-seek.

1012
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,500
They hide in the day.

1013
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,960
They come home to sleep at night.

1014
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,570
Instructor.

1015
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,210
We made some progress.

1016
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,230
Thanks for your effort.

1017
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,600
We've been busy all along.

1018
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,650
Once the chief was not here,

1019
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,450
the workload seemed to double.

1020
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,540
Even if you're the deputy chief,

1021
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,650
you can't randomly give orders.

1022
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,410
What random orders?

1023
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,340
You almost got into a fight

1024
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,520
with a 70-year-old woman.

1025
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,160
I can stop you, can't I?

1026
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,210
Chief Gao,

1027
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,210
there were safety risks at her home.

1028
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,270
Why didn't you let us investigate?

1029
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,490
If you think you're clever,

1030
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,380
then I quit.

1031
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,130
What did you say, Qizi?

1032
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,650
Qizi.

1033
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,250
Come back here.

1034
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:48,900
Qizi.

1035
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,010
Instructor.

1036
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,740
You're back so soon.

1037
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,130
I have to come back.

1038
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,050
What happened?

1039
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,340
Qizi

1040
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,690
can't be triggered

1041
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,260
without any sparks.

1042
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,160
He can lit up on his own.

1043
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,130
What's the matter?

1044
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,090
During the joint operation in the afternoon,

1045
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,380
we met an old woman named Zhang.

1046
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,250
She's notoriously difficult to handle in the village.

1047
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,490
According to a report,

1048
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,860
a suspicious person rented her house.

1049
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,490
Qizi

1050
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,420
went to investigate the safety risk.

1051
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,340
The old lady started to throw tantrum after opening the door.

1052
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,610
I saw them.

1053
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,450
I told

1054
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,090
Qizi to step back first.

1055
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,050
He shouldn't aggravate the conflict.

1056
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,460
He suddenly was angry at me.

1057
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,380
We persuaded him and came back.

1058
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,090
Yes.

1059
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,340
After coming back, he shouted at me.

1060
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,760
What's the matter with Qizi recently?

1061
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,280
Stress.

1062
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,430
But instructor,

1063
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,080
who doesn't have stress?

1064
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,780
We all have stress.

1065
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,860
Chief Gao. Chief Gao.

1066
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,420
Talk less.

1067
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,260
Okay. I'll talk to him.

1068
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,420
It's okay.

1069
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,380
Instructor.

1070
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,580
Qizi.

1071
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,290
Mrs. Xia.

1072
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,420
I was about to call you.

1073
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,860
Listen to me.

1074
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,880
You're right.

1075
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,430
Yes.

1076
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,490
Hello, mom.

1077
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,450
Did you just

1078
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,740
call our instructor?

1079
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,290
Mom, you're forcing me

1080
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,690
to cut ties with you.

1081
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,170
I educated

1082
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,210
his son and daughter.

1083
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,900
If they abandon their father,

1084
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,260
there will be legal consequences.

1085
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,480
You're still up.

1086
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,900
Doing nothing.

1087
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,340
So

1088
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,740
my mom needs to step up.

1089
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,920
It's no use.

1090
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,990
Let's try our best.

1091
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,050
That's right.

1092
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,940
You can't keep frowning.

1093
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:15,940
How dare you come?

1094
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,210
My husband died because of you.

1095
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,860
Why are you here?

1096
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,490
Coming.

1097
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,570
Madam.

1098
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,420
Why did you come?

1099
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,980
Are you here to talk about Jie's transfer

1100
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,170
or to change my mind?

1101
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,050
Neither.

1102
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,980
I'm here to talk about

1103
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,570
what happened between my master and I.
