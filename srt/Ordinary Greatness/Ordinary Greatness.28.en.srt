Chen.

7
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,020
You're back, Chen.

8
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,660
Call me if anything happens.

9
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,140
Okay.

10
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,490
Bro, you're back.

11
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:52,920
Chief Gao.

12
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,610
By the way,

13
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,850
your sister-in-law

14
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,229
bought me some good tea.

15
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,170
Don't always drink your kind of tea.

16
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,490
It's okay.

17
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,440
I'll send it to you later.

18
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,259
Xia Jie.

19
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,910
Xia Jie.

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,540
Officer Chen.

21
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,610
Liu Xiaoli caused trouble again.

22
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,650
We brought her back.

23
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,740
She said she wanted to see you.

24
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:19,540
What happened?

25
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,290
She accompanied guests in drinking at the bar

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,800
and got into a fight with another lady.

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,820
That lady called the police,

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,420
so we brought the two back.

29
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,700
All right, let's go and have a look.

30
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,100
It's you again.

31
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,100
Tell me, what's going on?

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,620
Mr. Chen.

33
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,460
Don't call me Mr. Chen.

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,660
Tell me, why did you make trouble?

35
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,700
Xia Jie.

36
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,260
Come.

37
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,500
Master,

38
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,460
you don't have to see her.

39
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,450
Look at her hair. It's dyed green.

40
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,420
Just like a ghost.

41
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,020
Enough.

42
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,940
Xia Jie.

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,690
What?

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,970
I'm going to

45
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,140
ask the instructor to come over.

46
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,420
Please ask her for me later.

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,380
According to the police responding record,

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,540
the bar she went

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,620
is very far from her home.

50
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,460
Ask her why she went to this one

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,340
and why she caused trouble.

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,540
The more carefully she says, the better.

53
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,140
See if there's anything new.

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,180
Master, I think

55
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,740
she can't live without such place

56
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,620
and such job.

57
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,980
The thing she said last time is probably fake.

58
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,780
She's hopeless.

59
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,940
OK.

60
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,900
That's it, Xia Jie.

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,780
Xia Jie.

62
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,690
What's up?

63
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,300
What is it?

64
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,019
You seem preoccupied.

65
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,220
Why are you looking at me

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,140
instead of working hard?

67
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,420
Hello, Instructor.

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,700
Instructor.

69
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,180
Chen.

70
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,140
Instructor.

71
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,460
Did you talk to her?

72
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,100
Yes.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,409
You're right.

74
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,860
She came here for a reason.

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,650
In a sense,

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,430
she

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,420
came here specially for you.

78
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,140
What do you mean?

79
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,380
She told me

80
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,560
in this world,

81
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,850
you're the only one

82
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,220
who listened to her carefully

83
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,420
and trusted her.

84
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,460
So she came here.

85
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,980
It can be said that

86
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,100
she caused trouble and fought at the bar

87
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,220
to attract the police's attention.

88
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,780
In this way,

89
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,700
she can come here

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,780
again

91
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,490
to get your attention.

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,500
So she told me that

93
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,910
she thought

94
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,660
you're the only one who could help her.

95
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,260
This child...

96
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,650
It's a general dispute

97
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,340
for two girls fighting and pulling their hair.

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,700
We can just educate them and release them.

99
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,940
She said she wanted to see you before she left.

100
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,220
Let's go.

101
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,460
Dawei, stop following me.

102
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,500
Keep looking.

103
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,540
See if there are any new clues.

104
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,220
Okay.

105
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,490
-Wait for the call.
-OK.

106
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,010
Alright.

107
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,630
Stop crying.

108
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,690
Tell me what happened.

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
Then I can help you.

110
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,660
Mr. Chen.

111
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,460
Since that thing happened last time,

112
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,300
I couldn't stay at home anymore.

113
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,700
No one believed me.

114
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,530
They said I was lying

115
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,670
and I found someone to rape me.

116
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,350
My stepmother doesn't allow me to go home now,

117
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,220
and my dad doesn't care about me.

118
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,210
I really have nowhere to live.

119
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,090
I can only dawdle outside.

120
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,980
Mr. Chen,

121
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,060
why is life so hard?

122
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,420
Only your life isn't easy?

123
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,340
Everyone else lives easier than you, right?

124
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,420
When something happens to you,

125
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,020
you only blame others, your family and your stepmother.

126
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,340
Your life is yours.

127
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,340
Why do you always blame others?

128
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,940
Liu Xiaoli,

129
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,980
you're not a kid anymore, you know?

130
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,450
You're an adult.

131
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,340
Does it matter that much how others treat you?

132
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,250
Look at you.

133
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,860
Look at you now.

134
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,940
You look like a ghost.

135
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,980
You give up on yourself.

136
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,540
Who can you blame if your future is ruined?

137
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,210
You can only blame yourself.

138
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,220
But...

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,580
But my stepmother won't let me in.

140
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,640
She doesn't let you in?

141
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,050
Is it up to her or the law?

142
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,420
Your household register is there, you know?

143
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,780
She can't stop you from going home.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,930
Master, the number you asked for is here.

145
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,570
Liu Xiaoli.

146
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,380
Alright, you can go back now.

147
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,820
I'll go there myself.

148
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,420
Don't worry.

149
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,110
I'll help you till the end.

150
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,450
Remember what I told you last time.

151
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,260
You must learn to love yourself, you know?

152
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,299
Alright, Xia Jie, Dawei,

153
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,580
send her out.

154
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Be careful.

155
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,090
Your master seemed so angry just now.

156
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,020
What happened to him?

157
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,220
He said Liu Xiaoli was a disappointment.

158
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,730
My master

159
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,330
must think of Liu Xiaoli as Jiajia.

160
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,620
Every family has a sad story.

161
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,060
Xia Jie, what's wrong?

162
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,900
Don't bottle it up inside.

163
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,020
I'm not.

164
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,850
Do you think I can't tell it?

165
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,580
You sighed

166
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,620
and was distracted.

167
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,780
And you just thought about life.

168
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,500
Is it because of your mom again?

169
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,860
I accidentally saw your phone.

170
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,220
You want a loan?

171
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,300
You once wanted to

172
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,260
do ride-hailing business

173
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,380
and then wanted to refund the rent.

174
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,150
I know you have financial difficulties.

175
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,340
But your mom

176
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,300
has been back from Dali, right?

177
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,900
Then why you...

178
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,740
Li Dawei,

179
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,820
why are you so nosy?

180
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,450
Don't provoke me.

181
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,100
The more you provoke me,

182
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,420
I'm telling you, the more I will care.

183
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,580
Tell me.

184
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,780
Since you have spent money,

185
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,700
and your mom has gone to Dali,

186
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,500
she can make you so unhappy

187
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,980
after she came back?

188
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,740
Why should I tell you?

189
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,090
It's said that

190
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,260
find the police if you have any problem. I...

191
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,220
I'm also a cop.

192
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,420
I can find myself.

193
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,340
No, more people...

194
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,040
More people, more power, you know?

195
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,290
You can't deal with

196
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,340
the problem alone.

197
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,900
Tell me and you can have another person to share the burden.

198
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,380
Mind your own business.

199
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
What do you mean?

200
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,380
Fine, I just can't stay idle.

201
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,240
Tell me.

202
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,430
Maybe I can help you.

203
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,340
Xia Jie.

204
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,220
Dawei.

205
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,380
Come with me.

206
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,220
Something has happened.

207
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,980
Get changed quickly.

208
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
I'll wait for you in the car.

209
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,180
OK.

210
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,260
Liu Xiaoli didn't lie.

211
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
That night,

212
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,220
she must have been raped.

213
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,870
Although we don't have enough evidence,

214
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm sure

215
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,940
what she said is true.

216
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,990
But we have no evidence now.

217
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,780
What should we do?

218
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,700
Solving the case is of secondary importance now.

219
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,780
Let's find a place

220
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,140
to let her stay.

221
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,620
We can't let her get hurt anymore.

222
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,420
But she's not in our jurisdiction.

223
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,260
But she is our client.

224
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,420
We have to help her.

225
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,660
Your home?

226
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,220
-You actually know this is your home?
-Let me in.

227
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,020
No way!

228
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,570
Look at you.

229
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
You're a disgrace to your dad.

230
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,660
Where are your wild men?

231
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,700
They dumped you?

232
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,740
Go find them.

233
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,620
You're the one who's having affairs.

234
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,820
I date with the wild men?

235
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,140
You're the one who do that.

236
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,460
-What are you talking about?
-You think...

237
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,100
What are you talking about?

238
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,700
I don't know what you did behind my dad's back?

239
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,620
Who do you think you are in this family?

240
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,900
This house,

241
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,180
the hostel and the hair salon

242
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,480
were earned by my mom when she was alive

243
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,060
together with my dad.

244
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,500
I can share them but you cannot.

245
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,540
Right?

246
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,320
Fine.

247
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,020
Ask your dad to kick me out.

248
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,250
Listen.

249
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,680
I'll make it clear today.

250
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,860
There's only one of us can stay in this house.

251
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,930
Look who your dad will choose.

252
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,500
Fine.

253
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,370
What are you looking at? Go away.

254
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,500
Try it.

255
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,260
Let me in! Let me in!

256
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,970
What happened?

257
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,020
-Liu Xiaoli.
-Mr. Chen, it's her.

258
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,980
She didn't let me in

259
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,460
and threw my things out.

260
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,060
Hello. Hello.

261
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
Are you Liu Xiaoli's stepmother?

262
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,300
I don't deserve it.

263
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,220
Who are you?

264
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,010
We're police officers from Balihe Police Station.

265
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,540
Hello, madam.

266
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,990
Although you're Liu Xiaoli's stepmother,

267
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,520
you're a family after all.

268
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,140
And her family register is here.

269
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,660
You can't stop her

270
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,740
from living here.

271
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,460
This is our family business.

272
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,940
It's none of your business.

273
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,740
Balihe, right?

274
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,730
Balihe Police Station

275
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,860
has nothing to do with us.

276
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,500
Yes, yes.

277
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,780
But you can't say that.

278
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,530
Liu Xiaoli.

279
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,610
Is your father here?

280
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,300
He drinks outside every day.

281
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,900
Who knows when he will come back?

282
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,860
Don't mention that man.

283
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,340
He drinks every day.

284
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,260
My money is not enough for him to drink.

285
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,380
He even brought such a kid with him

286
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,190
who only

287
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,730
seduces wild men outside all day long.

288
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,020
I really don't know that

289
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,010
you're quite capable.

290
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,060
You've seduced two police officers.

291
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,980
How could you...

292
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
How could you say that?

293
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,580
I'm warning you.

294
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,180
If you insult the police,

295
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,660
you shall bear legal liability.

296
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,020
Mom.

297
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,010
Sister, you're back?

298
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,120
Your class is over?

299
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,300
Go do your homework.

300
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,310
Go in.

301
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,380
This woman...

302
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,060
Liu Xiaoli, how about this?

303
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,780
You go to the community office first

304
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,630
and wait for us.

305
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,660
Dawei.

306
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,300
I'll take that for you.

307
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,940
Thank you.

308
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,460
Let's go.

309
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,900
Chen.

310
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,900
Chief Song.

311
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,260
What brings you here?

312
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,540
Come, have a seat.

313
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,220
OK. OK.

314
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,220
Come on.

315
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,860
OK. Come on.

316
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
Have a seat.

317
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,850
Where is Chief Wang?

318
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,140
He is in the police station...

319
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,980
He lost the tug-of-war of our two police stations

320
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,100
several days ago.

321
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,980
He also said that our stations

322
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,890
can find a time to have another contest.

323
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,540
What happened?

324
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,740
He doesn't talk about it now.

325
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,890
Is he afraid of losing?

326
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
Don't you know Chief Wang?

327
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,060
He's old enough to brag anything.

328
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,380
But Chief Song,

329
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,100
I'm here today to trouble you

330
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,110
for another thing.

331
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,780
What is it?

332
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,180
There's a girl named Liu Xiaoli in our jurisdiction.

333
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,140
You know her, right?

334
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,170
Yes, yes.

335
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,900
She

336
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,420
is one of our biggest problems.

337
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,180
She

338
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,500
keeps making small troubles.

339
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,220
Yes.

340
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,890
What?

341
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,900
Did she commit a crime in your jurisdiction?

342
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,060
If you take her over,

343
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,130
it'll save me a lot of trouble.

344
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,860
No.

345
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,340
I met her

346
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,380
because of a case.

347
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,100
But as far as I know,

348
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,780
I think this kid

349
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,940
is not bad, right?

350
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,020
It's mainly because her mother passed away early

351
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,620
and she has an irresponsible father,

352
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,580
who doesn't care about anything.

353
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,180
Many kids turn bad

354
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,380
little by little because of that.

355
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,460
Chen,

356
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,340
you've cared about many things.

357
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,250
But how can you deal with the father-daughter relationship?

358
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,300
Not even good officials can settle family troubles.

359
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,900
Besides,

360
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,180
we...

361
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,530
we all understand this truth.

362
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,140
But we police

363
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,110
can't take such a big responsibility.

364
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,100
That's right.

365
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,540
Even so,

366
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,360
we've run into this.

367
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,100
How can you ignore it?

368
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,980
We are the police, after all.

369
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,980
Right, Chief Song?

370
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,820
Moreover, she is very likely

371
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,540
a witness of a major case.

372
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,170
So we have to protect her, right?

373
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,420
Can you find a place for her to stay

374
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,820
in your jurisdiction

375
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,620
and then find her a job?

376
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,720
Finding a job is easy.

377
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,350
There are not top jobs but there are ordinary ones.

378
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,700
But for the place to stay...

379
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,620
You're challenging me.

380
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,620
Yes.

381
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,330
But I've been to her house.

382
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,970
Legally speaking,

383
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,080
her stepmother has no right to stop her

384
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,070
from staying at home.

385
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,310
But you know her family situation, right?

386
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,490
Even if we police

387
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,310
send her back,

388
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,500
it's hard to guarantee that

389
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,450
her stepmother won't kick her out again, right?

390
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,460
Besides, even if she stays here,

391
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,380
she'll feel like she has to depend on others.

392
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,460
You have to help her.

393
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,420
How about this?

394
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,660
I

395
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,400
get her a qualification of low-rent housing

396
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,180
and arrange a job for her.

397
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,180
Her salary can support her.

398
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,780
How about this?

399
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,380
That's great, Chief Song.

400
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,340
Well, I owe you a favor.

401
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,060
What?

402
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,320
You're working in our jurisdiction.

403
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,700
I owe you a favor.

404
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,770
This young man is your new apprentice?

405
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,820
Hello, Chief.

406
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,780
You look energetic.

407
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,060
Better than you.

408
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,880
He's a silly boy.

409
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,500
Okay, we're leaving.

410
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,360
OK. OK.

411
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,700
Take care. Thank you, Chief Song.

412
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,870
OK. OK. Please stay.

413
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,780
Okay, let's go.

414
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,220
Thank you, manager.

415
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,850
Thank you.

416
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,910
Please stay.

417
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,900
Thank you. Thank you.

418
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,960
How is it?

419
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,940
Yes. You look energetic.

420
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,609
Good.

421
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,280
Okay, let's go.

422
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,940
Let's go.

423
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,260
Xiaoli.

424
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,260
Although you'll be a cashier in the supermarket,

425
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,730
it's hard to find a job like this.

426
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,060
You can do this for Chief Song's sake,

427
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,339
so you must cherish it.

428
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,010
Also,

429
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,960
the cashier

430
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,230
has to deal with money.

431
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,970
You must be careful.

432
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,050
Be scrupulous about it.

433
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,140
By the way,

434
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,380
how is the house

435
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,940
rented for you?

436
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,620
Have you checked it out?

437
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,860
Yes, it's good.

438
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,460
It's just behind the police station.

439
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,700
It will be safe this time.

440
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,500
Safety is good.

441
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,020
Safety is more important than anything.

442
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,940
Xiaoli,

443
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,060
you must work hard from now on

444
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,020
and live a good life.

445
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,140
You're still young, right?

446
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,040
As long as you work hard,

447
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,830
the happy days lie ahead of you, right?

448
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,710
Chief Song has told your situation

449
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,620
to your manager.

450
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,290
In the future,

451
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,750
if you have any ideas or requirements,

452
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,290
just tell him.

453
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,500
Don't be afraid, right?

454
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,660
Also,

455
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,180
we're still investigating your case.

456
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,820
But I promise you

457
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,500
as long as that case once happened,

458
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,740
the criminal will definitely be brought to justice.

459
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,340
Even if he runs to the end of the world,

460
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,980
we will get him back.

461
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,500
Mr. Chen,

462
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,640
do you still suspect the truth of that case?

463
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,900
I believe you.

464
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,650
But I am a police officer.

465
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,490
I have to find evidence to support all crimes.

466
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,940
But we will find the evidence.

467
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,310
Alright, I'll stop nagging here.

468
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,610
Work hard.

469
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm leaving.

470
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,260
Okay.

471
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,160
By the way,

472
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,380
I'm afraid you won't have time to drink water when you're busy.

473
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,100
Drink more water, okay?

474
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,820
I bought you a small kettle.

475
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,860
It's convenient to drink.

476
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,790
Drink more water and work hard.

477
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,900
Okay.

478
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,820
Okay, I'm leaving.

479
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,090
Mr. Chen.

480
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,540
Mr. Chen,

481
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,620
thank you.

482
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,620
Okay, thank you.

483
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,020
Come, Jiajia.

484
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,570
Here. Okay.

485
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,820
Here's ice cream.

486
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,050
And chicken wings.

487
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,140
Eat more.

488
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,700
It's all yours.

489
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,570
Dad, her stepmother doesn't want her?

490
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,980
Yes.

491
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,620
Outsiders

492
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,290
know her just wandering around

493
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,900
and ruining herself.

494
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,640
But they don't know

495
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,090
the misfortune behind her.

496
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,090
At first,

497
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,660
I didn't like this child either.

498
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,250
I think

499
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,500
she's an adult now, right?

500
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,100
She should be responsible for herself.

501
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,020
Why can't she live a good life

502
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,420
like a decent kid, right?

503
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,050
She always dyes her hair

504
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,760
yellow or green,

505
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,460
makes her face look like a ghost,

506
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,220
and goes to nightclubs, bars

507
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,250
and other places.

508
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,880
That's what I used to think of her.

509
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,280
But when I found out

510
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,230
her family background and experience,

511
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,700
I understood her.

512
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,100
Besides,

513
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,810
I really take pity on her.

514
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
Actually, she is also a girl who lacks love.

515
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,700
Jiajia.

516
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,060
You are different from her.

517
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,700
You have me.

518
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,260
Yes.

519
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,900
In fact, for you, I...

520
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,490
I just don't know how to express it.

521
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,220
Do you know that?

522
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,150
All these years, without you by my side,

523
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,900
I felt upset.

524
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,500
I couldn't pull myself together no matter what I did.

525
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,780
After you came back,

526
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,300
I felt much better.

527
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,740
I'm full of energy when facing everything.

528
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm too stupid.

529
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,820
I don't know

530
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,620
how to express my feelings to you.

531
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,980
Dad, I know.

532
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,130
I know you love me.

533
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,450
Me too.

534
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,220
I also don't know how to say.

535
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,240
Jiajia,

536
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,980
tell me if you need anything.

537
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,980
I will try my best to do.

538
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Dad, actually I know everything.

539
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,270
I just feel that your life is too hard.

540
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,380
I want to care about you.

541
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,100
But I don't know why

542
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,220
the more I care about you,

543
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,500
the more I want to get mad at you.

544
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,220
Dad, I'm sorry.

545
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,050
Please forgive me.

546
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,340
Silly girl.

547
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,580
You don't need to say

548
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,020
sorry or forgiveness to me.

549
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,340
You and I...

550
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,970
You actually take after me.

551
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,010
You also keep everything to yourself.

552
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,700
You don't want to and won't say anything.

553
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,100
By the way,

554
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,700
Jiajia,

555
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,500
I have something

556
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,420
to discuss with you.

557
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,570
Do you plan

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,810
to continue staying with

559
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,990
Xia Jie?

560
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,620
I mean

561
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,420
Xia Jie

562
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,020
goes to work and deals with cases every day.

563
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,420
She's so busy and tired.

564
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,930
Is it a liitle inconvenient?

565
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,180
If you don't want to live with me,

566
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,940
it's okay.

567
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,690
Then I will rent a house

568
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,780
next to our home for you.

569
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,260
What do you think?

570
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,920
Dad.

571
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,490
I'll go home with you.

572
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,700
That's great.

573
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,620
Here.

574
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,060
I'll drink this.

575
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,140
Chen, you're here.

576
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,740
Morning.

577
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,380
Morning.

578
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,780
-Chen.
-Good morning.

579
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,410
Morning, Officer Chen.

580
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,240
Morning, Xia Jie.

581
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,350
Morning, Chen.

582
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,480
-Are you busy?
-Morning, Chen.

583
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,970
Zhigang.

584
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,020
Master.

585
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,120
Dawei, good morning.

586
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,340
I've been thinking

587
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,550
if Yue Wei

588
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,630
is really a habitual offender

589
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,730
as you think,

590
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,380
then Liu Xiaoli is absolutely not

591
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,220
the first victim.

592
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,100
Did we have

593
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,090
unsolved rape cases before?

594
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,020
Is there any DNA

595
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,300
left in these cases?

596
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,380
If the DNA

597
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,530
can match Yue Wei's,

598
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,210
we can prove that he did those cases.

599
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,530
So,

600
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,220
I was searching on the Internet just now.

601
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,140
Did you find anything?

602
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,180
Hey, there's really something.

603
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,060
Look.

604
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,330
In 2014, a girl

605
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,980
reported to the police station in Xianqian Street,

606
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,440
saying she was taken to Yue Wei's house

607
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,420
and was raped by him.

608
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,780
But just like this time,

609
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,580
the police at that time couldn't figure out

610
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,500
whether it was rape or voluntary,

611
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,900
so they closed the case.

612
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,290
That's why we didn't find out before.

613
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,500
I found it in the record of the case closing.

614
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,490
You're good.

615
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,620
You've improved.

616
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,580
Not only that.

617
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,420
Let me show you.

618
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,740
I have a picture of this girl.

619
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,850
Look, who does she look like?

620
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,220
Liu Xiaoli.

621
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,640
Do you have her contact information?

622
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,290
Yes.

623
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,460
Here. I've written it down.

624
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,960
ID number and address.

625
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,620
Okay, take it. Let's go.

626
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,900
Hello.

627
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,060
Is Lin Cuicui here?

628
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,700
Looking for our manager? Please wait a moment.

629
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,260
Manager Lin, someone's here for you.

630
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,320
Thank you.

631
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,090
Hello, this way please.

632
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,810
Hello.

633
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,380
We're from Balihe Police Station.

634
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,540
This is Officer Chen.

635
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,420
Hello, I'm Li Dawei.

636
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,660
We've talked on the phone before.

637
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,050
I told you on the phone

638
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,310
not to come to me.

639
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,300
I know nothing.

640
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,980
Besides, you come to my unit.

641
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,300
It will affect my work.

642
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,170
We're doing this for work.

643
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,290
Sorry, Manager Lin.

644
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,260
We'll leave right away.

645
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,500
If you have anything to report

646
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,980
or remember anything,

647
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,820
you can call this number.

648
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,900
Sorry for bothering you.

649
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,780
Bye.

650
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,880
Master, we just let go of this clue?

651
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,780
Lin Cuicui.

652
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,220
Hello?

653
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,980
Lin Cuicui,

654
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,820
we've found your report record that year.

655
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,050
Yes.

656
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,800
You've been trying to forget that hurt.

657
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,180
We understand.

658
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,620
However,

659
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,380
if the criminal can't be punished,

660
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,620
your injury will never heal up.

661
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,460
What we need to do now

662
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,620
is to prevent him from being at large forever.

663
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,660
According to our speculation,

664
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,780
he has been committing crimes all these years.

665
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,620
We want to bring him to justice,

666
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,220
so we need your help.

667
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,260
He knows me.

668
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,860
Once

669
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,760
we met on the way.

670
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,260
He even made a gesture to wipe my neck.

671
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,090
So,

672
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,100
only by catching him as soon as possible

673
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,010
can you be truly safe.

674
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,330
Fine, I'll tell you.

675
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,020
Back then,

676
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,930
I was 18 years old.

677
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,010
I just came to the city

678
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,450
and worked as a foot therapist at a foot massage shop.

679
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,020
But...

680
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,500
But if I tell you now,

681
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,300
don't punish me.

682
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,300
Don't worry.

683
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,740
It's all in the past.

684
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,610
I really needed money back then.

685
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,460
My boss also wanted us to do that,

686
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,740
so that he could get commission.

687
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,960
If the customer gave us a lot of money,

688
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,290
we could go out too.

689
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,500
So Yue Wei showed up at this time?

690
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,220
But he didn't follow the normal procedure.

691
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,970
He just waited for me at the gate

692
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,010
after he washed his feet in our shop.

693
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,260
He asked me to go with him

694
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,020
and gave me 500 yuan.

695
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,940
He said there's no need to tell the boss.

696
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,700
500 yuan

697
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,580
was not a small amount to me.

698
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,260
In a moment of madness,

699
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,490
I left with him.

700
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,220
And then?

701
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,460
Then,

702
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,570
after I went to his house,

703
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,620
I found something was wrong.

704
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,060
I wanted to leave,

705
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,590
but he...

706
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,020
he tied me to the bed

707
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,820
and tortured me for two or three hours.

708
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,020
He didn't let me go after that.

709
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,260
He was drinking alone

710
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,260
as he told me that

711
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,860
I shouldn't trust men easily,

712
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,100
and I shouldn't leave.

713
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,010
Here, have some water.

714
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,770
Take your time.

715
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,970
I was terrified.

716
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,020
I saw him holding

717
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,060
a cleaver.

718
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,580
I thought the next second,

719
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,300
he would stab me with that cleaver.

720
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,260
I felt like I'm going to die.

721
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,380
How did you escape then?

722
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,250
Maybe I was really lucky.

723
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,380
When I thought I was dying,

724
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,500
he answered a phone call.

725
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,900
Soon after,

726
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,380
he started crying.

727
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,340
After that, he untied me.

728
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,380
He even yelled at me

729
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,620
and asked me to get out before he changed his mind.

730
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,300
Did he give you money?

731
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,260
In that situation,

732
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,640
how could I ask him for money?

733
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,820
It's lucky enough that I could survive.

734
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,860
After I left his house,

735
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,060
I was so scared.

736
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,490
I don't know

737
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,860
whether I was lucky to survive,

738
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,370
or I just met

739
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,340
a perverted customer.

740
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,260
After I came home, the more I thought about it, the more scared I was.

741
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,810
So I went to the police station in Xianqian Street.

742
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,730
But Yue Wei insisted that

743
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,780
it's consensual, right?

744
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,260
Not only that,

745
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,010
he threatened

746
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,260
to report our shop for prostitution.

747
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,660
I was afraid,

748
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,240
so I couldn't insist on any longer.

749
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,260
Is this photo what you looked like back then?

750
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,580
Yes.

751
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,860
August 21, 2014.

752
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,280
This should have happened before.

753
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,310
But it won't be too far.

754
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,060
Maybe one or two days,

755
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,560
at most three or four days.

756
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,940
Okay.

757
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,180
If you have any news,

758
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
inform us immediately.

759
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,610
Okay, thank you.

760
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,580
Master.

761
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,820
Yue Wei has left home for many years.

762
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,860
The local police

763
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,940
can't recognize him anymore.

764
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,980
They need to check

765
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,780
to see if something happened

766
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,960
in Yue Wei's house those days.

767
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:51,980
Dawei,

768
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,890
I really have a feeling that

769
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,140
Lin Cuicui and Liu Xiaoli

770
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,260
may be the luckiest two.

771
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,860
Other girls

772
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,200
might never come out alive

773
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,880
after they went into his rental house.

774
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,820
You should quickly check

775
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,460
if there are any missing persons in the past two years.

776
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,780
The check point is the girls in the nightclubs,

777
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,820
foot massage shops

778
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,699
and

779
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,489
bars.

780
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,820
Do you suspect

781
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,820
he's a serial killer who killed fallen women?

782
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,420
It's hard to conclude that now.

783
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,900
But look,

784
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,860
there are many similar points in the two cases.

785
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,920
And there are many points

786
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,620
being very suspicious.

787
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,179
Then give these materials to Captain Luo.

788
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,020
We gave them the clues last time,

789
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,020
but they dealt with it as prostitution and whoring.

790
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,420
Then give these new clues to Captain Luo.

791
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,179
Our police station is to maintain security.

792
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,860
Solving big cases

793
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,179
is the business of the criminal police group.

794
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,300
We can't replace their role.

795
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,580
Okay, Chief.

796
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,340
We'll do it.

797
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,020
Okay.

798
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,060
There was once before.

799
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,790
Then why didn't we find out at that time?

800
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,080
Captain Luo, here's the thing.

801
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,090
Just like this time,

802
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,340
they couldn't tell

803
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,620
whether it's rape or prostitution and whoring.

804
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,530
So the case was closed.

805
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,020
You mean

806
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,310
investigating whether there are any missing women?

807
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,020
Yes.

808
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,380
The point is

809
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,420
women who used to work in the brothel

810
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,140
at least ten years ago.

811
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,130
Okay, we'll investigate it right away.

812
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,410
If there is any new progress,

813
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,390
we'll inform you in time.

814
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,140
Please.

815
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,880
Captain Luo,

816
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,760
do you believe in intuition?

817
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,140
I do.

818
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,790
But

819
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,300
I believe the evidence more.

820
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,660
Master, they are definitely not as dedicated as us.

821
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,020
Why should we hand it over to them?

822
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,620
This is internal work of the police.

823
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,550
But

824
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,990
Captain Luo is an experienced criminal policeman.

825
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,900
I'm not worried about that.

826
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,140
I'm just worried

827
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,300
he has too many cases now.

828
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,900
He might not have much energy

829
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,780
to our case.

830
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,540
That's why we should deal with it.

831
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,160
Just give it to them.

832
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,670
We just need to keep an eye on it.

833
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,650
Hello, Chief.

834
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,540
There's a fighting.

835
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:22,980
It's a fighting with weapons.

836
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,230
Okay, we'll reinforce them right away.

837
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,460
Jinbao Street, right?

838
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,950
Come on.

839
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,430
Dawei, give me little rice.

840
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,060
OK.

841
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,580
Zhijie, is anyone here?

842
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,300
Sit down.

843
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,280
The rice is too hard recently.

844
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,820
Jinbao Street.

845
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,460
It's one we went to

846
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,980
deal with the fighting with weapons...

847
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,100
Stop that.

848
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,660
Hello.

849
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,060
What did you find?

850
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,260
What did you say?

851
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,730
Are you sure?

852
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,140
Thank you.

853
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,300
This news is very important to us.

854
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,180
Thank you so much.

855
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,390
Okay. Okay.

856
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,980
There are clues from Linchang Police Station.

857
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,820
Master.

858
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,260
On the night of August 20, 2014,

859
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,440
Yue Wei's mother died.

860
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,820
To be specific,

861
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,930
she died at night

862
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,910
at around 12 o'clock.

863
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,010
In other words,

864
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,470
not long after his mother passed away,

865
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,020
his family called Yue Wei

866
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,600
to inform him about his mother's death.

867
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,310
Master, it's very likely that

868
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,140
Yue Wei was trying to kill Lin Cuicui.

869
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,440
After he answered this call

870
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,870
and knew about his mother's death,

871
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,640
his plan was ruined by this accident.

872
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,360
That's why Lin Cuicui

873
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,770
survived.

874
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,580
Master, you're right.

875
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,940
Yue Wei is a perverted killer.

876
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,490
We're not sure.

877
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,500
It's just

878
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,460
our reasoning.

879
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,030
Strictly speaking,

880
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,140
that's not reasoning.

881
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,540
It's just a possibility.

882
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,530
How about this?

883
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,870
Let's report to the chief first.

884
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,070
In a city like ours,

885
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,140
it's not realistic that there are no missing persons.

886
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,800
But most of them only

887
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,160
lost contact with their families temporarily.

888
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,130
Most likely, they could be contacted soon.

889
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
But for this girl,

890
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,220
since she went missing,

891
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,500
there's no news about her till now.

892
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,850
How long has she been missing?

893
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,870
What did she do before she went missing?

894
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,650
The case was reported nine years ago.

895
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,610
Before she went missing,

896
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,140
she was to accompany guests in drinking in a nightclub.

897
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,680
She disappeared without any signs.

898
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:01,850
As you all know,

899
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,980
people in this kind of place get moved around a lot.

900
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,240
If it weren't this girl

901
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,970
still had three months of salary to be paid,

902
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,910
and

903
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,550
her friend paid attention to her,

904
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,780
the nightclub wouldn't have reported this case.

905
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,580
She is

906
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,740
in the jurisdiction of

907
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,460
the criminal police group in the city.

908
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,180
When the group received this report,

909
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,930
after some investigation,

910
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,310
they found even the girl's ID card was fake.

911
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,660
They didn't find any more suspicious clues,

912
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,660
so they put the case aside as the case of disappearance.

913
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,890
In our investigation,

914
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,940
we have found a few clues.

915
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,310
There was no Skynet project nine years ago.

916
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,300
But

917
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,850
there were surveillance cameras in this nightclub.

918
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
The criminal police group at that time

919
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,860
retrieved their internal surveillance videos.

920
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,830
We brought them here.

921
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,970
Look.

922
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,870
You two take a look.

923
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,780
It's him. It's Yue Wei when he was young.

924
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,700
But it's too vague.

925
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,690
We're just suspecting it.

926
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,750
We're not sure it's him.

927
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,800
If this person is Yue Wei,

928
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,080
he might be

929
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,520
related to this girl's disappearance.

930
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,730
But the girl's ID card is fake.

931
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,440
We can't get more information about her,

932
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,920
and we can't locate her.

933
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,980
We can only increase suspicion of Yue Wei.

934
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
It can't solve any problem.

935
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,660
One more thing.

936
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,820
If Yue Wei is a perverted killer,

937
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,520
according to behavior psychology,

938
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,210
he won't stop committing crimes.

939
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,700
He will only commit crimes more frequently.

940
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,140
If we take Liu Xiaoli's case

941
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,200
as his last case,

942
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,090
he has been quiet since then

943
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,690
and been driving his unofficial car without making troubles.

944
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,290
This doesn't meet

945
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,040
the characteristics of a serial killer.

946
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,880
Captain Luo, it's only been a while.

947
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,470
You...

948
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,530
So,

949
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,740
we had no other choice last time.

950
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,620
We can only strengthen our secret investigation on him.

951
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,820
Luo,

952
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,530
our station

953
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,600
has also discussed

954
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,550
this case.

955
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,910
I think Chen and Dawei's

956
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,490
direction of judgment is very accurate.

957
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,390
Of course, solving cases

958
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,270
is the task of your criminal police group.

959
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,140
If you need Balihe Police Station

960
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,110
to cooperate with you,

961
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,380
just say out.

962
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,630
We have added two surveillance cameras

963
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,360
where Yue Wei will pass in and out.

964
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,940
But we don't have

965
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,780
enough manpower.

966
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,200
I think...

967
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,700
Can I hand over the task

968
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,360
of surveillance videos to our station?

969
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,420
No problem.

970
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,670
Chief, leave it to us.

971
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,660
Okay.

972
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,500
Okay, it’s settled.

973
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,180
Thank you, Captain Luo.

974
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,170
Thank you. Thank you.

975
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,830
Brat, I've set up a trap for you.

976
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,000
Let's see if you can escape.

977
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,700
Are you playing games?

978
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,580
You're so obsessed.

979
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,270
What are you talking about?

980
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,100
How could I play games during working hours?

981
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,090
I'm investigating the cases.

982
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,610
You changed your mind?

983
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,530
Are you going to tell me?

984
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,010
The problem is

985
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,060
I don't think anyone can help me.

986
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,640
Don't think like that.

987
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,740
Tell me first.

988
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,140
Maybe the bystander knows it.

989
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,220
Something is actually wrong with my mom.
