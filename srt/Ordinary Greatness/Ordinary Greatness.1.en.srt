swap the personnel

54

and improve the allocation of human resources?

55

Besides,

173
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,680
do you think money is good?

174
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,580
Do you think

175
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,140
I'm as happy as you think?

176
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,700
You're wrong.

177
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,860
You don't understand it.

178
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,580
You know?

179
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,820
Don't let the baby cry anymore.

180
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,290
Your kid kicked me.

181
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,700
Don't let your baby cry anymore.

182

Don't be angry.

183

I'll beat you if you keep crying.

Be gentle to the baby.

185
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,500
Why are you so rude to your baby?

186
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,660
Can't you calm down your kid?

187
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,340
It's too noisy.

188
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
So noisy.

189
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,940
Please comfort your baby.

190
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,490
Forget it.

191
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,620
Don't be angry.

192
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,250
Are you really her grandma?

193
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,910
The baby keeps crying.

194
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,910
It's too noisy.

195
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,580
I'll beat you if you don't stop crying.

Are you really his grandma?

197
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,220
Are you a human trafficker?

198
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,860
It doesn't look like her own baby.

199
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,780
Look, she keeps covering the baby's mouth.

200
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,300
How can a grandma be like this?

201
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,060
That's right. Why do you keep covering her mouth?

202
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,190
I'll get off.

203
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,860
Call the police!

204
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,540
What are you doing?

205
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,100
I'm getting off.

206

Stop her!

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,980
Make way!

208

I'll handle it.

-Let me get off. -Madam.

213
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,740
Madam, I'm a policeman.

214
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,530
Don't panic.

215
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,020
Just make it clear.

216
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Let me get off.

217
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,420
Do you have any evidence

218
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,260
to prove your relationship with this child?

219
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,560
I-I-I don't.

220
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,460
I have.

221
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,880
But I didn't take it with me.

222
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,300
Have you gotten your ID card with you?

223
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,180
No, I haven't.

224
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,300
But the baby's crying so much.

225
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,210
Could it be that it's hungry?

226
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,820
How about you feed some milk to it first.

227
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,420
I-I-I have an ID card.

228
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,900
I mean, the baby's crying so much.

229
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,860
Maybe it's hungry.

230
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,970
You can feed some milk to him first.

231
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,740
I didn't bring any milk.

232
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,060
Let me get off.

233
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,700
She's definitely not the baby's grandma.

234
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,660
She must be a human trafficker.

235
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,500
She must be a human trafficker.

236
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,220
-She must be pretending. -Stop shouting.

237
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:12,940
Stop shouting, everyone.

238
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,500
Let this police officer handle it.

239
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,420
Sir.

240
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,060
Don't let her run away.

241
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,850
Please open the door.

242
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,100
I'll get them to the police car.

243
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,820
Okay.

244
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,210
Please be quiet.

245
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,100
I'll handle it.

246
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,180
I'm getting off now

247
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,740
and take her to wait for the police car.

248
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,300
You can go to work as usual, okay?

Officer,

250

please show me your police certificate.

251
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm a cadet and have no certificate.

252
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,060
No certificate?

253
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,380
How can a police officer have no certificate?

254
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,480
You liar. You must be her accomplice!

255
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,590
You must be a fake policeman.

256
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,330
He must be a fake policeman.

257

Don't forget to get those three...

261

Why are the paper shells still here?

262

Your mother

called us this morning,

300

asking us to take good care of you.

301

There's no need for her to call me?

302

Even if she doesn't call,

we will surely take good care of you.

No need to thank me.

We are a family.

From now on, you'll be Chief Cheng's disciple.

And he'll be your master, okay?

310
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,030
Your father was my master.

311
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,800
Now I'm her master.

312
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,970
This is somewhat a kind of inheritance.

313
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,020
Take her upstairs for a visit first.

314

How about I clean the yard together with them?

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,780
Go upstairs as I told you.

330

Go. Take a look first.

This way.

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,530
What are you doing?

340
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,670
Chief!

341
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,380
What are you doing?

342
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,360
We're setting up the rostrum.

343
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,620
What?

344
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,740
It's just a simple welcome ceremony.

345
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,970
No one will make a speech.

346
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,140
We should avoid such formalism.

347
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,500
You even got a speaker here?

348
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,660
Go back.

349
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,250
-Okay. -Go.

350
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,060
Xincheng, where are you going?

351
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,700
There's a suspected human trafficker at the Balihe bus stop.

352
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,970
A human trafficker?

353
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,340
There are human traffickers at the morning peak?

354
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,780
The crowd called 110.

355
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,940
I'll go check it out.

356
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,860
Okay.

357
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,210
T-T-Try

358
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,360
to resolve it on the spot as best as you can.

359
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,860
Try your best not to bring the criminal back.

360
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,220
-Okay? -Okay, I got it.

361
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,740
Okay, go ahead.

362
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,340
What's going on?

363
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,940
Being undisciplined

364
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,710
on the first day of work.

365
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,100
I told you I'm a policeman, but you didn't believe me.

366
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,930
You should depart now.

367
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,080
or passengers will be late for work.

368
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,050
It's okay.

369
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,820
Officer,

370
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,090
be sure to arrest that human trafficker.

371
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,810
You are Li Dawei?

372
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,890
Bro, you know me?

373
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,690
Who's your bro?

374
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,670
Li Dawei, Cadet in the Balihe Police Station

375
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,420
reports to you.

376
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,100
It must be fate for me to come to our station.

377
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,980
I can ride a police car on my first day of work.

378
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,330
You think yourself very capable, huh?

379
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,300
Yes.

380
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,070
I caught a suspect on my first day of work.

381
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,180
It's not bad, right?

382
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,720
Why a little bit indifferent...

383
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,680
Hello, Li Dawei.

384
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,500
Hello.

385
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,180
Instructor.

386
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,860
What’s wrong?

387
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,740
Well...

388
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,390
Help me find them.

389
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,090
Find what?

390
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,130
The director will be here soon.

391
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,660
Two new recruits haven't come to report yet.

392
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,340
What should we do?

393
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,680
Which two? Where can we find them?

394
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,840
You...

395
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,570
Right,

396
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,140
there must be their contact information

397
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,380
in our register.

398
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,220
Call them.

399
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,300
Yeah, right.

400
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,740
One is Li Dawei,

401
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,010
and the other is Yang Shu.

402
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,690
Okay.

403
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,460
Chief.

404
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,570
Chief.

405
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,750
This way.

406
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,620
What's going on?

407
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,940
Isn't the boy from the Xu family gonna be released?

408
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,370
Chief Cheng's afraid that the Qiao family will make trouble again.

409
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,500
What if the two families run into each other again?

410
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,720
Lay it aside for now.

411
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,100
After the welcome ceremony,

412
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,020
we can get him...

413
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,020
We'll talk about it after the director leaves.

414
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,650
Okay.

415
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,200
Wait.

416
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,820
We can't always avoid it.

417
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,840
We have to face it.

418
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,490
It has to be resolved anyway,

419
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,080
right?

420
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,850
They will have to meet anyhow

421
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,790
to get mediated face to face.

422
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,220
Ding.

423
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,810
Release the guy.

424
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,850
We'll mediate if there's any problem.

425
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,790
Understand?

426
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,760
Yes, Chief.

427
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,490
Chief!

428
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,020
Director Song is here.

429
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,020
Chief.

430
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,220
How is it going?

431
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,950
Have you found them?

432
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,870
There's no contact information of them

433
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,440
in the register.

434
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,660
Chief, what should we do?

435
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,740
The director's car is already here.

436
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,570
Yeah, well.

437
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,310
Why...

438
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,490
Why haven't they arrived yet?

439
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,130
It's coming.

440
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,840
Come, welcome him.

441
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,190
Director Song.

442
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,490
Get off.

443
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,160
Get off.

444
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,180
Director Song.

445
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,820
Director Song.

446
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Welcome home.

447
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,570
I picked up Yang Shu on the way here.

448
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,010
He's a Master of law in Peking University.

449
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,450
[Yang Shu, top student of Peking University, a Master of law]

450
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,450
[Ranking first in the civil service exam]

451
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,450
[always called as "little doctor"]

452
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,150
It's not easy for us to get him.

453
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,260
So, Chief Wang,

454
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,000
don't say that I won't care for Balihe anymore.

455
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,620
I'll leave the talent to you.

456
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,380
You're from Peking University?

457
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,020
If you don't care for Balihe, then who will?

458
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,640
You was also a member of the Balihe Station!

459
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,690
Doctor.

460
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,460
Welcome.

461
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,140
Welcome to our station.

462
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,100
Nice to meet you, Chief.

463
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,540
I'm a Master, not a doctor.

464
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,530
Never mind.

465
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,570
They're both high academic qualifications.

466
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,590
You're an elite anyway.

467
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,940
Look, you're handsome.

468
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,010
By the way, Director...

469
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,250
Everyone is here, let's start.

470
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,180
Well, I think...

471
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,320
how about we wait a little longer?

472
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:43,980
What's wrong?

473
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,170
There's still one not here yet.

474
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,310
Who?

475
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,000
The one that you...

476
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,250
additionally assigned here.

477
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,410
The additionally assigned one.

478
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,430
Well...

479
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,580
What should we do?

480
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,410
Wait? Or start?

481
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,240
I'll start?

482
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,570
Chief.

483
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,180
Go.

484
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,310
I shall go first.

485
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,060
What's wrong?

486
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:12,819
The suspect's brought here.

487
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,880
There must be a misunderstanding.

488
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,670
What?

489
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,760
Look.

490
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,180
Bro, Cadet Li Dawei.

491
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,089
Who's your bro?

492
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,500
Watch your mouth! This is the chief.

493
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,079
Get off.

494
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,880
This is ridiculous.

495
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,380
Xincheng, hurry up.

496
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,420
Take that person

497
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,550
-to the mediation room. -Okay.

498
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,790
And then attend the welcome ceremony right away.

499
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,580
Hurry up.

500
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,290
Chief, Cadet Li Dawei reports to you.

501
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,700
You are Li Dawei?

502
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,060
You still know to come, huh!

503
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,000
It was that on my way here...

504
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,290
Chief, I participated in this case.

505
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,580
Should I follow it up?

506
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,200
Shut up!

507
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,020
No matter what happened,

508
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,620
we'll talk about it

509
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,060
after the welcome ceremony.

510
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,060
Director Song from the branch is already here.

511
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,540
Attend your welcome ceremony.

512
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,300
Behave yourself.

513
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,860
Chief, the new guy is really nice.

514
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,420
He caught a suspect

515
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,460
on the way here.

516
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,100
See!

517
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
A talent!

518
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,380
Director.

519
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,420
Fall in.

520
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,500
Let's start.

521
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,060
Okay.

522
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,900
All of you.

523
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,580
Attention!

524
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,200
Dress right!

525
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,350
Eyes front!

526
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,560
Director,

527
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,180
all members of the Balihe Station are here.

528
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,200
Please give your instructions.

529
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,040
Li Dawei.

530
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,900
Zhao Jiwei.

531
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,410
Yang Shu.

532
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,770
Xia Jie.

533
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,430
Jie.

534
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,050
The year when your dad sacrificed,

535
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,120
you were only this tall.

536
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,460
I personally

537
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,170
took you from school to the hospital.

538
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,120
It's been ten years.

539
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,890
Come.

540
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,570
Some of you who came not long before

541
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,020
may not know.

542
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,920
Xia Jie is the daughter

543
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,580
of the former chief here, Xia Junxiong.

544
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,500
Ten years ago,

545
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,340
I was just an ordinary policeman

546
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,470
in this police station.

547
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,890
During a mission,

548
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,000
a criminal with a knife

549
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,270
came at me.

550
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,430
I had no time to dodge it.

551
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,580
But Xia Junxiong rushed forward

552
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,890
and blocked the knife for me.

553
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,210
I survived.

554
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,100
But Comrade Xia Junxiong...

555
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,830
Director,

556
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,500
today is a happy day.

557
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
Let's not talk about this.

558
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:49,860
Director Song,

559
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,260
I promise you,

560
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,730
all members in the Blihe Station

561
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,040
will be sure to well protect Xia Jie.

562
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,180
We will let her grow up in the place

563
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,320
where our former chief fought.

564
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,300
I'm relieved to hear that.

565
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,500
Return!

566
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,020
Comrades,

567
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,840
give a big round of applause.

568
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,580
Welcome Director Song to speak for us.

569
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,590
Actually,

570
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,250
I have nothing to say.

571
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,880
The lack of the young force

572
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,260
has always been a headache in our bureau.

573
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,210
Chief Wang.

574
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,470
Yes.

575
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,910
You used to be my master.

576
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,920
Now you are the chief.

577
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,580
I'll leave these four young people to you.

578
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,390
Be sure to train them well.

579
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,110
Okay, leave it to me.

580
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,100
I'll complete the mission.

581
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,380
Next, let's get to the point.

582
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,740
The ranking of the second quarter

583
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,180
will be announced soon.

584
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,060
The public satisfaction rate

585
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,340
of your station

586
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,580
is quite high.

587
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,120
93.4%.

588
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,350
There are 163 police stations in the city.

589
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,700
And you are ranked 144.

590
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,590
I know you must have

591
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,430
a hundred reasons for me.

592
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,650
Like, uh...  the personnel composition is complex,

593
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
and socioeconomic activities abound.

594
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,550
And um...

595
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,330
what you're responsible for is an suburban area.

596
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,100
Nod?

597
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,500
No excuse is accepted over the public satisfaction rate.

598
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,050
The truth is that your ranking hasn't risen.

599
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,380
There's one thing that you all know.

600
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,150
Your senior Chief, Wang Shouyi,

601
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,830
is already 54 years old

602
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,570
and will retire next year.

603
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,590
Can you bear

604
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,150
to see him retire

605
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,390
with such low rankings?

606
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,580
Who?

607
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,670
What's going on?

608
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,410
You know about this.

609
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,180
The Qiao family, don't you remember?

610
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,240
The Qiao family's daughter

611
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,300
was in a relationship

612
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,250
with the Xu family's son.

613
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,690
After an argument,

614
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,110
t-t-they were to break up.

615
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,790
Yet the Qiao family's daughter

616
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,050
tried to commit suicide for many times.

617
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,100
That boy

618
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,390
thought it was real at first.

619
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,460
Later he found that she was pretending to commit suicide

620
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,580
and asked to break up with her.

621
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,720
He didn't expect

622
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,970
the daughter of the Qiao family really committed suicide.

623
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,320
Then the Qiao family burst into anger,

624
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,740
forcing us to sentence the boy to death.

625
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,240
Wait, I have asked for your advice

626
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,820
over this issue.

627
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,740
You told me to detain him if necessary,

628
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,690
so I did so as what you said.

629
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,600
But,

630
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,710
since it didn't get approved,

631
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,880
I certainly can't detain him anymore,

632
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,190
and can only release him.

633
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,690
So you just let them make a scene like this?

634
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,230
What can I do if I don't?

635
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,900
I can't detain the boy.

636
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,080
And it doesn't work to persuade them.

637
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,830
What's worse is that the Qiao family

638
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,350
has been complaining online every day,

639
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,270
saying that our police station

640
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,500
bent the law for personal gains regardless of their daughter's death.

641
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,690
They kept dialing "12345"[informant's hot-line telephone].

642
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,140
It was all because of the Qiao family.

643
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,590
It was just because

644
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,540
their informing against us

645
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
that two points of our satisfaction rate got deducted.

646
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,480
With these two points,

647
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,610
we would have made it to the top 100 in the city.

648
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,780
Chief.

649
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,780
Chief.

650
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,000
Chief.

651
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,710
They're really fighting this time.

652
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,290
Looks like they're gonna smash something.

653
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,050
They are fighting!

654
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,230
How could you look so happy?

655
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,990
Close your mouth.

656
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,010
He...

657
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,700
This is the way he always looks.

658
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,790
Um... Chief Cheng,

659
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,030
come to be with the director.

660
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,620
The rest of you, go back to your work.

661
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,670
Ding, come with me.

662
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,200
Director Song, let's go to the office

663
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,000
and have some water.

664
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,150
My daughter

665
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,080
was killed by your son.

666
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,790
Get out of the way!

667
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,300
If it weren't for your son's indifference...

668
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,230
All right.

669
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,520
Sir, calm down.

670
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,270
Calm down.

671
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,190
What are you doing?

672
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,590
Stop filming.

673
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,580
Go get help.

674
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,590
Go!

675
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,030
Stop fighting!

676
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,090
Move!

677
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,100
Stop fighting!

678
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,140
Get down!

679
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,780
Stop fighting!

680
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,660
Get down!

681
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,530
Dismiss.

682
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,680
Stop filming.

683
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,020
Listen to me.

684
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,810
Shut up!

685
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,170
Listen to me.

686
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,900
You've lost your daughter,

687
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,770
and we understand your pain.

688
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,690
But,

689
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,840
about Xu Ziming,

690
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,850
his behavior constitute neither an illegal act,

691
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,750
nor crime.

692
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,810
We've criticized and lectured him.

693
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,900
And you've refused

694
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,760
the economic compensation.

695
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,350
Then what else do you want the police to do?

696
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,610
Why are you still doing this?

697
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,960
Don't take the law as an excuse.

698
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,840
He didn't save my daughter.

699
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,270
He is the murderer.

700
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,600
As long as he's alive,

701
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,010
I'll make him uncomfortable.

702
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,880
Let me tell you.

703
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,690
Xu Ziming indeed didn't save her,

704
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,100
but that constitutes neither crime

705
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,960
nor an illegal act.

706
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,290
But you assaulted and intentionally hurt others

707
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,550
and disrupted public service.

708
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,860
If you keep doing this,

709
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,090
I'll punish you according to law.

710
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,040
My daughter has died!

711
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,450
Don't fight!

712
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,020
Stop!

713
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,500
What are you doing?

714
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,300
Calm down.

715
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,540
This is ridiculous!

716
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,110
Calm down.

717
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,130
Arrest them all!

718
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,560
Get them controlled.

719
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,360
Calm down.

720
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,340
Calm down.

721
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,300
Director.

722
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,160
Don't arrest them.

723
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,050
We can mediate a settlement.

724
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,590
This is how you serve as a chief?

725
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,420
What else can I do?

726
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,590
For such a thing,

727
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,610
both sides have their own reasons.

728
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,030
We did everything we could.

729
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,690
Director.

730
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,390
You've been in the bureau for too long

731
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,570
and have forgotten the condition here.

732
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,630
Master.

733
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,540
I still call you master.

734
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,150
I know what you're thinking about.

735
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,020
What can I think about?

736
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,570
Are you blaming me

737
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,030
for not stopping them

738
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,010
and letting them make a scene instead?

739
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,420
It's not like that,

740
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,480
my director.

741
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,860
Don't you know

742
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,950
what era it is now?

743
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,700
It's the era of the mobile internet.

744
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,310
A we-media era!

745
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,930
When the police are on duty,

746
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
everyone around could film with their phones

747
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,680
from all angles

748
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,830
to monitor us,

749
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,470
thus able to easily affect the public sentiment,

750
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,310
right?

751
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,350
Look, for this family,

752
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,190
one is dead.

753
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,240
What about the other family?

754
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,870
What was it called?

755
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,990
Oh, social death,

756
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,330
no longer being accepted

757
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,390
by the wider society.

758
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,210
If we use force,

759
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,800
we may

760
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,790
make a big fuss online.

761
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,490
Master,

762
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,850
is it necessary for you

763
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,230
to beat around the bush with me?

764
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,630
I...

765
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,980
What do you mean

766
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,970
to arrange all this for me?

767
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,040
Are you trying to tell me

768
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,150
it's because of this

769
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,280
that your satisfaction rate is so low?

770
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,510
Or something else?

771
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,300
Like how hard your work is

772
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,160
or how badly you're in need of more personnel?

773
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,920
What's all this for?

774
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,030
Director,

775
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,530
how could I arrange this for you?

776
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,790
It's just that you happened to see it.

777
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,290
Nonsense.

778
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,150
You just released the guy, right?

779
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,730
No, not me...

780
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,350
If you had released him later

781
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,020
or let him leave from the back door,

782
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,210
I couldn't have seen this mess.

783
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,600
You don't know.

784
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,350
Fine, it's my fault.

785
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,300
I was totally overwhelmed

786
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,360
by the welcome ceremony for the new recruits

787
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,830
and forgot about this issue.

788
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,600
Come on.

789
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,110
I know you too well.

790
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,140
You're always good

791
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,470
at sadfishing, aren't you!

792
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,490
What?

793
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,880
What sadfishing!

794
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,250
What else do you want me to do?

795
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,000
Enough.

796
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,450
You can say whatever you want.

797
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,130
I've entrusted the four rookies to you.

798
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,050
No more excuse

799
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,280
like a lack of personnel,

800
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,550
okay?

801
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,140
Okay.

802
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,490
Before you retire,

803
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,860
be sure to raise your public satisfaction rate.

804
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,980
Yes, get it raised.

805
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,060
Next time, we'll try to make it to the top 100.

806
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,020
What?

807
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,860
Top 100?

808
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,780
There are just over a hundred police stations.

809
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,060
Your ambition is to make it to the top 100, master?

810
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,340
If you have no intention to make progress,

811
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,280
then I'll take the four rookies back.

812
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,000
Don't.

813
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,550
Don't take them away.

814
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,620
I'll try my best, okay?

815
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,410
I will.

816
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,840
Don't just say that.

817
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,390
Can't you carry forward the Fengqiao spirit,

818
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,170
improve the working mechanism,

819
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,630
enhance learning and training,

820
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,740
and implement the Fengqiao spirit to the full

821
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,380
during your work?

822
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,420
Yes or no, master?

823
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,460
Yes, yes.

824
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,020
Director, don't worry.

825
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,590
I'm leaving.

826
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,320
Wait.

827
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,940
Director.

828
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,540
What?

829
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,030
About the top student from Peking University

830
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,660
that came together with you,

831
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,760
does he have any powerful connections?

832
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,830
Tell me the truth.

833
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,310
I've told you.

834
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,180
He was just picked up on the way.

835
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,710
Really?

836
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,820
Okay, take care.

837
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,840
Okay.

838
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,720
Chief! Chief!

839
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,530
What's wrong?

840
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,910
It's confirmed.

841
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,490
The old lady's not a human trafficker.

842
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,960
Isn't that good?

843
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,370
Just release that old lady, hurry.

844
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,820
But...

845
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,200
The old lady's son came to make trouble.

846
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,860
Bro,

847
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,130
I heard that you arrested a human trafficker today.

848
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,120
You've done a deed of merit before you came to work.

849
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,900
She's still a suspect

850
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,250
under investigation.

851
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,100
Can you tell me the details?

852
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,990
Nothing serious.

853
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,730
I met a human trafficker on the bus.

854
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,060
I saw through her,

855
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,990
and caught her.

856
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,470
Awesome, bro.

857
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,400
[Strictly enforce the law, enforce the law for the people]

858
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,180
Strictly enforce the law.

859
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,100
This is right.

860
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,240
Such person certainly should be detained.

861
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,380
It's better to be detained early than late.

862
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,990
So what?

863
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,790
The fundamental contradiction is still unresolved.

864
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,570
But we can't sacrifice principles for reconciliation.

865
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,460
Do the police deserve to be bullied?

866
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,270
There's nothing wrong with that.

867
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,040
The police have the duty to resolve contradictions

868
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,310
instead of aggravating them.

869
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,110
What about the current condition?

870
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,220
Hasn't the contradiction been aggravated?

871
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,100
Hasn't the guy been detained?

872
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,580
No wonder that the Balihe Station ranked No.144.

873
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,320
In my opinion,

874
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,830
it should be at the bottom.

875
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,320
What?

876
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,760
Your remarks are really marvelous, huh!

877
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
How about you

878
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,940
replace me as the chief?

879
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,840
Chief...

880
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,980
I mean

881
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,490
being at the bottom can get us motivated

882
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,300
to make progress.

883
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,770
I haven't scolded you yet.

884
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,470
Being late on the first day of work, huh?

885
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,860
You caught a human trafficker, right?

886
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,670
And was almost caught as a compliance instead!

887
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,110
But the person you caught is not a human trafficker!

888
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,980
Not a human trafficker?

889
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,170
That old lady is the baby's real grandma?

890
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,310
Impossible.

891
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,950
Her families have come here

892
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,560
to get even with you!

893
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,630
Go to the mediation room

894
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,820
and apologize to them.

895
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,170
Still feeling good about yourself?

896
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,490
What's going on?

897
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,020
Yeah, right.

898
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,200
We totally understand.

899
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,200
Chief.

900
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,290
You go on.

901
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,320
Sorry.

902
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,860
Mr. Shen, look.

903
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,100
We've figured out the real situation.

904
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,800
It's indeed a misunderstanding.

905
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,120
And sorry for terrifying the madam.

906
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,230
We're really sorry for it.

907
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,680
But since we received the call from the masses,

908
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,220
we must

909
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,010
follow the procedures.

910
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,380
Misunderstanding? How could you misunderstand?

911
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,180
There are so many elders with babies on the street,

912
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,220
why don't you suspect them

913
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,170
but just suspect my mom?

914
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,180
Why do you suspect my mom?

915
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,010
Because she's poorly-dressed?

916
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,140
Of course not.

917
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,570
You police

918
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,120
arrest people with snobbish eyes?

919
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,270
Mr. Shen,

920
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,740
you must be saying that out of anger.

921
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,220
We police never

922
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,280
make judgments

923
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,620
according to

924
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760
the clothing or appearance

925
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,930
of the litigants.

926
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,260
You can rest assured about it.

927
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,000
Then you think as long as a baby's crying,

928
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,190
it must be abducted, right?

929
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,690
Crying babies are all over the street.

930
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,420
Do you mean that human traffickers are also everywhere?

931
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,100
Sir.

932
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,220
Bro,

933
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,580
let me apologize to you first.

934
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,020
It was indeed a misunderstanding.

935
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,000
But the situation then

936
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,550
was indeed misleading.

937
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,730
Your baby

938
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,960
was crying on the bus.

939
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,020
This madam didn't comfort it,

940
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,360
but frightened it instead.

941
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,250
What do you mean?

942
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,150
Calm down. Sit down.

943
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,790
Don't scare the baby.

944
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,380
Stop arguing.

945
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Don't scare the baby.

946
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,370
Stop arguing.

947
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,520
-Yes. -Stop arguing.

948
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,690
My mom's unable to speak Mandarin.

949
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,770
She's a bit clumsy of speech.

950
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,250
That's how she talks.

951
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,330
Should that be counted as scaring the baby?

952
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,090
Yes, I understand.

953
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,740
But

954
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,580
I didn't mean anything else.

955
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,560
I just wanted to confirm

956
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,260
her identity and her relationship with the baby.

957
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,280
But your mother neither brought her ID card

958
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,620
nor anything else

959
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,150
that could prove her relationship with the baby, even...

960
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,630
Stop making excuses.

961
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:49,850
Stop talking.

962
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,910
Stop arguing.

963
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,690
Look, you scared my mom.

964
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,580
My mom is in poor health.

965
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,290
She gets panicked easily.

966
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,660
Sheng,

967
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,010
the police meant well.

968
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,490
How could it be?

969
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,000
When there's human trafficking,

970
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,060
if everyone turn a blind eye to it,

971
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,680
and keeps out of it,

972
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,600
then what should we do

973
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,350
if it happens to us one day?

974
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,550
My legs are weak every time I think about it.

975
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,620
Dawei, come on.

976
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,460
Li Dawei.

977
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,060
Thanks for the lady's understanding.

978
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,740
It's nice of you. Thanks.

979
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,000
Thank you for understanding.

980
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,980
Let's go home, please.

981
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,640
This...

982
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,440
-Let's go home. -That's...

983
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,300
That's it?

984
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,870
Of course.

985
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,020
You shouldn't have

986
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,540
let mom bring the baby out.

987
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,480
Slow down.

988
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,440
It's originally your fault.

989
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,260
Ridiculous.

990
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,550
Come.

991
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,590
-Don't leave anything behind. -Okay, thanks.

992
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,430
-Slowly. -This way.

993
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,690
Thank you.

994
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:39,940
Dawei. Dawei.

995
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,880
Okay.

996
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,980
Come, see them off.

997
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,060
Chief.

998
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,630
Go patrol!

999
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,470
Chief! Chief!

1000
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,900
It's done.

1001
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,139
What are you laughing at?

1002
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,170
How dare you laugh?

1003
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,110
I asked you to comfort the family.

1004
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,290
But you even intensified the conflict!

1005
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,230
Luckily, you met

1006
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,500
a reasonable family member

1007
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,860
and didn't get complained.

1008
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,280
It's your first day at work.

1009
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,179
You didn't grace the station,

1010
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,179
but caused me trouble instead.

1011
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,400
But Chief,

1012
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,739
it's all settled.

1013
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,909
What's settled?

1014
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,750
Li Dawei.

1015
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,850
I haven't introduced myself.

1016
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,659
I'm Instructor Ye Wei.

1017
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,080
Hello, Instructor. I'm Li Dawei.

1018
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,699
Dawei.

1019
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,610
you still have a long way to go.

1020
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,760
You have a lot to learn.

1021
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,790
Yes.

1022
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,080
Yang Shu,

1023
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,830
Let me tell you.

1024
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,290
Our station's condition is simple.

1025
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,909
If you need anything,

1026
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,500
do feel free

1027
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,220
to tell us, okay?

1028
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,470
Have our chief learned Sichuan opera before?

1029
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,160
His countenance changes so fast!

1030
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,350
Oh, I forgot to introduce.

1031
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,020
This is Instructor Ye Wei.

1032
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,170
Instructor.

1033
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,830
Tell us if you need anything.

1034
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,970
Chief, Instructor.

1035
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,630
You don't have to be so polite.

1036
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,460
You don't need to care for me.

1037
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,430
No, that doesn't work.

1038
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,340
Don't say so, we surely need to care for you.

1039
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,350
Yes, we surely will.

1040
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:21,730
Chief,

1041
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,540
there's too much surveillance footage for me to check,

1042
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,230
could you

1043
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,870
find someone to help me?

1044
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,030
Well, the cleaning is finished?

1045
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,680
Yes, sir.

1046
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,250
There is a very difficult task now.

1047
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,360
Who's willing to take it?

1048
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,030
I'm willing to.

1049
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,480
Okay, you then.

1050
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,780
Let me introduce.

1051
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,590
Senior Officer Zhang Zhijie,

1052
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,330
mainly in charge of the community work.

1053
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,010
You

1054
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,480
follow Zhijie

1055
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,760
to check the surveillance footage.

1056
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,050
According to the residents in this neighborhood,

1057
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,410
their baby diapers kept being stolen.

1058
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,660
So we're asked to investigate it thoroughly, got it?

1059
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,370
Zhijie has collected five-hundred-hour

1060
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,200
surveillance footage.

1061
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,060
You go help him look for some clues.

1062
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,550
Check the surveillance footage to look for diapers?

1063
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,800
You...

1064
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,450
Why are you laughing?

1065
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,480
Go ahead.

1066
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,630
Okay. Come with me.

1067
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,920
Zhao, this way.

1068
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,720
This way.

1069
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,100
Chief.

1070
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,200
Xincheng, what's wrong with you again?

1071
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,310
What's wrong?

1072
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,200
I've told you earlier.

1073
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,860
Chief.

1074
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,030
Gao Chao. Aren't you off today?

1075
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,820
-Why are you here again? -I...

1076
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,810
The time I arrived home,

1077
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,620
I received news.

1078
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,860
Thus I'm back here for calling the staff.

1079
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,140
It's news about that murderer.

1080
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,070
According to the informant,

1081
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,300
he just went back home.

1082
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,260
Okay.

1083
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,940
Take more men there.

1084
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,670
-Well... -Chief, can I go?

1085
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,580
The newcomers?

1086
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,310
Yes, they're newcomers.

1087
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,090
Let me introduce.

1088
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,930
Gao Chao,

1089
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,100
Deputy Chief, in charge of the criminal investigation.

1090
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,680
Chief Gao, I'm Cadet Li Dawei.

1091
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,710
Chief Gao, I'm Cadet Xia Jie.

1092
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,310
Chief Gao, I'm Cadet Yang Shu.

1093
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,100
Young people

1094
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,530
always want to try something new.

1095
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,860
Since he petitioned for it...

1096
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,440
How about this?

1097
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,550
Chief, let me take him to get some experience?

1098
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,620
He... fine, I'll give you the chance to make up for your mistake.

1099
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,100
Xincheng.

1100
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,550
How about you take some men

1101
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,870
-and go with Chief Gao? -Chief, n-n-no need to do so.

1102
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,640
Cheng just got off the night shift, right?

1103
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,750
Forget it.

1104
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,420
Chief, you know it... I can only cause trouble if I go.

1105
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,160
And my neck has been aching these days.

1106
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,830
I don't want to go.

1107
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,600
Well,

1108
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,260
Li Dawei,

1109
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,670
whether you can go

1110
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,480
depends on whether Officer Chen

1111
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,010
is willing to take you with him.

1112
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,080
Officer Chen, I'm skillful enough.

1113
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,510
I can even massage.

1114
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,920
Chief, I also want to go.

1115
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,350
You...

1116
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:01,830
Chief.

1117
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,300
Can I go?

1118
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,820
College students are the treasures of the bureau.

1119
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,210
You can't send them to the front line.

1120
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,440
Don't make trouble for me.

1121
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,810
This mission

1122
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,340
is quite dangerous.

1123
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,040
So you'd better not go.

1124
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,320
Chief, it's because it's dangerous

1125
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,980
that I should go together to get trained.

1126
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,360
I'm here to get trained

1127
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,270
not just for packaging myself.

1128
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,450
Chief, I'm not afraid of danger either.

1129
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,480
It's good for you two to think so.

1130
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,920
Good. Good.

1131
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:35,990
Good.

1132
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,660
Yang Shu, you go.

1133
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,550
Chief Gao.

1134
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,890
Let me introduce.

1135
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,490
Yang Shu, from Peking University.

1136
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,400
Doctor.

1137
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,460
He's the treasure of our bureau.

1138
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,130
You know?

1139
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,060
Let him stand in the back when it's dangerous.

1140
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,700
Do protect him well.

1141
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,390
Okay, don't worry.

1142
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,100
Don't worry, Chief. I'll be there.

1143
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,160
I'll protect our treasure.

1144
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,460
I can protect myself.

1145
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,780
Director, what about me?

1146
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,750
You...

1147
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
Well, here's the thing.

1148
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,930
I'll take them to get the equipment.

1149
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,620
Okay.

1150
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,940
Qizi, you guys get changer into your casual clothes.

1151
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,500
Go.

1152
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,890
Chief, Xia Jie actually…

1153
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,060
Do you go or not?

1154
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:04,880
If you don't,

1155
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,920
then I'll keep you here.

1156
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,980
I'll go.

1157
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,020
You talk too much.

1158
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,300
Take care!

1159
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,970
Chief.

1160
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,170
What's wrong?

1161
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,080
Please let me go with them.

1162
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,740
Jie.

1163
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,130
Don't go, okay?

1164
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,450
Chief, I'm a police officer too.

1165
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,330
You are a girl.

1166
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,140
But you can't always let me hide behind

1167
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,290
when there's danger.

1168
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,160
I...

1169
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,300
I'll ask...

1170
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,660
[Mom]

1171
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,740
Look, Jie,

1172
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,580
in the future,

1173
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,450
there will be many chances to catch bad guys,

1174
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,340
right?

1175
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,700
It's your first day at work.

1176
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
Don't make your mom worry.

1177
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,380
Go back and rest early.

1178
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,610
Go.

1179
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,930
Chief.

1180
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,130
You scared me.

1181
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,400
Are you going to

1182
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,580
let me lead the additionally assigned guy?

1183
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,300
You think too much.

1184
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,900
What do you mean?

1185
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
You must be lying to me.

1186
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:05,940
Lying to you?

1187
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,710
How could I?

1188
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,350
Fine, stop thinking about it.

1189
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,170
Go now.

1190
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,300
Go back to your work, hurry.

1191
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:11,850
Last time I...

1192
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,750
Go now, hurry.

1193
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,730
Go.

1194
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Go, hurry.

1195
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,110
Remember to care for the cadets!

1196
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,980
Got it.

1197
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,520
Listen,

1198
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,410
you must well keep

1199
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,910
your body-worn cameras and handcuffs,

1200
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,980
especially when there are many people during the actions.

1201
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,800
You must well keep your weapons and equipment.

1202
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,190
Not to mention other weapons,

1203
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,820
just the handcuffs,

1204
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,560
though not expensive,

1205
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,020
have serial numbers.

1206
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,930
If you get yours lost, then it'll cause you trouble.

1207
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,640
Got it?

1208
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,470
Yes.

1209
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,480
Excuse me.

1210
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,870
You first.

1211
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,680
Has everyone gotten your equipment?

1212
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,720
Has everyone gotten your equipment?

1213
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,130
Besides,

1214
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,900
you must obey the order at the scene

1215
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,070
and follow commands.

1216
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,460
Always be alert and be careful.

1217
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,980
I'll only emphasize it once.

1218
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,910
Keep it in mind.

1219
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,890
Be careful. Remember it.

1220
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,740
Yes.

1221
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,820
Remember what Chief Gao said.

1222
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,720
Safety comes first.

1223
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,020
Got it?

1224
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,890
Yes.

1225
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,570
Yes.

1226
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,360
Sign here.

1227
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,340
Hello, mom.

1228
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,950
What's up? I'm working.

1229
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,050
Jie.

1230
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,380
Did Wang Shouyi and his colleagues

1231
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,370
take special care of you?

1232
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,160
Mom, how many people

1233
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,310
have you called today?

1234
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,150
What? Someone said something?

1235
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,310
No one said anything.

1236
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,190
And they didn't need to say anything.

1237
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,370
Even a fool can tell.

1238
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,140
Jie, how can you talk to me like that?

1239
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,750
Mom, can you stop

1240
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,380
calling those in the station again?

1241
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,030
It's just the first day of work.

1242
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,790
They already can tell that I'm treated differently.

1243
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,440
Isn't that good?

1244
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,850
They should take special care of you.

1245
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,530
Mom.

1246
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,450
All right.

1247
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,910
Jie, come back early today.

1248
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,350
I want to eat seafood.

1249
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,770
Bring some fresh abalones when you come back.

1250
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,050
Fine, I'll see.

1251
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,080
What do you mean?

1252
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,320
If they dare to let you work overtime,

1253
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,310
I'll call Wang Shouyi.

1254
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,460
Okay, that's it.

1255
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,070
Mom, why you...

1256
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,930
The suspect we're catching today

1257
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,140
is called Ding Dayong.

1258
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,380
He killed two persons

1259
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,650
and is the most wanted criminal of our department.

1260
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,380
Don't act rashly.

1261
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,900
Do not take actions unless ordered.

1262
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,620
Action.

1263

[Body-worn camera of Team Two]

1264
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,620
Sit down.

1265
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,830
Hurry up.

1266
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:42,800
Go, go, go.

1267
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,620
It's right ahead.

1268
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,270
Hurry.

1269
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,470
Give me back my son! Give me back my son!

1270
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,630
Step back. Police.

1271
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,050
-Back off. -Release him.

1272
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,990
Back off! We're from the police station.

1273
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,080
