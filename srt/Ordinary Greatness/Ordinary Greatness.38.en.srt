As soon as I got off the call with you,

two cases came up at once.

Have a seat.

11
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,420
One of the cases involves a murdered victim.

12
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,940
How could there still be so many criminals

13
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,820
as we've kept fighting crime？

14
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,170
That's exactly why the police are needed.

There occurred another missing prostitute case.

I'm sure that

it definitely has something to do

Look.

23
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,360
This is recorded by the monitor at the entrance of the nightclub

where the girl used to work.

25

Look at this car.

I'll zoom it in.

27
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,060
Look at its license plate.

28
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,770
Yue Wei's car.

29

To rewind it and you can see

30
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,680
this girl came out of the nightclub.

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,300
Two minutes later,

32
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,640
Yue Wei's car went after her.

33

We didn't find this girl

34
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,120
in the security video of the next intersection.

35
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,780
Obviously,

36
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,260
the girl must have gotten into Yue Wei's car.

37
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,579
Captain Luo,

38
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,640
you just used the word "another" when mentioning this case.

39
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,110
Does that mean there were other cases like this before?

40
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,780
Actually, in May,

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,380
we received a report.

42
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,060
Since we were not sure about it,

43
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,970
we didn't inform you of it.

44
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,320
That girl worked in the bath center.

45
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,260
Near the Spring Festival holiday,

46
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,780
her family thought she wouldn't come back home

47
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,060
while the bath center thought

48
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,700
she wouldn't come back to work after the holiday.

49
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,060
So, no one reported it.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,310
Until May,

51
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,490
since her family couldn't reach her,

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,540
they went to the bath center to look for her

53
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,300
and found that the girl was missing.

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,380
It's been over three months.

55
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,460
We couldn't find the security video

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,490
from that time.

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,980
We just found no evidence

58
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,460
proving that it was related to Yue Wei.

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,300
We don't even know

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,410
if this girl really went missing.

61
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,700
Thus,

62
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,230
we didn't inform you of it.

63
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,660
Captain Luo, you said it was near the Spring Festival holiday.

64
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,860
Master.

65
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,540
We were tailing him near the Spring Festival.

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,790
Could it be that this girl was just in his car at that time?

67
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,340
You mean he might go up the mountain

68
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,060
to deal with the body?

69
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,870
Didn't you two find nothing

70
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,530
when you went to his hometown?

71
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,170
Yes.

72
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,090
There was really no useful findings

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,850
that could be linked together as evidence.

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,020
Now, it seems that

75
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,810
we might have missed something.

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,200
But Luo,

77
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,690
one thing is for sure.

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,420
If it's really Yue Wei,

79
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,650
then it means that we are facing

80
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,290
a very difficult criminal.

81
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,409
He used to work in our public security system.

82
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,020
He has strong anti-investigation ability.

83
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,070
And that's why he can keep committing crimes

84
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,659
for so many years

85
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,930
without being caught.

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,670
I invited you two here this time...

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,190
Come.

88
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,780
Firstly,

89
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,790
we need to inform you

90
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,700
about the latest progress of the case.

91
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,430
Secondly,

92
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,540
I want to ask you,

93
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,250
have you been checking the video

94
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,860
recorded by the monitor at Yue Wei's door?

95
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,610
Yes.

96
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,690
Is there anything unusual with him recently?

97
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,300
No.

98
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,490
He still drives his unlicensed taxi every day from early morning

99
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,400
and comes back home at night.

100
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,410
It's the same as before.

101
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,100
Yes.

102
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,010
Did you see anyone else in the car?

103
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,780
I think I didn't see it.

104
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,460
We'll go recheck the video.

105
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,100
We've been tailing him for a long time.

106
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,060
If there was someone else,

107
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,740
I think I should have found something.

108
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,900
Anyway,

109
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,460
he's very good at anti-investigation.

110
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,710
He knew there was a monitor in front of his house,

111
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,370
and wouldn't take the risk

112
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,480
to commit crimes there.

113
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,010
That's not his style.

114
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,620
Then,

115
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,780
where would he commit crimes?

116
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,610
In his car?

117
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,250
In his car!

118
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,410
It should be in his car.

119
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,940
We have tailed him for so long

120
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,940
and found that his car

121
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,380
is really like his home.

122
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,730
He drives wherever he goes.

123
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,740
And when he's in the car...

124
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
Let's put it this way.

125
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,340
He would be in his car the whole day.

126
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,450
So, I think

127
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,690
the car to him is the most familiar

128
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,100
and the safest place.

129
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,740
Well, I'll get the search warrant

130
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,180
to search his car.

131
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,220
Captain Luo.

132
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,250
I don't think it's a good idea.

133
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,909
As you can see,

134
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,930
apart from

135
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,170
some flashing-by scenes recorded in the security video,

136
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,340
there isn't

137
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,460
any actual evidence.

138
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,580
If we make such a fuss,

139
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,980
he may get alerted...

140
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,210
Chen,

141
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,780
then what's your plan?

142
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,240
Yue Wei always appears in the entertainment venues.

143
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,410
Where has he often gone recently?

144
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,500
Have we learned of it?

145
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,220
Sleepless Bar?

146
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,370
Yes.

147
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,260
Turn it width-ways.

148
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,260
Get the sand shoveled inside.

149
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,380
Dude.

150
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,860
What's going on?

151
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,960
Road construction.

152
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,930
It's not allowed to park here.

153
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,180
Where should I park it?

154
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,450
Over there.

155
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,130
Green Island Building, underground parking garage.

156
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,850
Wei sir is here.

157
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,590
This...

158
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,480
What's wrong, Wei sir?

159
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
It's not allowed to park here?

160
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,060
Yes, the road's being repaired today.

161
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,940
Green Island Building is too far from here.

162
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
I even have to take a detour.

163
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,660
Sir,

164
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,540
shall I park the car for you?

165
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,670
Can you drive?

166
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,220
Don't get Wei sir's car damaged.

167
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,540
I've parked cars for others before.

168
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,460
Good for you.

169
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,660
No problem.

170
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,300
Let's go, sir.

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:27,970
Come.

172
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,789
Just remember,

173
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,539
don't get the sand to the middle.

174
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,220
Get it inside.

175
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,700
Be careful.

176
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,220
Don't worry.

177
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,140
-Come, sir. -Let's go.

178
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,100
How is it, Jianjun?

179
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,300
Chen, Captain Luo.

180
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,900
Thank you.

181
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,620
You're welcome.

182
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,260
We have to hurry up.

183
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
He's smart.

184
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,890
I'm afraid he'll realize it soon.

185
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,540
Okay.

186
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,470
Come on.

187
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,410
-Did it go well? -Jianjun.

188
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,730
Jianjun, how about this.

189
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,660
You go back first.

190
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,340
Maybe he will soon scent this.

191
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,220
Then you should bring him here.

192
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,180
We'll finish this in a short time.

193
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,780
Okay.

194
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,780
I'm leaving.

195
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,420
Okay.

196
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,740
Be careful.

197
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,810
Be careful, Mr. Cao.

198
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,570
Come, sir.

199
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,500
Sir, sit here.

200
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,370
I'll get you a glass of water.

201
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,540
Call me if you need anything.

202
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,100
Wei sir.

203
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,140
Here, have some water.

204
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,620
Okay.

205
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,260
Call me if you need anything.

206
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,770
Okay.

207
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,530
I must have lost my mind!

208
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,420
Waiter.

209
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,890
Here, here.

210
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,140
Hello.

211
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,260
Is it fixing the tube here?

212
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,750
Yes, they suddenly came to fix it today.

213
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,020
Do you have a security guard here?

214
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,940
What security guard?

215
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,890
Well,

216
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,140
his skin is rough

217
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,660
and a bit dark, and he wears a hat.

218
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,580
Sir.

219
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,180
Your car key.

220
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,570
I'm over there.

221
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,030
Tell me if you want to leave.

222
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,090
I'll drive it back for you.

223
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,360
Captain Luo, is it almost done?

224
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,150
Check carefully. Be quick.

225
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,080
Sir, something else?

226
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,340
Where did you park the car?

227
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,380
The underground parking lot of the Green Island Building.

228
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,540
I'll drive it back for you.

229
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,490
No need.

230
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,380
I'm leaving. Take me there.

231
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,340
This way, please.

232
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,780
Let's go.

233
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,050
It's in the sub-level 3.

234
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,960
What? Why did you park it there?

235
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,380
Here's the thing.

236
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,370
This is a parking lot we borrowed.

237
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,130
We're only allowed to park in the sub-level 3.

238
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,890
How about

239
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,820
I drive it here for you?

240
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,500
You can just wait...

241
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,140
No need.

242
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,710
Let's take the lift to go to the sub-level 3.

243
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,130
No, we can't.

244
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,700
The elevator is under repair. We can't take it.

245
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,400
Let's take the stairs.

246
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,260
Hurry up.

247
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,260
Can you hurry up?

248
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,500
Just go down from here.

249
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,550
Be careful.

250
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,700
Master.

251
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,890
Why are you back?

252
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,860
We need to hurry.

253
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,940
They are coming down soon.

254
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,340
Captain Luo, is it almost done?

255
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,420
Where did you park the car?

256
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,740
Over there, sir.

257
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:06,970
Why did you park so far?

258
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,290
We'll be there after a turn.

259
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,530
Isn't that your car?

260
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,220
Sir, I'm sorry.

261
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,320
It was parked askew.

262
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,940
Be careful.

263
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,900
Be careful.

264
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,020
Jianjun.

265
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,180
I'm leaving.

266
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,340
Thank you for your hard work.

267
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,780
Captain Luo, this guy is very vigilant.

268
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,120
To get him arrested, you must hurry up.

269
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,830
Don't worry.

270
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,260
If it's really him,

271
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,900
he won't be able to escape this time.

272
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,220
Captain Luo, we'll go back and wait for the result.

273
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,940
Please hurry up.

274
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,690
Okay, we'll do tests after going back.

275
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,520
Okay, please.

276
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,780
Thank you, Jianjun.

277
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,620
Let's go.

278
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,980
Jianjun.

279
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,450
Alright, you should also go back early.

280
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,660
Chen,

281
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,290
when you take actions,

282
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,610
can you let me join you?

283
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,540
Just for one time.

284
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,540
Chen,

285
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm experienced in dealing with such criminals.

286
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,840
Can you talk to them for me?

287
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,990
The result hasn't come out yet?

288
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,050
But it's said that

289
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,260
the result of the DNA detection

290
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,570
can come out very quickly...

291
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,060
Fine.

292
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,550
We'll wait here all the time.

293
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,260
Let us know as soon as the result comes out.

294
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,600
Okay.

295
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,820
Why hasn't the result come out yet?

296
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,580
So slow.

297
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,900
Yeah, it is.

298
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,490
But I have a feeling that

299
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,100
he won't be able to run away this time.

300
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,260
I'll go to Chief.

301
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,340
No.

302
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,670
Chief.

303
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,340
You know it clearly, right?

304
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,420
Even if you don't agree,

305
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,100
Jianjun still won't give up it, right?

306
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,490
Just grant his request once, okay?

307
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,770
Besides, every time we solve a case,

308
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,500
we all need the help of the outside personnel.

309
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,340
Right?

310
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,640
I said no.

311
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,810
It's fine if it's just a normal operation.

312
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,220
What kind of operation is this?

313
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,900
You know

314
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,460
what kind of person Jianjun is.

315
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,660
Chen Xincheng.

316
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,700
I'm warning you.

317
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,080
If you bring this up again,

318
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,200
I shall forbid you and Li Dawei

319
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,310
from participating in this operation.

320
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,180
All right, get out.

321
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,900
Okay.

322
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,680
Dawei, hurry.

323
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,060
Captain Luo.

324
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,540
From the blood stain in his car,

325
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,220
we got

326
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,220
the DNA

327
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,560
of three people in total.

328
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,770
For one of the DNA,

329
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,520
after we compared it with the DNA

330
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,340
of the last missing girl,

331
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,850
we found that they completely match.

332
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,329
It's proved that

333
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,859
this girl definitely had gotten into his car

334
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,690
and bled in his car.

335
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,300
As for the owners of the other two DNA,

336
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,230
we still need to make further investigation.

337
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,940
But I believe

338
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,980
there won't be a fourth victim.

339
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,270
Thank you, Captain Luo.

340
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,060
Haven't used it before, have you?

341
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,880
I've practiced it before.

342
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,050
This is just for self-defense.

343
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,970
We don't need it unless necessary.

344
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,740
Hello? Jianjun.

345
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,300
It's okay. Go ahead.

346
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,010
The test result?

347
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,220
It hasn't come out yet.

348
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,640
Yes, it's slow.

349
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,250
I?

350
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,380
I'm getting off work soon.

351
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,860
You should also be getting off work now, right?

352
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,070
Just go home.

353
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,460
Your child must be waiting for you.

354
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,970
Okay, let's get together some other day.

355
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,140
Okay.

356
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,340
Jianjun.

357
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,700
You heard it.

358
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,460
I've turned him down.

359
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,940
Xincheng.

360
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,700
Be careful!

361
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,740
Okay.

362
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,650
Gao Chao.

363
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,140
Can we send more people?

364
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,820
We've been applying for it

365
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,860
to Captain Luo.

366
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,890
But he said, "don't even think about it!"

367
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,970
For Chen and Dawei,

368
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,400
since they've been working for this case,

369
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,580
they're allowed to participate in it.

370
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,720
It's kinda a reward.

371
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,940
For others, just don't even think about it.

372
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,980
It's okay, Chief.

373
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,700
Be sure to take good care of them!

374
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

375
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,580
We're in the alley.

376
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,930
He's inside.

377
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,240
Act as planned.

378
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,550
Chen. Chen.

379
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,630
Jianjun? What are you doing here?

380
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,180
How did you know we had an operation today?

381
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,780
Since that day,

382
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,550
I've been waiting here every day.

383
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,230
Chen, let me join you.

384
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,160
Chen, I beg you.

385
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,260
Captain Luo.

386
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,610
Captain Luo, you can just take me as one from the joint defense.

387
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,700
Okay?

388
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,300
Enough. It's already at such a moment...

389
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,540
Jianjun is not an outsider.

390
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,250
Let him follow us.

391
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,220
Let me tell you.

392
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
He's a fugitive.

393
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,720
You don't have a weapon.

394
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,190
You can only follow and don't get close to him.

395
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,900
I know.

396
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,860
I promise.

397
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,890
Chen, go over there.

398
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,940
Jianjun.

399
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,900
Hello, Chief Zhou.

400
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,720
What is it?

401
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,820
Chen,

402
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,740
after you left last time,

403
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,120
I've been worried about it.

404
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,660
I suddenly remembered something.

405
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,280
So, I must call you right away

406
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,250
to tell you about it.

407
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,980
The car was not locked.

408
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,460
Sir, I'm sorry.

409
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,490
It was parked askew.

410
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,790
Chief Zhou, we are arresting him now.

411
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,110
I'll call you back later.

412
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,210
Let's make it short.

413
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,010
I've told you that

414
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,460
I retired early

415
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,940
because something happened in the station.

416
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,050
Police!

417
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,780
-Police! -Freeze!

418
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,500
Police!

419
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,730
A 54 pistol in the police station

420
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,590
suddenly got lost.

421
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,460
What?

422
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:42,890
Chief.

423
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,070
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

424
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,660
-Chief! Chief! -Why wouldn't you listen to me?

425
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,310
Chief, punish me!

426
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,660
-Chief! Chief! Punish me! -Why wouldn't you listen to me?

427
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,280
Punish me, Chief!

428
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,050
Chief.

429
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,060
Why wouldn't you listen to me...

430
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,380
Why?

431
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,520
Chief, punish me.

432
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,890
Let go of me!

433
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,220
Let go of me!

434
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,140
Let go of me!

435
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,110
Go inform his wife and children.

436
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,100
Tell Zhou Hui,

437

Jianjun is a hero.

438
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,020
Police enforce the law. Please stop.

439
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,300
No, no, no.

440

441

Don't go in.

447

This guy...

449

Dawei.

450

Dawei.

452
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,620

It will be held tomorrow.

these four young people

came to our Balihe police station.

Commissioned by the Bureau Party Committee,

515
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,420
I'll confer the police ranks on you today.

516
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,660
Congratulations.

517
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,050
From today onwards,

518
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,380
you'll become official members of the people's police.

519
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,130
Recently,

520
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,180
we've been talking about

521
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,660
the honor of the police.

522
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,540
Yes.

523
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,420
In the era of peace,

524
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,420
the profession as a police officer

525
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,980
has a natural sense of honor.

526
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,140
The police are the guards loyal to the Party and the people.

527
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,420
But when you officially become

529
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,950
you can't just remember the sense of honor.

530
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,970
You should also firmly keep in mind the duty and mission of the police.

531
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,300
Today,

532
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,500
when you officially become members of the people's police,

533
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,450
I have a question for you.

534
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,900
Are you ready?

535
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,060

for your whole life!

541
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,580
Even when you retire,

542
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,760
you should still bear in mind

543
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,860

544
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,980

545
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,650

546
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,580

We'll do our best.

552
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,010
Chief, there's an emergency!

553
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,770
What emergency?

554

110 [Chinese emergency call] call taker transferred the phone call here.

555
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,740

556
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,650
and got the neighboring roof of Mr. Fu's house caved in.

The two families are fighting.

559
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,620
How could a chicken leap onto the roof?

560
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,220
What kind of chicken is this?

561
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,420
Unbelievable!

562
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,180
Who's willing to go on duty?

563
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,180
I'll go.

564
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,570
Today

565
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,280
