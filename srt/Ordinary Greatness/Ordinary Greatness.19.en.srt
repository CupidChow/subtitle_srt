[Father's Responsibility]

5
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,020
In front of that person,

6
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,890
she only could swallow an insult with a flattering smile.

7
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,130
Even so, he still frequently insulted her.

8
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,210
Then why would your mom

9
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
still be with him?

10
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,979
I don't know.

11
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,590
She just cried when I asked her this question every time.

12
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,420
I guess it's because of

13
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,900
her ill health.

14
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,760
She had been out of work for a long time.

15
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,370
She doesn't have income at all.

16
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,780
How is it? Did you get into trouble?

17
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,980
Jia, don't worry.

18
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,220
That scum can't bully you anymore.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,920
No one can bully you, you know?

20
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,040
What did you do?

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,020
Why are you all wounded?

22
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,490
Ask Li Dawei.

23
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,460
We beat that man up.

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,140
I asked you two to stop Li Dawei.

25
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,420
How dare you fight with him?

26
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,579
No.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,200
He scratched my face first.

28
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,620
We really went to intervene in a fight.

29
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,570
But it was a mess.

30
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,460
Stop it.

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,880
I thought you were the calmest one.

32
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,310
Enough. What's the use of blaming them?

33
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,930
I initiated it alone.

34
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,310
It had nothing to do with them.

35
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,970
What's the use of pretending to be a hero?

36
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,650
If that person really made a scene,

37
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,960
all three of you would be involved.

38
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,860
Will this matter

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
affect me to become a regular employee?

40
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,960
Sit down.

41
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,110
Don't panic.

42
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,140
It's already like this.

43
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,500
Think about the strategies.

44
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,810
What strategy?

45
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,180
That scum did dirty things first.

46
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,460
If he dared to sue us,

47
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,300
we would expose him.

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,260
You all knew the thing?

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,450
Jia,

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,520
I didn't mean to tell them.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,820
I wanted to help you.

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,980
Jia.

53
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,940
Come on.

54
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,180
Jia.

55
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,890
Li Dawei.

56
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,030
You were too reckless this time.

57
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,480
That bastard broke the law.

58
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,220
We should let Jia

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,660
to protect herself by using legal weapons.

60
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,620
We are the police.

61
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,380
She could come to us,

62
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,459
and we will file a case for her.

63
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,300
Yes.

64
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,500
I had thought about what you said.

65
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,050
Have you ever thought

66
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,900
this guy knew

67
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,040
Jia's biological father is a police officer.

68
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,220
He still dared to do that.

69
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,350
Was he afraid that Jia would report the case to the police?

70
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,780
Yes.

71
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,140
Jia has the evidence.

72
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,630
With that video,

73
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,290
that bastard will be detained for at least five days.

74
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,060
Five days?

75
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,830
Five days?

76
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
Let the matter out.

77
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,460
Let everyone know

78
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,900
but he will be detained for only five days.

79
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,530
Do you think it can counteract

80
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,740
Jia's injury?

81
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,700
I knew it.

82
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,040
But the problem is that we are the law executors.

83
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,100
When we encountered the problems, we relied on the force instead of the law.

84
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,330
Enough.

85
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,140
Stop talking about

86
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,820
the theory.

87
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,000
I didn't do this

88
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,880
based on theory,

89
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,680
but based on the result, you know?

90
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,690
My master had a conflict with Jia originally.

91
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Jia thought my master didn't protect her well

92
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,100
and deliberately tortured my master.

93
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,520
In this situation,

94
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,159
if my master knew about this

95
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,030
and he couldn't do anything,

96
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,620
the contradiction between them would be intensified.

97
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,570
If my master decided to do something,

98
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,650
why not I couldn't do it for him?

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,770
At least let Jia know

100
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,050
her family can protect her.

101
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,620
Yes.

102
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,340
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,120
I shouldn't have told Li Dawei

104
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,230
without your permission.

105
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,530
No, sister.

106
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,810
No.

107
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,060
Thank you so much.

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,580
I didn't expect

109
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,300
Dawei and others would take the risk of being punished to beat him

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,990
for me.

111
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,710
Thank you so much.

112
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,220
Silly girl.

113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,690
We are your brothers and sister.

114
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,730
If you were bullied,

115
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,740
we would stand out and protect you

116
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,340
at all events.

117
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,740
Jia.

118
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,540
I have to apologize to you.

119
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,810
I was too impulsive.

120
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,830
If I did anything wrong...

121
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,490
No.

122
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,170
No, Dawei.

123
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,780
I should say sorry.

124
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,430
You fought because of me.

125
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,340
I'm really happy

126
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,580
to have brothers and sister like you, really.

127
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,790
Thank you so much.

128
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,460
Look at you.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,650
Why are you thanking your brother?

130
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,970
No matter what will happen in the future,

131
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,330
you remember to find me.

132
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,210
Or your sister.

133
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,140
It's the same to find these two brothers.

134
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,320
We are a family.

135
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,909
We're here.

136
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,930
No matter what difficulties you face, you don't need to be scared.

137
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,100
Don't cry.

138
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,780
Don't cry.

139
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,420
Oh no.

140
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,150
Has Officer Chen already known it?

141
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,300
Shut up!

142
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,970
Master, you're here so early.

143
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,020
Come here.

144
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,610
Go inside first.

145
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,980
What did you do this morning?

146
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,750
Nothing.

147
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,650
Nothing?

148
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,140
Do you think I don't know

149
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,059
what you have done?

150
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,860
Jia's mother told me everything.

151
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Since you knew it,

152
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,020
why did you still ask me?

153
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,940
Yes, I hit him.

154
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,260
But don't worry.

155
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,540
I'll take responsibility.

156
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,460
This is all mine.

157
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,740
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,420
You are my apprentice.

159
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,940
It's not your own business.

160
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,940
You would be responsible for what you did.

161
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,900
Let's see what you can solve.

162
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,380
Did he offend you?

163
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,980
Did you have nothing else to do?

164
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,060
Don't blame him.

165
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,940
Jia.

166
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,480
Why are you here?

167
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,420
What are you doing?

168
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,850
-Go home. -Wait. Wait a minute.

169
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,750
What's going on?

170
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,940
Since I was a child,

171
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,660
no matter what happened to me,

172
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,220
you had never protected me.

173
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,050
For now, they protected me,

174
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,210
but they have to be criticized by you.

175
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,790
What kind of father are you?

176
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,830
Jia, stop it.

177
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,260
Yes.

178
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,380
They can protect you.

179
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,720
But he beat Uncle Yu.

180
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,340
I knew it.

181
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,430
I asked them to beat him.

182
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,000
Jia.

183
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,450
Why?

184
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,580
I asked them to beat him.

185
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,260
You can blame me if you want.

186
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,540
What happened, Jia?

187
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,260
Did you know something?

188
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,820
Jia.

189
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,500
What happened?

190
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,380
Take a look by yourself.

191
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,860
Jia, what are you doing?

192
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,420
I'm drawing.

193
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,860
Was the new homework assigned by the teacher?

194
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,030
Yes.

195
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,500
I think you've improved.

196
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,780
You smell good.

197
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,860
What are you doing?

198
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,660
Don't touch me.

199
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
I would tell my mom.

200
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,750
Master! Master!

201
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,170
Calm down, master.

202
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,140
-Let go! -Master.

203
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,050
Master.

204
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,620
Dad!

205
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,900
Master, listen to me.

206
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,380
We've already...

207
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,020
Dad!

208
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,380
Let go of me!

209
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,270
We've already taught him a lesson.

210
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,380
You don't have to sacrifice yourself for him.

211
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,180
I will kill that beast.

212
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,650
Master, if you don't think for yourself,

213
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,380
you should think about it for Jia.

214
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,300
Jia's mother couldn't protect her.

215
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,580
She only has you.

216
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,210
Jia.

217
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,060
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

218
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,180
Why didn't you...

219
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,100
Dad.

220
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,200
I was incompetent.

221
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,380
I failed to protect you.

222
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,490
Dad.

223
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,660
Dad!

224
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,900
Dad.

225
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,460
Back then,

226
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,480
after I was punished,

227
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,650
I felt so down.

228
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,880
I have to bring this feeling

229
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,150
back home.

230
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,780
After a long time,

231
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,980
your mother couldn't see any hope

232
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
and wanted to divorce me.

233
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,610
Being with such a person all-day,

234
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,340
no one could stand it after a long time.

235
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,900
Though

236
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,460
I also tried my best

237
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,500
to let your mom and you live a good life,

238
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,740
I couldn't rouse myself at all.

239
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,180
So I thought

240
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,500
I'd rather let you leave

241
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,740
and live a good life

242
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,860
instead of this.

243
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,060
So I agreed.

244
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,330
When we got divorced,

245
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,900
your mother insisted on getting your custody.

246
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm a police officer.

247
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,970
I would be on standby 24 hours a day.

248
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,580
How could I have the condition to take care of you?

249
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,450
So I agreed.

250
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,050
Later,

251
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,930
when I saw the man she wanted to marry,

252
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,460
I felt regretful.

253
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,620
I wanted to get you back.

254
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,030
But your mother couldn't bear to leave you.

255
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,380
Dad,

256
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,990
let's not talk about my mom.

257
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,780
I've been living with her for all these years.

258
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,500
I know it was not easy for her.

259
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,820
Yes.

260
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,820
But Jia,

261
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,780
you are 18 years old now.

262
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,240
It's up to you who you want to live with.

263
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,640
Are you willing to?

264
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,770
Are you willing to

265
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,220
live with me?

266
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,460
Dad.

267
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm an adult now.

268
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,220
I also know something.

269
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,970
You will have your own life, won't you?

270
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,540
I do.

271
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,980
Whether you will come or not,

272
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,340
I always have my own life.

273
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,980
I...

274
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,530
Do you mean I will...

275
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,260
Well...

276
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,580
I don't know.

277
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,860
But Jia,

278
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,180
I can promise you.

279
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,380
Before you become independent

280
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,300
and find your own happiness,

281
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,860
I will be alone to

282
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,470
stay with you, okay?

283
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,410
Just the two of us.

284
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,380
How great that is!

285
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,180
Dad.

286
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,940
I do.

287
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,190
You hit me.

288
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,860
Dawei.

289
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,740
What are you doing?

290
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,900
Dawei.

291
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,210
The police hit me!

292
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,890
Calm down.

293
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,820
Calm down.

294
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,780
The police hit me!

295
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,300
You can't do anything to him no matter what he did.

296
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,340
You're breaking the rules.

297
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,100
Do you want to become a regular employee?

298
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,180
Stop fighting.

299
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,300
Actually, I don't ask for much.

300
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,420
I hope within three days

301
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,460
Li Dawei and others who beat me,

302
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,490
including Chen Xincheng would be

303
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,740
fired from the police team

304
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,300
and apologize to me face to face.

305
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,480
They would write a written undertaking that

306
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,820
they won't come near me again.

307
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,820
Otherwise,

308
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,910
I'll post these videos online.

309
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,020
The house is almost ready.

310
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,900
We can pick her up in two days.

311
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,050
Master, just for this thing,

312
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,860
you have been nagging all the way.

313
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,300
Really?

314
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,820
Be careful.

315
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,500
Slow down.

316
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,060
Are you okay?

317
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,900
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,700
It's okay.

319
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,630
I mean

320
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,140
you need to take good care of Jia.

321
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,180
If you worry about her,

322
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,250
you can just take her over.

323
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,060
I feel relieved.

324
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,700
Chen, you're back.

325
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
Chen.

326
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,250
I mean

327
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,980
thank you so much this time.

328
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,300
Fine.

329
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,020
I can't disobey my master's order.

330
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,740
How are you going to thank me?

331
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,920
How dare you!

332
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,140
Let me tell you again.

333
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,300
Once the thing gets out,

334
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,880
you just tell them that I forced you to do it.

335
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,540
Do you hear me?

336
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,020
Are you looking down on me?

337
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,660
What are you talking about?

338
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,460
I'm your master. Listen to me.

339
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,140
Do you hear me?

340
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,610
Cut the crap.

341
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,300
Chen, you're back.

342
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,900
Dawei.

343
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,380
I just came back from the dispatch.

344
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,330
I've been waiting for you.

345
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,300
I have something to tell you.

346
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,800
What is it?

347
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,210
No, it's not me.

348
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,210
The Chief is looking for you.

349
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,660
Okay.

350
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,570
You take these back

351
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,060
and check the surveillance video.

352
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,820
Let's go.

353
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,780
Chen.

354
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,940
Your ex-wife's current husband

355
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,610
was here to report a case.

356
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,260
It's the reason why the Chief wants to see you.

357
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,830
What did he say?

358
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
He said that

359
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,500
you instigated Li Dawei and the three of them

360
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,700
to beat him up

361
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,580
where he was running.

362
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,040
At that time,

363
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,660
some people who were doing morning exercises

364
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,820
and shooting the videos via their phones.

365
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,250
He collected some videos and edited them.

366
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,220
The Chief wants to talk to you first

367
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,340
and then talk to the three of them.

368
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,680
Chief Gao, I forced them to do it.

369
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,120
It had nothing to do with the three kids.

370
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,440
Brother, you forced them to hit people.

371
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,170
I don't believe you at all.

372
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,380
If you encountered this thing, you must hide as far as you can.

373
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,130
Did you force them?

374
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,780
Think about it.

375
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,770
Even if I don't believe it, will the Chief believe it?

376
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,540
What kind of person is our Chief?

377
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,690
He's like an old fox.

378
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,180
When he came in,

379
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,220
our Chief had a pretty close guess.

380
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,380
So he called us here

381
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,010
to discuss how to find out the truth

382
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,490
and how to deal with them.

383
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,570
Brother, I watched the video.

384
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,420
Though the video was edited,

385
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,860
it could tell that

386
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,940
Li Dawei beat him on impulse.

387
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,260
If you want to defend them,

388
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,700
I will advise you to think carefully.

389
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,860
Think about what?

390
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,460
If something happens, I blame it on my apprentice.

391
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,300
Am I even human?

392
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,860
Look.

393
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,380
Chief Gao,

394
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,220
I did this alone.

395
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,500
It had nothing to do with others.

396
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,100
Chief Gao,

397
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,620
you tell the Chief

398
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
for me later.

399
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,500
Then, for this matter,

400
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,940
it can be done by asking me only.

401
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,420
No. Listen to me.

402
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,900
I can help you.

403
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,340
What happened then?

404
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,580
Look at you.

405
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,580
How can I help you if you don't say it?

406
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,340
Okay, I'll go to the Chief's office first.

407
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,730
Think about it.

408
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,570
Hurry up.

409
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,260
Chief Gao.

410
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,660
Chief, Chen is here.

411
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,460
Chief.

412
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,430
Have a seat.

413
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,900
-Xincheng. -Chief Gao. Instructor.

414
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,300
Thank you.

415
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,000
Tell me. What happened?

416
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,540
It was nothing serious.

417
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,900
It's not a matter between me and that person named Yu.

418
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,700
As you know,

419
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,890
it's been years that I dislike him.

420
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,340
He took my wife away at that time.

421
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,700
It had been so many years that

422
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,660
I still couldn't get over it.

423
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,850
So

424
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,810
I forced Li Dawei to beat him up

425
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,890
to vent my anger.

426
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,140
I know I'm wrong.

427
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,380
It did make sense

428
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,830
that you forced Li Dawei.

429
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,490
Yang Shu and Zhao Jiwei were also forced by you?

430
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,470
Yes, it's all my fault.

431
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,940
I told them

432
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,180
if they wanted to become a regular employee,

433
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,980
we veteran police officers' attitude

434
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,960
can be decisive.

435
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,770
So...

436
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,820
You still remember that you're a veteran police officer?

437
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,890
I was drunk that day,

438
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,620
so I lost my mind.

439
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,260
I think you are losing your mind now.

440
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,030
You're a veteran police officer. You don't understand?

441
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,050
You want to protect them

442
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,730
and take all the responsibilities.

443
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,980
You said you forced

444
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,530
and instigated them.

445
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,250
You were the mastermind.

446
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,700
What is this?

447
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,140
This is a premeditated crime.

448
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,060
Not only can't protect them,

449
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,980
but also you get yourself involved.

450
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,210
And this is what he wants.

451
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,290
It's up to him.

452
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,060
I'll accept the punishment.

453
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,540
Is the police station yours

454
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,730
or mine?

455
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,610
I can do whatever you say?

456
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,150
You're a veteran cop.

457
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,220
Why don't you have the awareness at all?

458
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,810
Yes.

459
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,940
I have low awareness.

460
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,540
But this happened because of me.

461
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,660
We don't have to implicate those kids.

462
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,340
Listen.

463
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,490
Listen.

464
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,790
Are you teaching me how to become a Chief?

465
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,690
No, Chief.

466
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,300
Actually, this matter was

467
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,940
a personal grudge between Yu and Chen.

468
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,980
If we expand the scope,

469
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,700
we can't solve the fundamental problem.

470
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,660
Nonsense.

471
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,780
That man wants to drag Xincheng

472
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,060
to make things big.

473
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,140
Even if he makes a scene,

474
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,490
I'll just accept the punishment.

475
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,260
I admit it.

476
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,450
Chen, don't worry.

477
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,620
Calm down.

478
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,660
Sit down.

479
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,660
Are you arguing with me?

480
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,950
Calm down.

481
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,060
Chen, listen to me.

482
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,980
How our police station deals with this thing

483
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,490
is our police station's business.

484
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,380
But if you want to protect them,

485
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,810
you should have your principles.

486
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,220
Now,

487
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,660
the most important thing is that

488
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,010
we need to figure it out.

489
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,660
Instructor, what else didn't we know?

490
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,950
Chief Gao has understood it, right?

491
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,020
I have personal grudges with Yu, right?

492
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,410
I'll bear the consequences.

493
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,640
Chen, it's not that simple.

494
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,490
Xincheng.

495
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,560
You're always so quiet at ordinary times.

496
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,780
You are a blockhead.

497
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,260
You are so stubborn at a critical moment.

498
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,740
If you had apologized back then,

499
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,580
would you accept the punishment?

500
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,820
Chief, you have to make it clear.

501
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,260
What did I do wrong at that time?

502
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,300
Why should I admit the fault?

503
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,940
Chen.

504
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,780
Then why did you admit the fault today?

505
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,180
Then why did I admit the fault today?

506
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,100
Calm down.

507
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,420
Calm down.

508
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,290
Stop talking, Chen.

509
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,130
Stop arguing.

510
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,060
Calm down, okay?

511
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,740
For this matter,

512
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,540
I suggest

513
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,100
it's not necessary to expand the scope.

514
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Of course, you decide

515
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,220
what to do.

516
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,540
We haven't finished yet.

517
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,060
Where are you going?

518
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,880
No, Chief.

519
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,420
since it's personal grudge,

520
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,020
how about this?

521
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,010
I call Yu over

522
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,900
and let him sit with Chen,

523
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,500
and finish the conversation face to face.

524
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,540
That's all.

525
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,820
Explain what?

526
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,260
Our police station's policeman beat him up.

527
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,090
We pretended not to know.

528
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,620
Chief, you always

529
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,980
teach us leaders at ordinary times.

530
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,900
Let us play dumb when it's time.

531
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,500
Right?

532
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,020
When did I ask you to play dumb?

533
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,100
Fine, forget what I said.

534
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,790
What are you doing?

535
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,140
Chief Cheng.

536
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,320
Master, what's up?

537
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,340
Come with me.

538
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,780
Jie.

539
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,340
Did you participate in Li Dawei's beating?

540
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,860
You all know it.

541
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,810
So you were involved?

542
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,250
I wasn't involved in the fight, but...

543
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,100
But what?

544
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,450
It has something to do with me too.

545
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,060
It has something to do with you?

546
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,650
What?

547
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,180
Master, this...

548
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,680
This involved Jia.

549
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,700
I can't tell you.

550
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,660
Jia.

551
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,060
Chen Xincheng's daughter.

552
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,100
How about this?

553
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,220
You don't have to tell me.

554
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,800
But, Jie,

555
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,260
the situation is complicated now.

556
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,380
The police may take Li Dawei seriously.

557
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,130
Although Chen Xincheng wants to take all the responsibilities,

558
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,620
he can't bear it as he wants.

559
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,650
Master,

560
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,070
Li Dawei has his reason.

561
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,260
Can you go to say something to the Chief

562
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,620
for him and his master?

563
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,300
I'll try my best.

564
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,810
Thank you, master.

565
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,180
Jie.

566
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,780
Remember, don't get involved.

567
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,780
It's so important.

568
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,700
Chief.

569
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,620
You haven't finished yet?

570
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,740
Chief, come out.

571
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,290
I have something to tell you.

572
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,420
Chief, can't you see it?

573
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,810
What do you mean?

574
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,100
Think about it.

575
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,420
If that person really had solid evidence,

576
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,890
would he just ask for an apology?

577
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,360
That means

578
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,970
he has something

579
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,700
is in Chen's hands.

580
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,870
He doesn't want to expand this matter's influence.

581
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,500
So,

582
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,260
I think we should tell him

583
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,260
we have criticized Chen and the others.

584
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,100
This matter will probably be over.

585
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,060
It's obvious there.

586
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,490
I can tell.

587
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,660
The problem is to

588
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,420
figure out

589
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,700
what happened, right?

590
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,180
Yes.

591
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,290
We make decisions based on deduction,

592
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,380
don't we?

593
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,820
We have to figure it out overall.

594
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,660
Yes.

595
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,130
If we didn't know anything about it,

596
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,790
we would be passive.

597
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,700
Yes.

598
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,170
Let's go on.

599
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,580
I heard from my master that

600
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,220
your master took all the responsibilities.

601
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,860
My master didn't know about it originally.

602
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,300
I'll talk to the Chief.

603
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,290
Don't panic.

604
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,820
What are you going to say?

605
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,330
I'll take responsibility.

606
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,500
I did it all.

607
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,740
The video was recorded.

608
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,900
All three of you were there.

609
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,900
No one would believe you,

610
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,740
even if you said it was done by you.

611
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,580
The four of us were all involved in this.

612
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,690
No one could escape.

613
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,140
No, no.

614
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,140
Yang Shu is a potential candidate for the bureau.

615
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,050
We can't let this affect his future.

616
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,240
Not to mention Zhao Jiwei.

617
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,030
He values the police status more than everything.

618
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,050
Besides, Yang Shu and Zhao Jiwei

619
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,920
went to intervene in a fight.

620
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,240
The video should be recorded clearly.

621
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,220
I can explain it clearly.

622
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,220
I'll turn myself in.

623
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,110
Wait.

624
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:07,980
Li Dawei.

625
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,770
Wait.

626
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,740
Chief.

627
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,180
What are you doing here?

628
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,730
I told you to watch the surveillance video.

629
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,780
Hurry up, people are waiting.

630
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,530
Xia Jie, why are you here?

631
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,570
Didn't I tell you to check

632
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,340
the security situation in Mao Yuan Building?

633
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,100
Hurry up.

634
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,620
Master.

635
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,260
Chief.

636
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,300
The fight was due to my impulsiveness.

637
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,220
Yang Shu and Zhao Ji Wei went to stop the fight.

638
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,580
My master knew nothing.

639
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,700
It's all my fault.

640
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,460
Didn't you hear me?

641
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,260
And me.

642
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,500
I provoked Dawei

643
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,700
and caused him to be impulsive.

644
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,780
Xia Jie, what are you talking about?

645
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,380
Chief, don't listen to her.

646
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,620
It's all my fault.

647
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,260
You're loyal.

648
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,500
What do you think the police force is?

649
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,820
Brothers?

650
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,460
Jie, were you involved in a fight?

651
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,570
If not, stop yelling.

652
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,460
Get out first.

653
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,140
I asked Yang Shu and Zhao Jiwei to go.

654
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,870
So I was also involved.

655
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,900
Xia Jie, shut up!

656
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,980
It's you again.

657
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,340
Yes, it's me again.

658
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Chief, the matter

659
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,210
was my own business from the beginning to the end.

660
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,490
Not only did Xia Jie not participate,

661
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,570
but also stopped me.

662
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,180
Yang Shu and Zhao Jiwei were the same.

663
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,900
You can punish me alone if you want.

664
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,540
Nonsense!

665
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,610
Don't listen to him, Chief.

666
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,420
Master, what did it have to do with you?

667
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,530
You knew nothing.

668
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,220
If you hadn't taught me,

669
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,600
I might have killed him by mistake.

670
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,380
Stop it.

671
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,250
You're really something.

672
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,540
Gao Chao.

673
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,380
Find a place to make him reflect on himself.

674
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,420
Don't come out without my order.

675
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,100
Let's go.

676
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,540
Chief.

677
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,660
Hold on.

678
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,380
Xincheng?

679
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,540
You are his master.

680
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,980
What you should do is

681
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,220
train him to be

682
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,450
a qualified police officer.

683
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,650
You should not cover up for him

684
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,900
when he did something wrong.

685
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,260
Yes, Chief.

686
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,850
You are the leader.

687
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,100
You have your attitude.

688
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,350
But Li Dawei beat people because of me.

689
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,380
You can punish me if you want.

690
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,830
You...

691
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,500
Whoever touches my apprentice today

692
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,260
will be my enemy.

693
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,190
Master.

694
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,420
Fine, I'll be your enemy.

695
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,770
You're a police officer.

696
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,690
How could you say that?

697
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,290
Gao Chao, take him away.

698
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,220
Who dares to move?

699
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,060
No, brother.

700
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,490
Move.

701
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,080
Do you all want to know

702
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,700
why Li Dawei beat people?

703
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,010
Okay, I'll tell you.

704
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,340
It was supposed to be done by me who was acting

705
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,170
as a father.

706
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,659
But I am not capable.

707
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,090
I'm a loser.

708
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,659
I can't protect my daughter.

709
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,090
It's easy for Li Dawei to beat him.

710
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,929
If someone dares to imprison my apprentice today,

711
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,699
I'll kill Yu tomorrow.

712
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,620
Do you believe it?

713
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,860
Enough, Chen.

714
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,860
Just tell the Chief

715
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,340
the matter clearly.

716
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,780
Fine.

717
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Yu...

718
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,100
He...

719
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,300
He...

720
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,220
He insulted Jia.

721
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,780
She is only a teenager.

722
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,800
She's just a kid. Who can she tell?

723
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,830
Can she tell her mother?

724
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,620
Or tell me?

725
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,560
I couldn't protect her.

726
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,380
Li Dawei saved her

727
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,980
and went to argue with Yu.

728
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,980
That was why they were involved.

729
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
Without me who is a good-for-nothing master,

730
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,220
he wouldn't have made the mistake.

731
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,090
Master, stop it.

732
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,020
I didn't handle it well.

733
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,100
and caused you trouble.

734
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,100
Cut the crap.

735
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,450
This is between us, you know?

736
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,420
Chief,

737
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,260
I understand Brother Chen.

738
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,820
I have a daughter too.

739
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,330
If someone dares to hurt my daughter,

740
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,560
I'll fight him too.

741
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,730
You all leave first.

742
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,650
Chief.

743
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,100
I told you to leave.

744
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,620
Chief.

745
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,410
Didn't you hear me?

746
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,940
Let's go.

747
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,570
Get out first.

748
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,300
Master, what's wrong?

749
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,050
My anti-fraud publicity has just one end left.

750
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,090
What's the rush?

751
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,070
I heard that you and Zhao Jiwei

752
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,050
beat Chen Xincheng's ex-wife's current husband.

753
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,100
Was that true?

754
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,900
Who told you that?

755
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,550
Do you still have time to ask about this?

756
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,500
They raised the roof

757
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,880
in the Chief's office.

758
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,980
Our police station is working on how to deal with it.

759
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,060
Master, it's true.

760
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,020
I was also involved.

761
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,570
Are you crazy, Yang Shu?

762
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,210
Why did you get involved with them?

763
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,010
I did go to intervene in the fight at first,

764
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,260
but that person deserved it.

765
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,980
It was not up to you.

766
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,130
Are you the same as Li Dawei?

767
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,470
When he came,

768
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,220
he came as a partner.

769
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,900
And you?

770
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,690
You're here to exercise.

771
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,180
You're going to the bureau one year later.

772
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,850
Look at you.

773
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,240
Why did you quarrel with them?

774
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,670
Master, you don't know the situation.

775
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,020
If you were here,

776
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,250
you wouldn't have tolerated it.

777
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,490
Alright, I don't want to hear this.

778
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,380
You look smart.

779
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,490
You can't distinguish the pros and cons at a crucial moment.

780
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,670
There's one thing so clear.

781
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,540
Remember.

782
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,240
Li Dawei went to beat him,

783
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,220
but you went to intervene in the fight.

784
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,210
That's the truth.

785
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,980
So Li Dawei will be responsible

786
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,100
for which should be taken by Li Dawei.

787
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,580
Don't...

788
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,630
Let me finish.

789
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,220
Li Dawei will go...

790
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,900
Officer Chen.

791
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,620
Li Dawei.

792
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,860
Chen.

793
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,300
Don't stare at me like that.

794
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,930
I just want Yang Shu to have a clear mind.

795
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,540
Isn't that right?

796
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,170
Master.

797
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,080
Li Dawei.

798
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,790
Stand still.

799
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,890
Chief Cheng.

800
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,960
Chief Cheng, I didn't say anything.

801
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,130
Based on the truth, I just want Yang Shu

802
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,540
to stay out of it.

803
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,780
The responsibility should be taken by the one who should take the responsibility.

804
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,700
You see

805
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,580
the expression in Brother Chen's eyes

806
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,660
was like he would eat me.

807
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,980
Get back to work.

808
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,140
Jianjun,

809
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,570
aren't you on duty tonight?

810
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:29,690
Let's hang out together.

811
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,660
Okay.

812
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,060
I know.

813
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,300
Don't take my bag. Don't take it.

814
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,580
I'm telling you for the last time.

815
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,220
Will you accept it or not?

816
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,780
I won't do it again.

817
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,500
No, take it away.

818
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,510
No, no, no.

819
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,570
Take them all away.

820
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,260
Don't take them away.

821
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,140
Take them all away.

822
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,780
Don't take them away.

823
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,900
Officer Zhang.

824
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,020
Officer Zhang is here.

825
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,140
Okay.

826
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,100
Stop it.

827
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,980
I knew it.

828
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,620
Step back.

829
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,900
No. Step back first.

830
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,730
Step back.

831
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,740
Tell me, what happened?

832
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,420
Officer Zhang.

833
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,780
It's not easy for everyone to set up a stall here.

834
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,740
Look, they took our stuffs.

835
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,500
Yes, I know.

836
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,210
Zhang, you know

837
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,020
they can't set up a stall here.

838
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,860
We've posted the notice and done our work.

839
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,940
I tried to persuade them several times,

840
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,090
but they didn't listen to me.

841
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,700
Okay, I know.

842
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,140
Okay. Come on.

843
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,050
Let me tell you.

844
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,400
You don't know much about this place.

845
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,630
They are all residents here.

846
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,370
Many people have to rely on this stall to make a living.

847
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,470
How about this?

848
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,610
Do me a favor.

849
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,950
Don't confiscate their stuffs, okay?

850
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
Give them back first.

851
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,020
I'll help you solve this problem later.

852
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:50,780
Okay?

853
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,730
This...

854
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,240
Okay.

855
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,170
Give the stuffs to them.

856
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,510
Okay. Come on.

857
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,740
Thank you, Officer Zhang.

858
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,290
Move things.

859
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,230
Don't do it again.

860
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,860
Thank you, Officer Zhang.

861
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,780
Thank you.

862
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
This is mine.

863
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,300
Zhang, we did it for your sake.

864
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,540
You promised to help us.

865
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
I trust you too.

866
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,340
But if they set up the stall along the whole street next time,

867
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,100
we'll be doomed.

868
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,260
I know. I know.

869
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,840
Don't worry. I promise I'll solve it for you.

870
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,340
Okay?

871
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,340
Okay. Thank you.

872
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,980
Okay.

873
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,100
Thank you for your cooperation.

874
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,060
Guys, let's go.

875
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,820
Let's go.

876
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,380
Thank you, Officer Zhao.

877
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,220
You're welcome.

878
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,180
Thank you.

879
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,540
Okay.

880
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,460
Take care. Thank you for your cooperation.

881
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,820
Alright, everyone.

882
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,660
Come here.

883
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,220
Listen to me.

884
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,740
Come here. Listen to me.

885
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,660
We can't set up a stall here.

886
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,680
This is clearly stated, you know?

887
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,580
Yes.

888
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:57,980
Give me some time.

889
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,460
I'll talk to the community

890
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,940
to see if we can solve this problem from the root,

891
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,740
okay?

892
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,740
Okay, thank you.

893
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,690
Officer, please help us.

894
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,300
Okay?

895
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,700
Please cooperate, okay?

896
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,820
Okay, I understand.

897
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,660
I'm counting on you.

898
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,100
Please cooperate and listen to my news.

899
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,230
Let's go.

900
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,900
Master.

901
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,100
Most of these residents

902
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,340
are transferred from the countryside.

903
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,460
They need to make a living

904
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,330
to support their families.

905
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,900
They are not allowed to do it here.

906
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,420
We have to find a way

907
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,700
to find a place for them to set up the stall.

908
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,060
Jiwei, that's right.

909
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,440
You're finally worried about the people.

910
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,300
I've been worried.

911
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,930
Besides, I'm just a civilian.

912
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,260
Hello?

913
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:43,970
Chief Cheng.

914
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,290
Yes.

915
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,630
You eat first. Don't wait for me.

916
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,820
Okay, I'll be right there.

917
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,100
Okay.

918
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,900
What's wrong, master?

919
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,090
Jiwei, tell me the truth.

920
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,060
For you, Li Dawei and Yang Shu,

921
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,170
what happened about you beating people?
