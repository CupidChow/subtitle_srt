5
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,970
It was us who responded to the call.

[Chief Office]

7
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,229
At that time Master and I were on our way back to the station.

8
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,710
It was 10:42 when we responded to the call.

9
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,650
We arrived at the scene at around 11.

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,479
The caller said she had a fight with her husband.

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,759
And her husband left home.

12
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,090
His phone was off and she couldn't find him.

13
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,640
But she also speculated that

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,650
her husband might have

15
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,690
gone to their villa,

16
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,039
so she asked us to go to villa.

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,759
And she said when we got there,

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
we only needed to ensure that

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,570
her husband's car was parked in the yard.

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,640
And we didn't have to knock

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,120
or call him.

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,730
She didn't want us to disturb her husband's rest.

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,720
That was recorded on the report.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,490
She also signed it.

25
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,280

27
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,180
Yang Shu handled this case.

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,240
I just wanted to train him.

29
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,730
What's wrong?

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,680
Her husband committed suicide and was found dead in the car

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,170
this morning.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,170
Why didn't you

33
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,050
check the car?

34
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,850
Right. Yang Shu.

35
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,040
I was answering a phone call.

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,079
Why didn't you check the car?

37
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,810
No. Master...

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,160
Master, what do you mean?

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,329
We were together at that time.

40
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,920
The car was parked in the yard.

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,520
The gate was locked.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,490
How could I get in?

43
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,360
Right. There is a yard in their villa.

44
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,530
The gate was locked.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
She didn't want us to knock.

46
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,720
We couldn't climb the gate, right?

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,730
We couldn't.

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,080
All right, it's quite clear.

49
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,530
She signed it.

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
That's not our responsibility.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,590
But you two should

52
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,890
be mentally prepared.

53
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,280
This woman insists that

54
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,370
that her husband died

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
because of the police's negligence.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,800
You two

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,720
don't need to see her.

58
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm going to meet her

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,180
with the signed report.

60
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,920
Chief, I'm not afraid...

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,760
I'm not afraid to see her.

62
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,480
I confirmed it with Master.

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,840
And when we got there, I called her to confirm it.

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,920
We have recordings.

65
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,579
All right.

66
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,700
Just listen to Chief.

67
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,770
Don't act on your own.

68
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,360
Master, are you afraid of taking responsibility?

69
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,890
Fine. Since you said I did everything,

70
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,880
I'll go with you, Chief.

71
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,130
OK. You come with me.

72
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,830
Yang Shu.

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Don't be emotional.

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,170
Her husband committed suicide

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,920
because he had a fight with her

76
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,540
and couldn't get over with it.

77
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,399
She just wants to find a scapegoat now.

78
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,149
You know?

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,519
Don't take it personal.

80
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,970
Chief, I'm not mad at the woman.

81
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,360
I'm mad at my Master.

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,220
Our internal affairs should be dealt with internally.

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
Don't show it

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,930
in front of the public.

85
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,850
Chief, I know what I should do for the big picture.

86
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:40,990
Let's go.

87
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,400
Hello, Ms. Ma.

88
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,290
I'm Wang Shouyi.

89
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,290
Let's have a talk.

90
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,890
OK.

91
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,120
Master.

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,040
Thank you

93
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,310
for what you did yesterday.

94
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,880
I dare not to accept it.

95
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,760
Are you still mad at me?

96
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,850
I dare not.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,880
And

98
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm not your Master yet.

99
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,680
Master, I have my reason.

100
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,730
How about I tell you about it?

101
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,330
No.

102
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,450
I'm also having a hard time.

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,960
If you want to talk about it,

104
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,120
go upstairs and talk to Chief.

105
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
I've made it clear to Chief.

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,490
Fine.

107
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,970
I'll say something more then.

108
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,200
It's not easy for your parents to raise you.

109
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,159
Right?

110
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,080
Even if they do something wrong,

111
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,420
they will always be your parents

112
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,730
wherever they are.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,520
Yes.

114
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,170
Master.

115
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,650
You are the same.

116
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,050
You are my Master wherever you go.

117
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,700
All right.

118
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,650
Such good words

119
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,000
that came out of your mouth

120
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,630
made me get goose bumps.

121
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,930
Master,

122
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
I really feel from the bottom of my heart that

123
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,830
I made a mistake.

124
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,960
It is because

125
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,540
I don't have enough ideological

126
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,840
and political awareness,

127
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,370
and I forgot my responsibility as a police officer.

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,520
Are you going to

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,600
write a self-criticism letter with 3,000 words?

130
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,340
No.

131
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,670
What's the point of writing so many reports?

132
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,770
I mean, Master, you can torture me.

133
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,550
You can torment me.

134
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,700
You can hit me with a bunch of cases.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm ready

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,450
to raise my spirit awareness.

137
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,570
OK.

138
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Then you should

139
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,880
deal with

140
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,220
all these files.

141
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,180
I just said it.

142
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,440
I called the police.

143
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,180
And he went to the villa.

144
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,780
Why didn't you go in and have a look?

145
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,410
Now my husband is dead.

146
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,690
What should I do?

147
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,330
Ms. Ma.

148
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Look.

149
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,680
This is a police report.

150
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,560
There is your signature on it.

151
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,450
You asked our police officers

152
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,930
to check in front of the villa to see

153
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,320
if your husband's car was there.

154
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,130
And you said that if the care was there,

155
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,120
they shouldn't knock or call

156
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,840
so as not to disturb his rest.

157
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,080
According to your requirements,

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,440
we all did what you asked.

159
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,050
Yang Shu,

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,520
didn't you call Ms. Ma

161
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,090
at the gate of the villa?

162
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,530
Is there a recording of the phone call?

163
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,610
There are recordings.

164
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,960
I have both the audio and the video recordings.

165
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,220
This is your villa.

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,370
The gate was locked.

167
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,870
We could only stay outside. We couldn't get in.

168
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,730
We saw

169
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,690
your car parked in the yard.

170
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,370
Look.

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,610
And

172
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,120
this is the audio recording of our phone call.

173
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,680
Listen.

174
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,560
Hello?

175
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
Hello, Ms. Ma.

176
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,720
This is Baili River Police.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,560
We're at the villa you mentioned.

178
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,190
Your husband's car is parked in the yard.

179
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,520
Should we go in

180
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,240
or call him?

181
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,400
His car is parked in the yard?

182
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,900
Did you confirm that it was his car?

183
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,169
Yes, Ping E58080.

184
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,250
That's good.

185
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,690
No, don't call him.

186
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,010
Don't disturb him.

187
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,930
Thank you.

188
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,150
Then let me check again.

189
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,290
We just need to see the car parked in the yard.

190
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,320
We don't have to go in

191
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,930
or call him, right?

192
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,680
Yes.

193
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,490
OK, bye.

194
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,000
But...

195
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
But he didn't die in the villa.

196
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,170
He died in the car.

197
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,050
The car was still on.

198
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,050
It made a sound.

199
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,850
Couldn't you hear it?

200
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,600
Why didn't you check the car?

201
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,590
Ms. Ma.

202
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,730
We really didn't hear that

203
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,800
the car wasn't turn off.

204
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,360
The gate is a bit away from the car.

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,750
And our car was still on.

206
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,940
We really didn't hear it.

207
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,880
If we did,

208
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,360
how could we just let him die?

209
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,170
You just let him die.

210
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,450
Would my husband have died

211
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,130
if you had checked the car?

212
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,320
My goodness.

213
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,140
He was a living man.

214
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,930
But he just died all of a sudden.

215
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,350
What should I do in the future?

216
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,880
How can I live?

217
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,010
Ms. Ma.

218
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,180
Calm down.

219
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,530
Ms. Ma.

220
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,510
Control your emotions.

221
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,710
We sympathize with

222
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,490
your family's misfortune.

223
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,280
But our police officers did nothing wrong

224
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,720
with this case.

225
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,440
What do you mean?

226
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,410
I called the police because I knew well about my husband

227
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,110
and I was afraid something would happen to him.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,920
But what about you?

229
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,920
You didn't take it seriously.

230
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,530
You don't care about the lives of the people.

231
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,810
You are irresponsible.

232
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,080
If he had gone in to have a look,

233
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,270
would my husband have died?

234
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
Ms. Ma.

235
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,580
If you say that, it's unreasonable.

236
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,690
What do you mean?

237
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,560
Is it because

238
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,400
you are his Chief that

239
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,490
you just want to protect him?

240
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,650
Why are you so unreasonable?

241
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,600
Fine. Since you are unreasonable,

242
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
I'll report to another place!

243
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,260
Ms. Ma!

244
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,670
Ms. Ma!

245
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,160
Someone just died.

246
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,450
It's hard for her to control her emotions.

247
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Yang Shu.

248
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,810
Where is your Master?

249
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,200
I didn't see him.

250
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,920
It seems that

251
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,280
she won't let it go.

252
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,960
Maybe she'll call the tip line 12345.

253
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Or

254
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,270
she will report to the bureau.

255
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,440
What is inevitable can not be stopped.

256
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,200
We police officers handled it legally.

257
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,310
We did nothing wrong.

258
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,820
If she wants to make a scene,

259
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,420
let her do it.

260
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,240
Chief Wang. Instructor Ye.

261
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,570
Yang Shu.

262
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
Show me the report of yesterday's case.

263
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,580
Jianjun.

264
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,520
The bureau sent inspectors

265
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,710
to find out about Ms. Ma's complaint.

266
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,290
Go in and report the situation.

267
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,390
Yang Shu handled it.

268
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,080
Let him...

269
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,440
Who is the Master?

270
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,920
You are the Master. You should go.

271
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,120
Your husband's car is parked in the yard.

272
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,480
Should we go in

273
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,210
or call him?

274
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,970
His car is parked in the yard.

275
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,710
Yes, Ping E58080.

276
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,160
No, don't call him.

277
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,440
Don't disturb him.

278
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,920
We just need to see the car parked in the yard.

279
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,950
We don't have to go in

280
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,580
or call him, right?

281
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,300
Yes.

282
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,530
OK, bye.

283
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,520
I see.

284
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,240
Your materials are complete.

285
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,830
From the evidence,

286
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,400
there's nothing wrong with your handling.

287
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,120
Of course,

288
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,090
it would have been better

289
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,840
to check the car.

290
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,220
Comrade,

291
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,870
it's pretty easy to be wise

292
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,830
after the event.

293
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,330
The caller

294
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,040
clearly asked our police

295
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,930
not to disturb her husband's rest.

296
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,410
How could our police realize that

297
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,120
he was not in the villa

298
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,030
but in the car?

299
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,240
Fine.

300
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,230
We initially believe

301
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,400
there's nothing wrong with your handling.

302
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,960
We'll go back to the bureau and report immediately.

303
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,060
It should be fine.

304
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,700
OK, thank you.

305
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,390
We'll go back now.

306
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:56,930
OK.

307
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,730
Yang Shu.

308
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,850
It's OK. Don't worry.

309
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,780
It's my all fault even if it's not fine.

310
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,400
It has nothing to do with you.

311
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,050
There's no one here.

312
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,810
Come and take seats.

313
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,560
Let's go over there.

314
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,850
Has your problem been solved?

315
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,890
The leader scolded me.

316
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,270
I wrote 3,000 words of self-criticism.

317
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,420
Now we're waiting for the decision from the bureau.

318
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,240
Li Dawei,

319
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,680
I really admire your attitude.

320
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,680
I told you

321
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,960
I've been practicing since I was a kid.

322
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,640
My elementary school teacher said

323
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,710
this is another aspect of I being unreliable

324
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,270
which is being forgetful.

325
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,200
Just one word for you. Awesome.

326
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,330
By the way,

327
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,190
Xia Jie has moved to my place.

328
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,380
You should move in as soon as possible.

329
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,760
If you need any help,

330
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,720
just let me know.

331
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,290
Thank you.

332
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,850
Why are you thanking me?

333
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,280
I have to thank you for this.

334
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,290
For what?

335
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,160
As long as the thing is over, it will be just fine.

336
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,359
It's not that easy.

337
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,200
Do you know what my Master asked me to do?

338
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,630
He asked me to handle such a high pile of files.

339
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm telling you that he's trying to trick me.

340
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,790
Master.

341
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,060
Officer Chen.

342
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,369
What's wrong?

343
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,850
You don't have a good appetite? Why are you eating so little?

344
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,010
Your wolfberry tea is not made well enough today.

345
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,330
Have you finished

346
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,330
all the files?

347
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,280
I have more.

348
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,240
Good.

349
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,810
You don't pull a long face today.

350
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,020
I was talking about him.

351
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,300
Facing the achievements we made in the last quarter,

352
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,960
all the police are confident

353
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,170
to develop the glory and tradition of Bali River Police Station

354
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,690
and strive for greater glory.

355
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,880
The ending is so powerful.

356
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,880
No wonder it's written by a PhD graduate.

357
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,000
And

358
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,610
the advanced individuals of last quarter

359
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,560
have been selected.

360
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,730
Ye Wei, read it.

361
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,370
Balihe Police Community Officer, Zhang Zhijie.

362
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,890
Balihe Police Station Officer, Yuan Shiqi.

363
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,580
Balihe Police Station Officer, Jiang Zhigang.

364
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,880
Balihe Police Station Cadet, Xia Jie.

365
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,750
Balihe Auxiliary Police Officer, Sun Qiancheng.

366
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,050
Congratulations, comrades.

367
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,640
I hope all of you

368
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
can keep up the good work

369
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,570
and make good results, OK?

370
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,650
Congratulations.

371
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,990
Chief, Instructor,

372
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
I did nothing last quarter,

373
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
but Jianjun and his disciple saved a person.

374
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,160
I...

375
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,370
And

376
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,650
we have four

377
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,960
new comrades.

378
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,430
They performed

379
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,770
very well.

380
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,370
But

381
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,310
some comrades need to be improved.

382
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,880
You should learn how to change from a student

383
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,810
to a qualified police officer.

384
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,720
You need this change.

385
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,600
That's all for today's meeting.

386
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
Go back to your work.

387
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,950
Let's go.

388
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,050
Qizi.

389
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,100
You two come here.

390
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,090
What are you waiting for? Get to work.

391
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,030
Master.

392
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,650
What's wrong?

393
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Come in.

394
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,760
Come in.

395
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,430
Instructor.

396
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,420
Jianjun, what's the matter?

397
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,760
Why are you so serious?

398
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,690
OK, take a seat.

399
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,880
It's OK. I'll just stand here.

400
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,490
What's wrong?

401
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,410
Officer Xia,

402
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,240
can you bring some words in for me?

403
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,890
What?

404
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,030
My child suffers from asthma.

405
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,970
She needs medicine.

406
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,010
Can you ask me where the medicine is?

407
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,590
Officer Xia,

408
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,050
I beg you.

409
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,250
I have no choice.

410
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,440
I am a failure.

411
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,230
All her life is

412
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,780
for the child.

413
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,480
Only if she knows the child is good now,

414
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,010
she can be at ease

415
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,650
to receive education

416
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,630
and reform inside there.

417
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,530
And this is life-saving medicine.

418
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,120
If the child has an asthma attack

419
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,290
without medicine,

420
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,580
what should I do about it?

421
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,920
Fine.

422
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Did you ask?

423
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,810
I was about to ask.

424
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,010
Xu told me

425
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,930
the female suspect was the main culprit.

426
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,570
It's OK.

427
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm sorry, Master.

428
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
I was too naive.

429
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,120
I just felt sorry for her.

430
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,250
She's such a woman with a child.

431
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,730
I didn't expect...

432
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,080
Jie.

433
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
You are a girl

434
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,880
with compassion.

435
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,160
That's normal.

436
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,860
And it has been not long since you became a policewoman.

437
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,990
You have no experience in dealing with suspects.

438
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,180
It's inevitable to be deceived.

439
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,450
Don't take it seriously.

440
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,610
Should I tell Chief

441
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,600
to make a self-criticism?

442
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,230
No need.

443
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,880
Don't feel pressured.

444
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,450
Go back to work.

445
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,440
It's your mom's call. Pick it up.

446
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,290
She must be congratulating you for being selected

447
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,200
as an advanced individual shortly after you came to work.

448
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,800
Pick it up and make her happy.

449
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,610
Master.

450
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,740
What should I do

451
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,730
if her husband contacts with me again?

452
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,370
He's not her husband.

453
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,170
And he won't contact with you anymore.

454
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,280
Take a seat.

455
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,020
Come on.

456
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,460
Take a seat.

457
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,520
Let me tell you about it.

458
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,550
Here.

459
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,510
That man is her partner.

460
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,860
They opened this

461
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,560
foot therapy shop together

462
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,490
which was actually a prostitution center.

463
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,360
We caught the man.

464
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,720
He told us everything.

465
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,120
The woman was the owner of this shop.

466
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,960
She hired the girls

467
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,120
who just entered the city

468
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,870
in the name of recruiting waitresses.

469
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,020
Once they went in,

470
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,500
they would seize their ID cards

471
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,540
and beat or rape them to

472
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,440
restrict their personal freedom

473
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,780
and destroy their pride,

474
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,350
so that they could force them to prostitute.

475
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,230
The so-called asthma pills

476
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,300
were actually obscene videos recorded

477
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,670
when these girls were forced

478
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,560
by them.

479
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,440
They used the videos to threaten the girls to prostitute.

480
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,610
The man asked you to ask her about it.

481
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,590
Actually he was asking

482
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,210
where those obscene videos are hidden,

483
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,290
so that he could use them to threaten other girls

484
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,150
and continue his prostitution business.

485
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,940
Jie.

486
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,260
Don't blame yourself.

487
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,900
Everyone has a beginning.

488
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,080
I was even more confused when I first started.

489
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,910
I remember...

490
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,310
The door is open. Stop knocking.

491
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,100
Jianjun talked to you?

492
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,320
He didn't get selected.

493
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,690
He complained a bit to me.

494
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,220
Why would he complain?

495
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
I think it's his old problem again.

496
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,170
It's fine that he likes to show off.

497
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,510
But now that something bad happened,

498
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,890
he blamed it on his disciple.

499
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,650
You know his secret trouble.

500
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,520
His brother-in-law is always better than him.

501
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,880
He can't stand up straight in front of his father-in-law.

502
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,680
The problem is not in Jianjun

503
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,420
but his mother-in-law.

504
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,310
She compared these two sons-in-law every day.

505
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,010
The rich one is like a beautiful flower.

506
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,460
The poor one is like stinky tofu residue.

507
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,920
Jianjun wants to stand up,

508
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,320
so he must approach good things

509
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,530
and hide away from bad things.

510
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,220
What do you want him to do?

511
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,770
Are you persuading me

512
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,320
or him?

513
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,880
Is this his mother-in-law's problem?

514
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,060
Does he have no judgment?

515
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,540
In my opinion,

516
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,030
this is his personality.

517
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,000
Work is not for fame,

518
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,810
nor to please your mother-in-law.

519
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,340
-Can you see this? -Right. You're right.

520
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,130
But don't blame it on me.

521
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm not mad at you.

522
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm mad at myself.

523
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,950
We can't

524
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,400
let a good policeman

525
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,610
make mistakes in our hands, right?

526
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,490
Where are you going?

527
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
To persuade him.

528
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,530
Didn't you just say that

529
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,770
we can't let a good policeman

530
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,840
make mistakes in our hands.

531
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,570
No.

532
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,830
I failed to persuade one.

533
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,560
And then I offended another one.

534
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,370
Hello, Mom.

535
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,080
Come back early today.

536
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,820
I bought a lot of seafood.

537
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,690
I'll cook for you tonight.

538
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,610
Mom, what did you say

539
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,890
to my Master and the leaders again?

540
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,360
They told me

541
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,290
about your being selected as an advanced individual.

542
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,520
That's what you deserve.

543
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,530
You've already made contributions.

544
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,520
If you have more honors like this,

545
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,280
you may be transferred to the bureau.

546
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
Then you won't need to be working in the front line.

547
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,980
Jie.

548
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,300
How could you hang up on me?

549
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,130
Mom, I've told you many times.

550
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,430
Don't interfere with my work.

551
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,730
Why can't you listen to

552
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,920
even one word of mine?

553
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm doing this for your own good.

554
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,870
Otherwise

555
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,080
everyone will forget us.

556
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,900
Mom, I am officially informing you that

557
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,270
I've moved out.

558
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,810
It's close to the office and convenient to work.

559
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,440
When you stop

560
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,370
calling my leaders over and over again,

561
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,350
I will return home.

562
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,400
Morning, Cao.

563
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,080
Morning, Cao.

564
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,720
Time to go home.

565
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:09,770
Morning.

566
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
Shu, you're early.

567
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,610
Morning, Cao.

568
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,520
We live nearby.

569
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,880
It's good to be young.

570
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,930
No family for you to worry about.

571
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,440
It's good for your career, right?

572
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,320
Morning, Jianjun.

573
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,840
Morning.

574
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,880
Morning, Cao.

575
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,650
-Morning. -What should we do, Xu?

576
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,110
Let Du have a look.

577
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,600
Morning.

578
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,550
Be careful, Dawei.

579
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,840
Cheng, are you on night duty?

580
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,010
Any case?

581
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,770
Nothing. Nothing happened.

582
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,540
Don't ask around.

583
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,340
What's wrong with asking a few questions?

584
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,690
A policeman should not ask whether there is any case.

585
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,090
If you ask, cases will come.

586
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:04,890
So superstitious.

587
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,410
Master, let me get you some water.

588
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,480
I just got it.

589
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,640
Officer Chen.

590
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,080
We received a report from Xiaoxin Village.

591
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,880
There is a conflict on the road.

592
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,750
Some guys are fighting there.

593
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,730
What a jinx!

594
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,430
Chen.

595
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:21,990
I'll go.

596
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,560
Ding, Yang Shu, get to work.

597
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,770
Master.

598
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,320
When can we respond to some reports?

599
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,410
Our job is to detect the alarm

600
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,350
and send them to work.

601
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,610
Let them work.

602
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,860
Let's go.

603
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,240
Let's go to the community.

604
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,000
Master, I haven't...

605
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,930
Master.

606
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,890
Officer Chen.

607
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,040
There's a fight on bus 323.

608
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,720
They're at the bus station.

609
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,450
Deal with it.

610
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,730
The report is coming, Master.

611
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,530
I can't even drink water peacefully.

612
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,750
You are a jinx.

613
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,300
Let's go.

614
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,080
Your dog scared my child first.

615
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,310
Why are you so unreasonable?

616
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,210
We have to make it clear today.

617
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,120
Why?

618
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,850
It's a big scene.

619
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,290
Yang Shu, no matter what happens,

620
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
isolate them first.

621
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,030
Make it as small as possible.

622
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,930
Don't stimulate the conflict.

623
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,750
You got it?

624
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,040
Turn on the body camera.

625
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,490
You yelled at my dog.

626
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,100
No.

627
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,370
Can you be reasonable?

628
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,710
How could you do that?

629
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,150
The police are here.

630
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,800
You talk about it with the police.

631
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,880
I can't make sense to you.

632
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,200
Fine.

633
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,500
Sir! Sir!

634
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,250
Enough. Stop arguing.

635
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,080
Stop arguing.

636
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,210
You're younger than him. Stop talking.

637
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,900
Sir,

638
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,670
you're not young anymore.

639
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,060
Don't get angry so easily.

640
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,190
It's not worth it.

641
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:27,370
[Team 3 Body Camera]

642
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Tell me what happened.

643
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,550
Officer.

644
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,760
I called the police. I'll tell you about it.

645
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,600
This old man went out to walk the dog.

646
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,500
Look. It's such a big dog. And he didn't leash it.

647
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,430
We passed by here.

648
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,570
The dog ran after my child and bit him.

649
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,560
Look.

650
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,750
Look at his leg.

651
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,540
Look at his mouth.

652
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,340
Watch out for the bruise.

653
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,080
Look how badly he is crying.

654
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,950
Look at his mouth.

655
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,600
It's all because of this dog.

656
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,880
We didn't say anything.

657
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,390
We didn't ask for compensation, did we?

658
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,570
Compensate your ass.

659
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,990
Listen to what he said.

660
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,710
Sir. Sir.

661
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,010
I walk my dog. Is there any business with you?

662
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,450
Your child is afraid of dogs.

663
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,990
Don't pass by the door if you're afraid of dogs.

664
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,140
Sir. Sir.

665
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,240
Listen to me.

666
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,480
How can you be so excited at your age?

667
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,410
Yang Shu, Ding.

668
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,170
Take him inside to cool down.

669
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:52,800
OK.

670
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,090
Come in, Sir.

671
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,920
It's cooler inside.

672
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,430
This is in the city.

673
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,130
You have to leash such a big dog.

674
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,240
It's not in the countryside.

675
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,940
If you want to go, go now.

676
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,650
Do you know what is to respect the elderly?

677
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,910
Can you keep calm?

678
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,350
Don't talk.

679
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,370
You called the police?

680
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,690
Please show me your ID card.

681
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,290
ID card.

682
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,130
Mom. I want to go home.

683
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,200
Right away.

684
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,230
There you go.

685
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,060
Liu Qiang. Mr. Liu.

686
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,000
Calm down.

687
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,160
Why are you wasting your time with him?

688
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,590
Officer.

689
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,990
This old man...

690
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,810
I've never met such an unreasonable person.

691
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Everybody, that's enough. Be quiet.

692
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,870
Did you have your ID card?

693
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,630
What?

694
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,390
This is my home.

695
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,440
I'm at home.

696
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,880
Why do I need my ID card?

697
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,450
My child got hurt.

698
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,590
I didn't say anything about it.

699
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,790
But he blackmailed me.

700
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,370
A bunch of people surrounded me and didn't let me go.

701
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,920
How could I not call the police?

702
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:53,930
I know.

703
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,800
It must be his fault.

704
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,380
But look at him.

705
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,680
He's obviously a new one here due to the city renovation.

706
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:00,910
You two

707
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,060
are educated people.

708
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,410
Let's not lower ourselves to his level, OK?

709
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,690
To be honest,

710
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,560
I didn't want to lower myself to his level.

711
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,600
But he blackmailed me.

712
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,830
There are rules for raising dogs

713
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,740
in the city.

714
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,030
-You must have a dog license. -And I'm telling you.

715
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,650
I raise dogs all my life,

716
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,190
but I've never got any certificates before.

717
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,580
Sir, I don't care about before.

718
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,400
You are already a city resident now.

719
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,280
If you live in the city,

720
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,860
you must follow the city rules.

721
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,590
-Cut it out. -You must have a dog license.

722
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,700
You must leash it while walking the dog.

723
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,770
Don't tell me about this.

724
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,430
I don't care about the city or the countryside.

725
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,630
I only know this is my home,

726
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,560
my place.

727
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,490
I can walk the dog wherever I want.

728
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,560
I can raise the dog in whatever way I like.

729
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,210
I guess he knew he was wrong.

730
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,330
He was afraid you would ask for compensation,

731
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,570
so he got the drop on you

732
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,670
and gave you no chance.

733
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,160
I didn't plan to

734
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,780
put an old man on the spot.

735
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,390
But he didn't even listen to one word of mine.

736
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,290
What should I do?

737
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,650
OK, I got it.

738
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,770
How about this?

739
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,700
Please be generous.

740
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,190
I'll mediate later.

741
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,970
Both sides will say something nice.

742
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,200
Let's try to reconcile.

743
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,790
OK?

744
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,520
OK.

745
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,370
Baby, let's listen to the police, OK?

746
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,420
The police are here.

747
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,679
Let me correct it for you.

748
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,420
Legally speaking,

749
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,090
it's not that this place belongs to you

750
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,120
wherever you stands.

751
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,790
This is a public place. It belongs to all of us.

752
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,639
Law?

753
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,280
You're pressuring me with the law.

754
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,929
Let me tell you.

755
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,540
I'm over 70 years old.

756
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,040
If you have the guts,

757
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,530
come arrest me.

758
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,760
Arrest me.

759
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,820
Calm down.

760
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,699
I am not saying I'm going to arrest you.

761
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,469
Please control yourself.

762
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,469
Calm down.

763
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,449
Calm down, OK?

764
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,190
Sir, calm down.

765
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,040
We are not going to arrest you.

766
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,790
I just want to ask

767
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,960
if you have a dog license.

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,790
It's none of your business.

769
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,489
Sir. Sir.

770
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,650
Look at me.

771
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,840
Don't stare at them.

772
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:40,960
Logically,

773
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,659
you should have a dog license in the city.

774
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,440
And you need to leash the dog when you take him out.

775
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,620
But

776
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
Mr. Liu thinks

777
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,540
you may be old.

778
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,239
There are some things you don't know.

779
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,830
So, he is willing to understand you.

780
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,659
Do you think we should come to a settlement?

781
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,820
Now I see.

782
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,550
Did he call you here?

783
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,000
So you are just on his side, right?

784
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,790
All right.

785
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,190
Since you are biased,

786
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,620
just arrest me.

787
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,890
-Arrest me. Arrest me. Arrest me. -Don't.

788
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,300
Sir, please don't do this.

789
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,600
Let me tell you.

790
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,190
I'll sue you if you don't arrest me.

791
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,770
Sir, please calm down.

792
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,490
Calm down.

793
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,750
It's so hot. Don't get irritated.

794
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,360
All right.

795
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,430
Calm down. No problem.

796
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,720
Ask him to pay.

797
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,880
I won't be angry if he pays me.

798
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,490
I won't be angry if you pay me.

799
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,960
Keep your dog under control, OK?

800
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,110
Sir, you...

801
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,350
You want me to give you money?

802
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,280
Fine, I will do it.

803
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,370
You pay for our child's mental damage

804
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,860
and the time we wasted,

805
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,300
Then I'll pay you, OK?

806
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,970
You haven't grown up yet. I'll pay you my ass.

807
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,040
I'll beat you up.

808
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,160
What are you talking about?

809
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,680
Calm down. Don't be angry.

810
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,330
Think about your health, Sir.

811
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,120
Don't fight.

812
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,260
-You live in vain at such an old age. -Stop it.

813
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,730
-Such an old age. -Stop it.

814
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
Dare you say it again?

815
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,010
You live in vain at such an old age.

816
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,290
Sir, calm down.

817
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,920
Calm down.

818
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,680
Sir. Sir.

819
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,150
Hello.

820
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,330
Hello.

821
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,000
Hello, this way please.

822
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,890
What's going on?

823
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,880
Here's the situation.

824
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,070
They are arguing inside.

825
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,800
How did your parents educate you?

826
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,960
How dare you hit me?

827
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,920
I won't let you off!

828
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,120
Remember.

829
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,750
I'll fight with you with my life today.

830
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,410
I'm telling you.

831
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,550
Stop arguing. Police are here.

832
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,610
So what?

833
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,640
Who do you think you are?

834
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,330
Listen.

835
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,980
You are full of dirty words.

836
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,090
You disrespect your old age.

837
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,600
What did I do wrong?

838
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,470
You hit me?

839
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,410
Who do you think you are?

840
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,360
You hit me?

841
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,250
Look what she did to me.

842
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,440
I have nothing nice to say.

843
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,360
How dare you hit me?

844
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,770
Even my grandson is older than you.

845
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,200
Enough. Stop arguing.

846
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,660
Sir, watch your mouth.

847
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,760
Why should I watch my mouth?

848
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,910
She hit me and I should watch my mouth?

849
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,900
Enough.

850
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,240
Stop arguing.

851
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,220
What happened?

852
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,310
Can someone tell me?

853
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,060
I will tell you.

854
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,200
She hit me.

855
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,600
I'm dying.

856
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,270
Take me to the hospital.

857
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,250
I can't live anymore.

858
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,290
I can't live anymore.

859
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,520
Can't you take care of the elderly?

860
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,070
Understood?

861
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,570
What are you doing?

862
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,510
You're at such an old age.

863
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,370
It's not over.

864
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,290
He's just an old hooligan.

865
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,730
What are you talking about?

866
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,850
Right. We can't say that.

867
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,600
We can't afford to offend the elderly.

868
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,840
Master.

869
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,850
That old man provoked at first.

870
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,030
And he was on the running bus.

871
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,570
It's suspected of harming public safety.

872
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,510
Why should we mediate?

873
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,480
Just arrest him.

874
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,270
Li Dawei,

875
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,730
You've been quiet for two days.

876
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,220
And you can't sit still now with your monkey ass.

877
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,990
Are you trying to be brave?

878
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,060
Have I ever been quiet?

879
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,160
Besides, we're talking about the case.

880
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,340
What does it have to do with the monkey's ass?

881
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,860
Didn't you learn the Law on Penalties for Administration of Public Security

882
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,720
in the police academy?

883
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,930
I did.

884
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,590
What's the rule of Clause 3 Article 21?

885
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,600
For those over seventy years of age,

886
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,320
they can no longer be administratively detained.

887
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,690
You still remember it.

888
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,570
By your definition,

889
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,900
we can do nothing with those old villains?

890
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,040
What do you mean by my definition?

891
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,650
That's the punishment rule.

892
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,450
Did you see the surveillance footage?

893
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,580
Yes.

894
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,690
The female passenger also hit him

895
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,410
and scratched his face.

896
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,830
It was self-defense.

897
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,850
What do you mean?

898
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,470
Strictly speaking,

899
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,560
it's called fistfight, you know?

900
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:38,890
In that case,

901
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,390
we have to arrest that woman if we want to.

902
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,210
So what?

903
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,490
Look at that old man.

904
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,490
He's over 70 years old.

905
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,980
We can only arrest that woman.

906
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,690
This is so unfair.

907
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,010
Old people need to be taken care of.

908
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,450
Women and children need protection too.

909
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,500
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

910
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,660
Go and find out

911
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,700
the exact age of the old man.

912
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,760
I'll talk with the female passenger.

913
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,590
She's still young.

914
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,270
She is reasonable and can talk nicely.

915
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,090
The old man is 71 years old.

916
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,310
He got on the bus a car with his senior citizen card.

917
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,380
His age is on his card.

918
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,930
Well, you don't have to go.

919
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,060
Come with me to talk to that female passenger.

920
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,400
Help!

921
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,180
Baby! Baby!

922
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,140
What's wrong?

923
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,650
What happened to him?

924
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,460
What happened?

925
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,310
Call an ambulance!

926
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,500
Come on. Get in our car.

927
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,890
Get in our car.

928
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,790
Let's go.

929
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,780
It's OK.

930
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,100
The police are gone.

931
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,360
They are gone.

932
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,710
The kid fainted.

933
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,660
He was sent to the hospital.

934
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,460
Doctor.

935
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,620
Calm down.

936
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:56,920
Doctor!

937
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,550
Doctor, please take a look.

938
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,780
Doctor, please take a look at my child.

939
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,530
What happened to him?

940
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,510
He fainted in the car.

941
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
Take your time.

942
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,540
Please calm down.

943
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,280
How old is your child?

944
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,960
Let me register.

945
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,390
One year old.

946
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,020
One year old.

947
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,840
Does he have allergic symptoms?

948
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,850
No, no.

949
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,850
OK. Any obvious symptoms?

950
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,750
No, none.

951
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,900
Look what happened to him.

952
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,400
Don't worry. Don't worry.

953
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,080
Did you bring your medical card?

954
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,030
No.

955
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,800
Officer.

956
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,490
Don't let her run away.

957
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,680
Don't let her run away.

958
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,140
She needs to pay for my treatment.

959
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,450
Sir, you are sick.

960
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,700
-No. -Don't worry.

961
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,330
No.

962
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,850
Why is this old man here?

963
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,500
I think he's pretending to be sick.

964
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,020
You're smart.

965
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,930
Do you think the doctor can't find it out?

966
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,450
Right.

967
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,880
You will know I am right when the doctor finds it out.

968
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,090
Where are we going now?

969
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,370
Liu, take them to the pediatrics.

970
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,240
OK. Thank you.

971
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:37,790
This way.

972
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,730
You go ahead. This way.

973
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,570
Watch your step.

974
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,160
Where?

975
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,350
This way. This way.

976
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,350
OK, you go ahead. OK.

977
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,450
Doctor, what's wrong with me?

978
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,370
Let's talk over there.

979
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,800
Sir.

980
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,300
Is the patient's family here?

981
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,160
I've called them.

982
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,120
How is the patient?

983
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,190
Nothing's wrong with him.

984
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,930
His blood pressure, blood fat and  blood sugar

985
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,010
are normal.

986
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,720
The cardiovascular vessel is fine.

987
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,540
OK, thank you.

988
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,450
It's my duty.

989
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,390
If them can't find out the problem,

990
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,410
should he be transferred to a bigger hospital

991
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,360
and got a check again?

992
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,600
Let's wait until the family members come.

993
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,120
So many weirdos in this society.

994
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,590
What do you mean?

995
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,710
What a coincidence

996
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,730
to meet you here.

997
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,490
Dawei.

998
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,850
Officer Chen.

999
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,890
Jianjun.

1000
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,770
You are also here.

1001
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,410
What happened?

1002
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,510
Don't mention it. The involved guy fainted.

1003
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,570
I think you and your Master are fine.

1004
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,640
It's fine.

1005
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,340
What else can I do?

1006
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,190
Just be ordinary colleagues.

1007
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,370
I don't think this will work.

1008
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,590
You should talk to him

1009
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,800
and get along with him.

1010
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,310
I didn't do anything wrong.

1011
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,920
This is not a matter of right and wrong.

1012
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,840
Why are you so stubborn?

1013
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,500
Besides, he's teaching you.

1014
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,440
How can you just be ordinary colleagues?

1015
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,680
Do you think what I said makes sense?

1016
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,580
What case is yours?

1017
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,470
To put it simply,

1018
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,940
it's a tragedy caused by a bad old man.

1019
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,350
It's troublesome.

1020
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,650
We have to take care of their health

1021
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,310
and their emotions.

1022
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,990
I got an old man, a child

1023
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,150
and a woman.

1024
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,080
I also got an old man, a child,

1025
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,210
a woman and her husband.

1026
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,530
You win. The situation is more complicated than mine.

1027
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:49,940
Don't stop me.

1028
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,450
Honey.

1029
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,160
Don't stop me!

1030
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,110
Don't stop me.

1031
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,790
I'm going to get even with that old man!

1032
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,610
Honey.

1033
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,780
Don't stop me.

1034
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:56,900
Don't stop me.

1035
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,090
Calm down.

1036
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,700
I don't believe there's no law here.

1037
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,320
♫Like a seed♫

1038
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,650

1039

What did I do in my previous life?

1061
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,630
I'm terminally ill when I am old.

1062
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,100
I was driven out by them.

1063
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,170
Why are people like this nowadays?

1064
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,080
I...

1065

I really deserve it.
