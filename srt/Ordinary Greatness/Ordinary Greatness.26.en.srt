00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,000
Come on, come on. Fill it up, fill it up.

6
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,800
Fill me up with the white wine.

7
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,460
Drink up.

8
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,100
How many glasses of wine did my master drink?

9
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,780
Three or five glasses of wine.

10
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,370
He was so happy that he drank a little fast today.

11
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,729
Master, master, master.

12
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,050
Stop drinking.

13
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,940
You drank too much alcohol.

14
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,430
-Too much.
-Do you hear?

15
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,540
My apprentice lectures me.

16
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,500
You also lecture me?

17
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,100
Tell me the truth, Yang Shu.

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,900
Do you despise me, too?

19
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,259
Master, how is that possible?

20
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,220
You'll get drunk if you drink any more. Stop drinking.

21
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,900
You've had enough.

22
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,540
Give me the wine.

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,460
No, no. No alcohol.

24
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,220
-Young man. -It's fine.

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,130
Your master has a high tolerance for alcohol.

26
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,450
Stop talking to him. Let's drink.

27
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:19,820
Master, master.

28
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,329
Master, you can't drink it like that. Master.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,340
You'll get drunk more easily.

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,900
Master, stop drinking.

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,740
We must drink up the wine today.

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,900
Of course.

33
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,140
Come on, come on, come on.

34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,060
Are you happy?

35
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,140
Yes, yes.

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,700
Kuizi.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,340
I'm absolutely happy.

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,700
Don't drive while you're drunk.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,300
Okay.

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,860
You need a designated driver.

41
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,610
Don't worry. Take care of Master.

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,500
Don't worry. I'll. I'll.

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,060
We all had too much to drink.

44
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,540
I got to go, Jianjun.

45
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,340
Bye. Bye.

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Be careful. Bye.

47
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,660
Let's hang out more often.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,670
Don't drive after drinking.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,380
The designated driver is on his way.

50
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,020
All right.

51
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,860
Young man, listen to your master.

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,570
Goodbye. Goodbye.

53
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,140
Chuan, get in the car.

54
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,050
Slow down!

55
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,370
Master.

56
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,930
Master, are you okay?

57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,260
No problem.

58
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Bye!

59
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,830
See you.

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,820
Let me take you home.

61
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,900
Yang Shu,

62
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,620
you came all this way and I didn't give you a good reception.

63
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,710
It doesn't matter. I'm glad you're happy today.

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,480
Give me the car key.

65
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,579
What's wrong?

66
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
I left my phone on the table.

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,260
Master, master. Don't worry.

68
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,940
Master,

69
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,120
stay here.

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,980
I'll get it for you.

71
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,320
Okay.

72
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,910
Wait for me.

73
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,180
Sir, please wait a moment.

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,020
I'll find you a parking space.

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,240
Sir, didn't you finish your meal?

76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,640
Could you please move your car

77
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,900
and let this car in?

78
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,030
There's no parking space.

79
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,070
Okay.

80
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,420
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

81
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,540
When this gentleman comes out,

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,610
you can park your car in.

83
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,700
Okay.

84
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,220
Why did you drive like that?

85
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,390
Don't you know how to turn straight?

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,900
My car just came out.

87
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,540
You were driving too fast.

88
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,530
You broke the traffic rules. Don't you dare blame me.

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,980
Let's call the police.

90
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,810
I just wanted to... pull over.

91
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,740
Wait, you...

92
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,620
Why are you...

93
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,420
There's a cop over there.

94
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,220
We don't have to call the police.

95
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,050
Wait for me.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,080
Officer!

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,460
Officer!

98
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,620
Han, there's an accident.

99
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,460
I'll take a look.

100
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,860
Hello.

101
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,500
Sir.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
What happened?

103
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,180
Look at him.

104
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,640
He didn't let me go straight ahead when he turned a corner

105
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,060
and he hit my car.

106
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,180
Hello.

107
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,190
May I see

108
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,010
your driving licenses, please?

109
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,340
Bro, which branch are you on?

110
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,060
We're all family.

111
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,620
Don't be so serious.

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,170
What do you mean?

113
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,610
I'm from Balihe Police Station.

114
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,260
Let me show you.

115
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,650
What?

116
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,120
So you're a cop!

117
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,730
Give it to me.

118
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,560
I want you to smell the alcohol on him!

119
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,940
Officer,

120
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,060
he's a cop and he's drunk.

121
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,540
What do you suggest we do about this?

122
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,580
Officer! Officer!

123
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,140
It's a misunderstanding.

124
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,060
Madam, it's a misunderstanding.

125
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
Madam, it's a misunderstanding.

126
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,900
Sorry. I'm sorry.

127
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,850
Master.

128
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,130
Officer, here's the thing.

129
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,990
It must be a misunderstanding.

130
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,820
My Master...

131
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,080
He had no intention of driving.

132
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,750
He just... He just moved his car.

133
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,810
I didn't drink.

134
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,409
I came here to drive him.

135
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,180
Madam, he...

136
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,220
- He didn't drive. 
- Blow on it.

137
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,020
He just moved the car.

138
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,140
Just moved the car? He moved his car out onto the road.

139
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,140
He drove drunk into the road.

140
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,740
Be serious!

141
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,420
He hit my car, right?

142
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,900
Let me see his name.

143
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,090
Cao Jianjun, right? Okay.

144
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Officer!

145
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,080
Cao Jianjun, a policeman, was driving under the influence.

146
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,310
What do you suggest we do?

147
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:22,900
Get off the car.

148
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,830
I'm not drunk.

149
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,060
I just wanted to move my car.

150
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,610
Master, master.

151
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,740
What's wrong with you?

152
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,980
What are you doing? What are you doing?

153
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,620
Stop talking.

154
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,580
Stop talking, Master.

155
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,250
Master, don't talk.

156
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,290
Don't be so serious, okay?

157
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,460
Stop talking, Master.

158
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,380
Sir, this...

159
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,970
I know it's our fault.

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,159
It's all our fault.

161
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,990
But here's the thing.

162
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,790
My master...

163
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,409
He had no intention of driving drunk.

164
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,620
He just moved his car.

165
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,659
I... I just went to get his phone

166
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,380
and he's like this.

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
Madam, I'm sorry.

168
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,409
Your car has been damaged.

169
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,860
How would you like us to compensate you?

170
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,900
Or, if you want something,

171
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,780
just tell me.

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,630
We'll do as you ask...

173
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,130
I don't ask for anything!

174
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,220
I just want to see

175
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,100
how traffic cops deal with drunk driving.

176
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,620
My driver's license.

177
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,340
Madam.

178
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,220
Bailihe Police Station?

179
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,340
You're a police officer.

180
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,240
Don't you know you can't drive after drinking?

181
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,340
Officer.

182
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,860
He knows. Of course he knows.

183
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,140
When his friend left,

184
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,380
he called a designated driver for him.

185
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,740
Officer,

186
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,020
he didn't drive very far.

187
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,659
He... He didn't... He just...

188
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,580
He didn't drive?

189
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,770
Then why was he on the road?

190
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,700
Well...

191
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,420
Stop.

192
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,659
You. I'm sorry.

193
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,600
Please follow me.

194
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,420
Where are you taking him?

195
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,440
You want to let him go?

196
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,260
What do you mean?

197
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,140
He's drunk.

198
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,970
I'm taking him back.

199
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,330
What's the matter? You don't trust me?

200
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,820
If you're worried, you can tag along.

201
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,060
Bro,

202
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,250
is it necessary?

203
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,220
Master.

204
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,380
Does the traffic police

205
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,940
stop dealing with police stations?

206
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,980
Master, master!

207
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,270
Stop talking!

208
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,450
Stop talking!

209
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,180
Do you hear me?

210
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,460
What's wrong with me asking him a question?

211
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,690
Stop talking, Master.

212
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,220
Wait, Master,

213
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,650
why did you drive?

214
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,870
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

215
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,419
The waiter... He asked me to move the car.

216
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,310
Why did you listen to him?

217
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,570
Don't you know you're drunk?

218
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,790
I just wanted to pull over.

219
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,410
Fine, fine, fine. Master, master.

220
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,940
Now please calm down and clear your head.

221
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,540
Do you have any idea

222
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,580
how serious it would be

223
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,660
if this got out?

224
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,700
Calm down.

225
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,270
I'll take care of it.

226
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,580
Madam, I'm sorry

227
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,740
for the trouble.

228
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,070
I know it's our fault.

229
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,900
Sorry.

230
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,140
Sir, sir.

231
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,820
How about this?

232
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,260
My master had too much to drink.

233
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,220
I want to take him back first.

234
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,860
Then I'll go back with you.

235
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,020
I'm at your disposal.

236
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,240
He's drunk driving.

237
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,390
Why should I take you back?

238
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,460
No.

239
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,140
Listen to me.

240
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,630
You drive his car

241
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,660
and take him with us.

242
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,300
Yang Shu,

243
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,560
don't do anything.

244
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,560
I'll see what they can do to me.

245
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,490
Master, could you please stop talking?

246
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
It's your fault. Don't you know?

247
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,780
Can we just listen to the traffic police?

248
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,900
What's the big deal?

249
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
Master, I beg you.

250
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,650
Please listen to me, okay?

251
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,120
Calm down.

252
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,540
Clear your head.

253
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,180
Sir,

254
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,370
why don't you get in our car

255
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
and come with us to the police station?

256
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,050
No, I have a car.

257
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,220
Madam,

258
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,200
would you like to go back with us

259
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,860
or hear our verdict later?

260
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,960
I have something to do.

261
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,150
I'll wait at home.

262
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,020
Okay.

263
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,910
Your contact number?

264
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,060
Thank you for your cooperation.

265
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,030
I got it all on tape.

266
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,830
I'll see if you're doing justice!

267
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,310
Sir.

268
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,740
Take him with me.

269
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,360
Master.

270
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Fine.

271
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,540
Master,

272
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,300
you're way off base this time.

273
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,770
Why did you take out your police badge?

274
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,090
Didn't you set yourself on fire?

275
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,980
At this point, Master,

276
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,200
you should take my advice.

277
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,190
When we arrive at the traffic police,

278
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,640
just admit your mistake.

279
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,710
Don't argue with them, okay?

280
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,920
You know what?

281
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,940
I risk my life.

282
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,420
It's harder than standing on the road.

283
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,180
Master, master.

284
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,020
Don't say that

285
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,170
when you get there. Master.

286
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,660
It just makes things worse.

287
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,500
I'll call the Chief.

288
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,260
Don't.

289
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,020
Yang Shu,

290
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,530
don't say anything

291
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,460
about it.

292
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,490
I'm afraid I can't hide it.

293
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,020
Master, wake up.

294
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,930
Give me the car key.

295
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,890
Master, wake up.

296
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,220
I can't believe

297
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,340
you flashed your police badge on the street.

298
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,900
Go.

299
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,810
Let's go.

300
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,890
Master, wake up.

301
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,340
- Officer, officer.
- Over there.

302
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,790
I can explain.

303
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,060
Don't take him in there.

304
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,160
Well, I'm sorry.

305
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
It's none of your business.

306
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,180
Wait here.

307
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,770
Wait, sir, sir.

308
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,900
Please listen to me.

309
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,020
My master lost his head.

310
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,200
The Lotus Mountain.

311
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,830
Do you know about the assault in Lotus Mountain?

312
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,810
My master

313
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,780
solved that case at the risk of his life.

314
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,580
He was just a little happier for the case was solved.

315
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,620
So he had a few more drinks.

316
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,660
He really wasn't going to drive.

317
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,460
Didn't he call me over here?

318
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,570
I just went in and got his...

319
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,470
I just went in and got his phone.

320
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,620
The waiter asked him to move the car.

321
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,740
But I knew

322
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,340
it was my master's fault.

323
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,420
But after all, we're family.

324
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,660
Please bend the rules.

325
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,530
Stop it.

326
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,300
You talk too much.

327
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,980
Wait here.

328
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,250
Go.

329
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,820
Go!

330
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,220
Come here. This way.

331
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,740
Sit there.

332
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,300
There you are.

333
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,420
What would you like to buy today?

334
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,300
Let me have a look.

335
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,240
Have a look.

336
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,580
Hello, how much is corn?

337
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,540
Two yuan a corn.

338
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,210
Your lettuce... is good.

339
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,420
It's fresh today.

340
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,890
The celery is good.

341
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,140
How much is garlic moss?

342
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,250
Five yuan today.

343
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,580
The price has gone up,

344
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,840
50 cents more than yesterday.

345
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,060
One price a day.

346
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,180
Yes, one price a day.

347
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,860
That's all.

348
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,220
I'll give you 50 cents off.

349
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,780
Yang Shu,

350
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,460
this is the first time you've called me.

351
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,420
What's the matter?

352
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,660
What?

353
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,860
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

354
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,820
I'll be right there.

355
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,140
Wang Shouyi.

356
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,580
Take it, take it, take it.

357
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,620
I had something come up.

358
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,540
- Here's another one. - Wang Shouyi!

359
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,010
Wang Shouyi, where are you going?

360
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,810
Balihe?

361
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,020
Here, blow on it.

362
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,620
Bro,

363
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,380
I was wrong.

364
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,470
Is it necessary?

365
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,530
Sir,

366
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,650
this is my job.

367
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
I need your cooperation.

368
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,380
Blow hard!

369
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,500
I heard you got credit.

370
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,660
You must be too happy for your success.

371
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,780
This is called singing before breakfast and crying before night.

372
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,220
It's common sense that

373
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
you can't drive after drinking.

374
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,140
You're a police officer. Don't you know that?

375
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,700
Listen.

376
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,660
You made a big mistake this time.

377
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,040
Stay here. I need to get out of here.

378
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,940
I'm telling you,

379
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,850
you made a big mistake this time!

380
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,460
Here you are.

381
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,190
Keep the change.

382
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,260
Chief.

383
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,180
What happened?

384
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,550
I'm sorry, Chief. I'm sorry.

385
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,420
Don't you dare drive after drinking!

386
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,850
What's wrong with you?

387
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,900
Chief, my master... he had no intention of driving.

388
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,380
The waiter asked him to move the car.

389
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,890
He only moved about 50 meters.

390
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,260
What bad luck.

391
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,700
Chief, you have to do something to save him.

392
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,130
I'm afraid the gods can't help him.

393
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,610
Go, go, go. Let's go inside.

394
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,180
Yang Shu, you're really...

395
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,100
You're such a nerd.

396
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,300
Stop!

397
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,540
Driving under the influence and running away, that's a lot worse!

398
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,300
Don't run!

399
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,510
Stop!

400
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,900
Don't run!

401
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,070
Chief, that's my master's car.

402
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,060
What?

403
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,100
Stop!

404
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,450
Cao Jianjun! Cao Jianjun!

405
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,950
You're mad!

406
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,060
Cao Jianjun!

407
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,140
Hongshan Road. Hongshan Road.

408
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,010
There's a brown SUV

409
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,050
just passed by.

410
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,980
Stop it!

411
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,140
Even if the monk can run away, his temple cannot run with him.

412
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,940
Sir, sir. Hello.

413
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm the Chief of the Balihe Police Station.

414
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,660
My name is Wang Shouyi.

415
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,230
Is Captain Wei here?

416
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,980
Sir,

417
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,020
my man made a mistake.

418
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,380
Give me a moment.

419
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,700
I'll call him right away

420
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,020
and ask him to turn himself in.

421
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,660
Turn himself in? Is it that serious?

422
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,680
What do you think?

423
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,100
Wait, you, you...

424
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,500
No, no, no. Give him a chance.

425
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,860
Give him a chance.

426
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,780
Stop calling!

427
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,460
He can't talk on the phone while driving!

428
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,330
He's so impulsive!

429
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,780
What if he answers the phone and there's another accident?

430
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,250
Right, right, right. You're right.

431
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,820
Sir, find a way to stop him.

432
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,340
We must stop him.

433
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
I gotta take this call.

434
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,340
Okay, okay, okay.

435
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,900
Got it.

436
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,780
He turned a corner

437
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,700
and he had another crash.

438
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,700
We've stopped him.

439
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,060
Oh my God.

440
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,500
Chief,

441
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,060
what will happen?

442
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,180
You're a law student.

443
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,540
What do you think is gonna happen?

444
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,090
I'm sorry, Chief.

445
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,900
I'm half to blame for this.

446
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,390
You've told me again and again.

447
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,690
Why didn't I insist...

448
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,460
Why didn't I insist on stopping him?

449
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,060
My master

450
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,380
is a very simple man.

451
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,300
He's just happy today.

452
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,980
He made a contribution.

453
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,340
He held his head up.

454
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,700
He got a little bit carried away.

455
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,610
Chief,

456
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,540
we have to do something to save him.

457
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,010
You also know he's a pretty simple person?

458
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,380
I'm sorry, Chief.

459
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,860
I didn't keep an eye on him.

460
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,380
I...

461
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,900
I'll take responsibility for him.

462
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,860
Chief, I'll take care of it, okay?

463
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,980
Everyone should be responsible for his own life.

464
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,820
How do you take responsibility for him?

465
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,920
There are things we can help him with,

466
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,530
but there're things we can't.

467
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,220
He's not gonna be able to

468
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,290
do this job.

469
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,700
Whether he'll be sentenced or not

470
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,550
depends on how much he drank

471
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,770
and whether it meets the criteria for drunk driving.

472
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,020
Even if he doesn't,

473
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,940
two accidents and a hit-and-run,

474
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,890
Jianjun is doomed.

475
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,100
Chief.

476
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,700
I need to get in there and find their captain.

477
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,620
Wait here for me.

478
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,860
Chief,

479
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,180
I'll go with you.

480
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,690
I need to see my master.

481
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,540
Okay, let's go.

482
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,980
Here.

483
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,020
Take a look.

484
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,260
The standard for drunk driving

485
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,420
is 80 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood.

486
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,330
He's 127.

487
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,360
This is definitely drunk driving.

488
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,580
Plus two traffic accidents

489
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,980
and a hit-and-run.

490
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,260
I don't know whether he's gonna be detained.

491
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,500
Detain?

492
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
That is a light punishment.

493
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:17,980
Sir,

494
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,540
here's the thing.

495
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,330
He is a policeman in our police station.

496
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,530
He has a lot of work on his hands.

497
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,560
But, once you take him away,

498
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,470
it'll be days before I see him.

499
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,160
I was wondering if I can see him

500
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,110
before you take him into custody.

501
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,550
So I can take over

502
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,410
what he's doing.

503
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,690
Sorry.

504
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,880
Sir,

505
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,100
we are all brother units.

506
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,890
You don't have to be so businesslike.

507
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,110
My man broke the law.

508
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,580
You can do whatever you want with it.

509
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,260
But you can't delay our work, right?

510
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,040
How about this?

511
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,270
You can watch from the sidelines.

512
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,380
Okay?

513
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,360
Where is Captain Wei?

514
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,140
He's not here.

515
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,620
Come in.

516
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,540
Qi, you... you're just in time.

517
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,800
You... You tell him.

518
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,180
Yes,

519
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,500
we did put you to a lot of trouble.

520
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,000
But I have only one request.

521
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,180
Let me see him before you take him into custody.

522
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,780
Okay.

523
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,580
Well,

524
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,180
bend the rules a little bit.

525
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,960
[Case-handling Area]

526
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,890
Get Cao Jianjun out.

527
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,660
Cao Jianjun, come out. Go there.

528
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,140
Master.

529
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,610
Chief.

530
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,870
Chief, I'm sorry.

531
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

532
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,640
I'm sorry.

533
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,070
I was out of my mind.

534
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,100
We've just been honored.

535
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,260
And you said we were gonna be one of the top 100 in the fourth quarter.

536
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,330
I'm afraid you would be embarrassed

537
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,090
if my story came out.

538
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,620
I don't know what's going on with me. I...

539
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,660
I'm sorry.

540
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,670
All right, stop talking.

541
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,540
Jianjun,

542
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,860
you're gonna have to plead guilty in there

543
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,220
and cooperate with the investigation,

544
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,770
striving for leniency.

545
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,300
Chief, I know.

546
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,170
Can you talk to the superiors

547
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,220
about taking back my second-class merit?

548
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,340
I want to redeem myself.

549
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,780
And let me be a cop,

550
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,250
so that I can redeem myself with credit.

551
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,210
What are you talking about?

552
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,020
You're still drunk?

553
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,890
Master, it's my fault.

554
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,630
I'm half to blame.

555
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,940
- No. - Master.

556
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,150
You should listen to the Chief.

557
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,330
Eat humble pie in there

558
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,660
and ponder your mistake

559
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,460
to strive for leniency.

560
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,980
I don't deserve to be your master.

561
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,420
Find another master in the police station.

562
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,140
No, no. Master.

563
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,210
You'll always be my master.

564
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,420
You're always a good teacher in my heart.

565
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,420
You... You taught me the best lesson.

566
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,460
Yang Shu, enough.

567
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,100
Yang Shu,

568
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,440
control your emotions.

569
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,680
If you have something to tell your family,

570
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,170
just tell me.

571
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,740
Chief,

572
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,890
could you keep this a secret from my family?

573
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,180
How could you...

574
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,500
Because I...

575
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,380
Zhou Hui gets chewed out

576
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,460
by her mother all day in her family.

577
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,700
I don't know what her mother will say this time.

578
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,820
Why don't you care what people say?

579
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,940
Think about it.

580
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,250
Do you have anything to say to Zhou Hui?

581
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,020
No.

582
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,300
She wants me to be a good cop,

583
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,540
so she never lets me interfere in family affairs.

584
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,100
If you see her, tell her

585
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,330
I'm sorry to her and the kid.

586
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,060
Okay, okay, okay.

587
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,620
I know.

588
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,820
All right.

589
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,180
All right.

590
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,370
Chief Wang,

591
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,330
we should go.

592
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,660
Okay, okay, okay. It'll be over soon.

593
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,810
It'll be over soon.

594
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,580
Okay, Jianjun.

595
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,220
Master your emotions.

596
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,220
Master,

597
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,060
take care.

598
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,300
I'll wait for you to come out.

599
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,700
I'll wait for you to come out.

600
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,430
All right.

601
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,760
Chief,

602
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,780
can I still be a cop?

603
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,340
Can I?

604
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,730
So that's it.

605
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,680
Okay, thank you.

606
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,020
Sorry for the trouble.

607
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,330
No, thank Captain Wei

608
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,720
for me.

609
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,310
Okay, I will. Take care.

610
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:14,940
Okay.

611
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,340
His phone has been ringing.

612
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,260
Looks like it's his wife.

613
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,660
I didn't know what to tell his family,

614
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,540
so I didn't answer it.

615
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,700
Thank you.

616
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,210
Let's go.

617
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,500
All right.

618
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Stop crying.

619
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,490
Let's think about

620
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,020
what are we gonna tell his family.

621
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,660
Chief,

622
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,550
my master...

623
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,960
Is he really finished?

624
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,700
What are you talking about?

625
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,930
He can't be a cop so he's done?

626
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,680
It may be true for others.

627
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,710
But as far as my master is concerned,

628
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,330
if he can't be a cop, he's done.

629
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,100
Yang Shu,

630
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,540
stop it.

631
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,540
Let's not think about it.

632
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,240
Let's go to his house.

633
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,179
Please, pick up the phone. Has something happened?

634
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,540
Who is it?

635
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,940
Hello, I'm Wang Shouyi.

636
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,770
Chief Wang,

637
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,050
what happened to Jian Jun?

638
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,260
This is Yang Shu, Jianjun's apprentice.

639
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,790
Can we talk inside?

640
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,220
Where is the kid?

641
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,060
She was in bed already.

642
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
What's wrong with him?

643
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,060
Zhou Hui,

644
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,180
you need to be strong.

645
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,100
Jianjun...

646
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,740
He lost his head with joy.

647
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,020
He drove after drinking and had an accident.

648
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,660
Where is he? Is he okay?

649
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,140
He's fine.

650
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,380
The accident was not big.

651
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
But he...

652
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,140
He was driving under the influence.

653
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,650
And he ran away after the accident.

654
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,330
He was detained by the traffic police.

655
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,340
Zhou Hui,

656
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,980
you need to control your emotions.

657
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,700
Don't think too much about it.

658
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,220
I'm fine.

659
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,290
I heard

660
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,820
he had an accident,

661
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,360
I was...

662
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,340
How is he now?

663
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,540
Can I go see him?

664
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,740
Before we came here,

665
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,140
Yang Shu and I went to the traffic police station to see him.

666
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,180
Everything is fine.

667
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,060
I'm afraid you won't see him for a while.

668
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,180
Driving under the influence,

669
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,940
two accidents and a hit-and-run.

670
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,180
Just be prepared.

671
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,860
You mean

672
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,780
he can't be a cop anymore?

673
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,400
It's worse than that.

674
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,860
Chief Wang,

675
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,430
you will help him, right?

676
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,490
Zhou Hui, you should know,

677
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,570
there are things we can help

678
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,340
and things we can't.

679
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,540
Jianjun

680
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,390
can't avoid the legal responsibility this time.

681
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,100
Okay.

682
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,380
But he's fine, right?

683
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,050
Yes, he's fine.

684
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,060
And the other person is fine?

685
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,620
Yes.

686
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,730
That's good.

687
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,860
He's fine and the other person is fine.

688
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,030
What could be better than that?

689
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,020
I can keep it up.

690
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,260
But Chief Wang,

691
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,860
Jianjun

692
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,110
has devoted himself to his work for over ten years.

693
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,980
I hope you can keep him.

694
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,260
Zhou Hui,

695
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,330
on behalf of the station,

696
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,300
I'd like to say something to you.

697
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,180
No matter what happens to Jianjun,

698
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,100
as long as you tell us,

699
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,260
we'll do our best

700
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,480
in your family affairs.

701
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,660
I'm fine.

702
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,180
He doesn't care about his family.

703
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,690
so I just assume he is on a business trip.

704
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,380
Chief Wang,

705
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,580
thank you

706
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,980
for bringing the news to me at this late hour.

707
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
Thank you.

708
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,970
I should be.

709
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,340
Well,

710
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,980
I won't keep you then.

711
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,180
Thank you.

712
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,970
Well, it's getting late.

713
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,810
Go to bed early.

714
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,700
Madam,

715
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,140
He's my master.

717
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,170
I didn't take good care of him.

718
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,180
I'm sorry

719
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,330
for what happened to him.

720
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,660
You're Yang Shu, right?

721
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,110
Your master

722
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,310
told me a lot about you.

723
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,510
He said you're educated and promising.

724
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,900
He doesn't deserve to be your master.

725
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,530
You are never gonna see each other again.

726
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,090
Get over him.

727
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,580
You go back.

728
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,660
All right, let's go.

729
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,370
Call us if anything happens.

730
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,620
All right.

731
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,660
Thank you.

732
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,510
Cao Jianjun doesn't know he is born.
