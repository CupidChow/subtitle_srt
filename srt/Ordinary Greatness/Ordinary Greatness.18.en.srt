[Once a master]

5
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,450
What are you doing?

6
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,750
My business has nothing to do with you.

7
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,979
Say it again, it has nothing to do with me!

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,120
I could say a hundred times!

9
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,320
My business has nothing to do with you.

10
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,100
Leave me alone!

11
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,979
I'm your dad!

12
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,330
If it's not my business, then whose business is it?

13
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,030
Is this a place for decent kids to come?

14
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,420
It has nothing to do with me.

15
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,390
Who are you to tell me what to do?

16
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,850
Are you qualified?

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,479
Just because I'm your dad, enough?

18
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,900
You are my dad.

19
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,410
Now you remember you are my dad?

20
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,830
You're my dad. What have you done for me?

21
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,660
Where were you

22
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,650
when I was most aggrieved and scared?

23
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,180
Where were you

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,200
when I couldn't sleep

25
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,440
and hid in the quilt all night crying?

26
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,650
Why didn't you think about me

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,240
when I begged you not to divorce?

28
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,740
How?

29
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,690
Now you feel ashamed of me?

30
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,220
You came here to act as a father

31
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,230
to discipline me?

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,060
It's too late.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,110
Jia. Jia. Jia.

34
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,180
Jia. Jia. Jia. Jia.

35
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,460
Yes, you're right.

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,340
You're right.

37
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,050
Listen to me.

38
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,840
You can do whatever you want after that, okay?

39
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,230
Let me finish. Let me finish.

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,410
You're right.

41
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,980
It's my fault. I'm not a good father.

42
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,740
Just vent your anger on me.

43
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,660
Come on.

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,790
You can hit me.

45
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,490
OK?

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,510
But you're my only daughter.

47
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,250
You are my only family.

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,820
We...

49
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,720
We used to be good, right?

50
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,630
You've been willing to play with me since childhood.

51
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,450
Ride around on my neck,

52
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,480
like riding a horse.

53
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,820
What should we do now?

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,180
You can go to work.

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,320
But here isn't where you could hold.

56
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,550
After you go in, it will...

57
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,450
Your life will be ruined, you know?

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,840
Don't you like drawing?

59
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,620
Isn't... Isn't it good?

60
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,830
You... You go.

61
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,510
If here is not good enough,

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,420
you can go to Beijing.

63
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,110
You... You can study abroad.

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,720
I have no money.

65
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,660
But I could be a beggar.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,210
I could... I could sell my kidneys.

67
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,540
I could sell my kidneys and my liver.

68
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,420
I'll support you, okay?

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,890
I've grown up.

70
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,530
I don't need any of you.

71
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,820
I do want to learn painting.

72
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
Don't care what I rely on.

73
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,780
I can make my own money anyway.

74
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,260
You should go.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
Appearing in this kind of place

76
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,829
is not good for you, Officer Chen.

77
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,579
Chen Jiajia. Stay here!

78
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,860
Chen Jiajia, I tell you,

79
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,660
if you dare to take a step into this place,

80
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,360
I'll smash it up, believe it or not!

81
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,250
Come on. Go ahead.

82
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,710
Try to go!

83
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,900
Go!

84
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,150
Do you think I don't know

85
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,370
being here

86
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,340
is not the right thing for a decent girl to do?

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,410
But do I have any other choice?

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,380
Do I have any other choice? You tell me!

89
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,860
Do I have a home?

90
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,380
No, I don't!

91
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,029
Jia!

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,780
Bro, you're here.

93
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,940
Let's go in and have a drink.

94
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,100
Let's have a drink. Hurry up.

95
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,020
The wine is ready.

96
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,420
If we detain back

97
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,620
this kind of punks,

98
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,940
the procedure will take two days.

99
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,800
Then you have to release them after two days.

100
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,260
You might as well

101
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,060
scare them a few words at the scene

102
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,890
and finally let them disperse, you know?

103
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,700
Give me the key.

104
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,820
So this kind of thing

105
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,770
can't be finished by the police.

106
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,100
And it's not just the police

107
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,310
who can manage, either.

108
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,280
That's why it's called comprehensive management, right?

109
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,380
Chief, what are you doing here?

110
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,920
Chief, what's up?

111
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,730
Have you been with your master

112
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,730
during the day today?

113
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,810
Yes.

114
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,980
Did he do anything unusual?

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,670
Chief, what happened to my master?

116
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,620
It's just I can't reach him right now.

117
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,890
He's not picking up the call.

118
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,420
And he didn't reply to my messages.

119
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,490
When he came this afternoon,

120
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,820
he came back and asked for leave in a panic.

121
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,170
I'm a little worried.

122
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,220
Before going back to the station today,

123
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,030
he answered a phone call from someone.

124
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,880
He was in a bad mood.

125
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,960
Don't look at me.

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,140
Chief.

127
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,010
I'm not pushing it.

128
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,930
Bro Chen

129
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,330
is sensitive about his reputation, right?

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,510
If I get involved,

131
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,060
I don't think it's appropriate.

132
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
I'll do it.

133
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,590
Chief, I'm his apprentice.

134
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,150
If anything goes wrong,

135
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,570
it's okay for master to blame.

136
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,620
Well,

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,790
now the only clue

138
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,650
to find your master

139
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,300
is his ex-wife and his daughter.

140
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,780
But I guess

141
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,900
it's probably

142
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,260
have something to do with them.

143
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,390
Especially his ex-wife,

144
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,310
After she got divorced,

145
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,950
she avoided all of our colleagues.

146
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,930
And she doesn't see me anymore.

147
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,880
She has never seen me.

148
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,700
I can do it.

149
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,620
Coming.

150
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,980
Are you Aunt Shang?

151
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,760
Looking for the madam?

152
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,020
Wait.

153
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,860
Come in.

154
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,850
Who are you looking for?

155
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,570
Hello, Aunt Shang.

156
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,050
I'm from Balihe Police Station.

157
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,180
I'm Chen Xincheng's apprentice.

158
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,700
I want to see sister Jia.

159
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,290
She's not home.

160
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,720
Didn't your master go to find Jia?

161
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,900
My master went to find Jia?

162
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,560
Yes.

163
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,590
But he's out of touch now.

164
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,610
We can't reach him.

165
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,090
Is sister Jia not back?

166
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,220
No.

167
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
I've thought Jia was with your master.

168
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,490
Who?

169
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,140
Looking for Jia.

170
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,020
Go first.

171
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,330
I can't talk to you more now.

172
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,410
Aunt Shang, we have an urgent mission.

173
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,460
We must contact my master.

174
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,299
But I really don't know where he is.

175
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,340
Just go now.

176
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,620
Master, please answer the phone.

177
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,260
Pick up the phone. Pick up. Pick up.

178
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,990
Hello? Hello?

179
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,660
Hello? Master.

180
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,300
Master.

181
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,830
Master, tell me.

182
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,570
Master, where are you?

183
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,930
I... I'm Dawei.

184
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Hello? Hello?

185
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,060
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

186
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,130
Hello? Hello? Master.

187
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,220
I'm Dawei.

188
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,420
Where are you?

189
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,300
I'll go find you.

190
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,620
What?

191
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,810
Bangpeng Street.

192
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,380
Bro, go home to sleep.

193
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,540
We'll close.

194
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,240
Bro. Bro.

195
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,400
Bro!

196
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,430
Master! Master!

197
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:09,980
Bro.

198
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,860
You know him?

199
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,580
Yes.

200
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,780
Go about your business. I'll take care of him.

201
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,020
What?

202
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,300
He hasn't paid yet.

203
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,260
I'll pay.

204
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,520
Fifty-six yuan.

205
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,260
Okay.

206
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,830
Scan here, right?

207
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,690
Just scan here.

208
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,710
Okay.

209
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,460
Get him back. Just go about your business.

210
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,250
I'll take him away. Hurry up.

211
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,020
Master.

212
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,900
Master, get up. He's off work.

213
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,820
Give me...

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,440
Give me more...

215
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,270
Come on.

216
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,300
Come on. Give me more beer.

217
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,500
Master, we should stop.

218
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,260
Let's go home.

219
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,060
Let's go home.

220
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,780
Li Dawei.

221
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,570
Why are you here?

222
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,140
I'm here to pick you up.

223
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,780
Just right. Come on.

224
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,570
All right.

225
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,290
Sit down and have a drink with me.

226
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,780
Master, you've drunk one catty.

227
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,660
Let's go back first.

228
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,380
Go back.

229
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,420
Li Dawei, what's wrong with you?

230
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,100
Nothing.

231
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,850
Tell me.

232
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,820
Nothing.

233
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,580
Let me tell you.

234
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,100
I have money. I can afford it.

235
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,220
Buy me a drink next time.

236
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,380
It's okay.

237
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,900
What happened?

238
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,140
Zhao Jiwei, you'll sleep on the sofa tonight.

239
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,420
OK. What happened?

240
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,170
Don't worry about it.

241
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,530
Don't block the door.

242
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,420
Lie down.

243
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,020
Take a pillow.

244
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Master, what are you looking for?

245
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,630
You're thirsty for water, right?

246
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,580
I'll get it for you.

247
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,380
It's okay.

248
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,550
Dawei, is it really okay?

249
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,540
Master, water.

250
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:18,900
Here's the water.

251
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,740
Slow down.

252
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,700
Be careful. Don't be choked.

253
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,980
Dawei.

254
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,980
Is your master alright?

255
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,700
He drank too much.

256
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,810
Is he...

257
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,880
Did something happen?

258
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,700
Dawei, what can we do?

259
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,050
I don't know.

260
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,730
I just think

261
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,340
my master is not only troubled at the station,

262
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,260
but also at home.

263
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,740
It's not easy.

264
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,760
It's okay. Go to sleep.

265
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,620
Wei, thank you for sleeping on the sofa.

266
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,730
[Jia's mom]

267
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,790
What's wrong with you?

268
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,090
Jia is not home yet.

269
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,430
Aunt, I'm Li Dawei,

270
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,850
Chen Xincheng's apprentice.

271
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
We just met.

272
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,460
Where is Chen Xincheng?

273
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,790
My master can't answer the phone now.

274
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,060
Then you ask him.

275
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,150
His daughter is dying.

276
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,570
Will he do something or not?

277
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,710
Of course he will.

278
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,380
Then let him answer the phone now.

279
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,700
Aunt, how about this?

280
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,140
Tell me first if anything happened.

281
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,100
Or I'll go to find sister Jia.

282
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,440
What?

283
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,240
Bro Li, you're here too.

284
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,339
Drink more.

285
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,430
Are you here to drink?

286
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,820
Why did I hire you?

287
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,780
Hurry up.

288
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,180
There are guests over there. Go.

289
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,100
Hurry up.

290
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,140
Sorry.

291
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,100
I'll have an appointment with this girl.

292
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,580
You?

293
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,770
Handsome, you have good taste.

294
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,780
She's new here.

295
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,330
But there's an extra charge for paying her alone.

296
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,010
I know. You go.

297
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,940
Okay.

298
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,180
This is my name card.

299
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,500
If you come again, ask me to book.

300
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,080
Keep the guest company.

301
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,300
Bro wei.

302
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,490
Don't be afraid.

303
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,060
My name is Li Dawei.

304
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,260
I'm your father's apprentice.

305
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,580
What are you doing?

306
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,780
I'll scream if you keep doing this.

307
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,900
Go ahead.

308
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,620
Let your boss know

309
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
you recruited the police.

310
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,420
Jia.

311
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,360
I've been your dad's apprentice

312
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,470
for months.

313
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,380
I've never seen him

314
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,260
suffer like tonight.

315
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,540
What does it have to do with you?

316
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,200
And what does it have to do with me?

317
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,100
Didn't I tell you?

318
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,440
He's my master. He's your father.

319
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,100
He can't even be a good father.

320
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,700
How can he be a master?

321
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,350
Why do you speak so harshly

322
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,980
at such a young age?

323
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,620
Anyway, he's your father.

324
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,540
If a person who only provides a sperm

325
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,420
is called a father,

326
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,220
then he is.

327
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,660
If you keep talking like that, I'll beat you up.

328
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,420
Go ahead.

329
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,170
If you don't do it, I'll continue.

330
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,450
He doesn't deserve to be a father like that.

331
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,380
Jia.

332
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,060
You've grown up.

333
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,870
If you think your father is useless,

334
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,500
you can be successful.

335
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,850
Why are you torturing him like this?

336
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,170
That's why I'm here.

337
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,660
What do you want to do?

338
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,660
Nothing.

339
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,540
I have a father like him.

340
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,540
I can't blame others.

341
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,700
Since he can't protect me,

342
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,570
I can only rely on myself.

343
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,290
Is something wrong with you?

344
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,300
No.

345
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,730
How old are you?

346
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,660
None of your business.

347
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,400
18? 19?

348
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,340
Why can't you do anything else at such a good age?

349
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,940
You just get angry with your dad.

350
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,780
Is it necessary?

351
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,980
Then come and beat me.

352
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,140
Don't you want to beat me? Come on.

353
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,180
Why are you going back...

354
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,460
Fine.

355
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,470
I won't be angry with you.

356
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,500
I'm your brother anyway.

357
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,620
Whose brother are you?

358
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,410
You.

359
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,810
Your father is my master.

360
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,870
You are his daughter.

361
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,840
If I'm not your brother, who is your brother?

362
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,420
Let's go. I'll take you home.

363
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,330
We can go now.

364
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,320
Jia.

365
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,020
Are you kidding me?

366
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,160
Wei. Don't do this.

367
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,470
Wei. Just like this.

368
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,050
Dawei, put your hands down.

369
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,130
Keep a safe distance of one meter from me.

370
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,060
You carry on my arm, okay?

371
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,130
Come on. It's okay to walk like this.

372
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,260
Dawei, don't joke with me.

373
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,500
I'm on duty.

374
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,450
This is your duty.

375
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,900
Is this an entertainment place?

376
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,590
Is there prostitution or drugs?

377
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,120
Is the fire safety measures sound?

378
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,250
Is there anyone involved in illegal activities?

379
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,440
This is the duty of the police.

380
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,580
Dawei.

381
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,290
You want me to use my power for personal gains.

382
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,580
If someone reported me,

383
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,530
then I'm not a policeman anymore at this time next year.

384
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,580
Zhao Jiwei, let me ask you.

385
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
Is this matter more important

386
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,830
or our friendship?

387
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,730
This is more important.

388
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,340
Are you kidding?

389
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,260
What's more important than me being a policeman?

390
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,310
OK. How about this?

391
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,500
You don't have to go in with Qiancheng.

392
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,660
Just patrol more around here.

393
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,820
Is that okay, boss?

394
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,660
Sure.

395
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,510
As long as you don't let me in,

396
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,460
I can do anything.

397
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,620
Then,

398
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,170
you just stick to the door of the bar.

399
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,760
You can't leave without my permission.

400
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,620
But, Dawei.

401
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,460
You can't go in today.

402
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,380
Don't care about me.

403
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,060
I'm your brother. Of course I'll care about you.

404
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,740
You're so shameless.

405
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,780
If you go in,

406
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,540
I'll find your boss.

407
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,850
What do you want?

408
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,780
You have to ask yourself.

409
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,210
We solve whatever problems we have.

410
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,090
I forbid you to torture my master.

411
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,770
What does it have to do with you?

412
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,060
I told you, he's my master.

413
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,540
I won't allow anyone to do this to him.

414
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,780
Jia.

415
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,770
You're here.

416
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,630
I'll be right there.

417
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,790
Why aren't you going in?

418
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,990
I'll be right there. She's not going today.

419
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,530
Her brother, who is a policeman, won't let her in.

420
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,620
No.

421
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,070
I'll scream if you keep doing this.

422
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,820
Go ahead.

423
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,940
Call the police? I'm the police.

424
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,940
The police are there too.

425
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,180
Call the police.

426
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,370
We'll deal with the alert.

427
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,490
Where is it?

428
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,500
Boss, look over there.

429
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,420
Jia.

430
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,680
Are you the boss here?

431
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,300
Who are you?

432
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,980
I'm a policeman from Balihe Police Station.

433
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,930
This is my sister.

434
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:57,900
Do you understand?

435
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,810
Is there any misunderstanding?

436
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,970
Go on.

437
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,780
Are you crazy?

438
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,540
You're not my brother.

439
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,770
You have nothing to do with me.

440
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,780
He can't discipline me. You can't even discipline me.

441
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,110
Sorry, I have to go to work.

442
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,490
We're legally running.

443
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,480
There's nothing to be afraid of.

444
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,560
I know what you're thinking.

445
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,180
We're fine

446
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,380
and don't want to be watched by the police, right?

447
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,140
I told you, we are in the service industry.

448
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Keep smiling.

449
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,300
Smile. Smile.

450
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,890
Alright.

451
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,700
Go back to work.

452
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,900
Hurry up.

453
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,460
Move. Move.

454
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,040
Jia. Look.

455
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,100
Look at what happened today.

456
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,780
Come.

457
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,140
Well.

458
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,780
Why does your brother look so familiar?

459
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,830
Isn't he the one who ordered you before?

460
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

461
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,660
How about this?

462
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,940
Today you're counted as a day's work.

463
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,540
I'll give you 200 yuan.

464
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,220
I'll transfer it to your phone later.

465
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,080
Go backstage and pack up.

466
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,100
Go back first.

467
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,390
Starting tomorrow,

468
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,100
you don't have to come to work.

469
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,170
Boss. What are you doing here?

470
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,330
What do you mean? Hurry up.

471
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,420
Nothing.

472
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,230
I mean I can't take you anymore.

473
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,750
I just found out

474
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,920
your brother is a policeman.

475
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,940
Why didn't you tell me when you came?

476
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,860
He's not my brother.

477
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,610
Boss, sign here.

478
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,700
Is it Room 3?

479
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,270
It's Mr. Li from Room 6.

480
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,500
Give him a fruit plate.

481
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:32,990
He... OK.

482
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,540
He's really not my brother, boss.

483
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,260
I have nothing to do with him.

484
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,740
You're so funny.

485
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,300
He's here.

486
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,820
And you still say he has nothing to do with you?

487
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,120
Do you think I'm a three-year-old child?

488
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,940
I really don't.

489
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,580
Li.

490
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,100
Is the wine ready in Room 3?

491
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,900
Jia.

492
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,230
Where are you going? I'll drive you.

493
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,980
Don't follow me.

494
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,220
If you keep following me, I'll scream to catch the hooligan.

495
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,980
Scream!

496
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,380
The police are here.

497
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,520
Hurry up! Shout loudly!

498
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,380
Get in.

499
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,700
Who are you to me?

500
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Leave me alone.

501
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,910
Listen.

502
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,780
I won't discipline you if you do anything else.

503
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,180
But if you make my master sad,

504
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,220
I'll discipline you.

505
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,150
He's my master, you know?

506
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,660
I won't allow anyone to do this to him.

507
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,820
Not even you.

508
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,220
Get in.

509
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,220
Hello, mom.

510
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,220
Jie.

511
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,960
I've been busy these days so I didn't call you.

512
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,940
How are you?

513
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,840
Uncle Liang and I went to Lijiang today.

514
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,050
Uncle Liang booked the car.

515
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,260
Your aunt and her husband went there too.

516
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,220
It's good.

517
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,140
I can rest assured

518
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,860
that aunt and Uncle Liang are with you.

519
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,200
Your aunt and me

520
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,700
and Uncle Liang

521
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,400
are going to Xishuangbanna.

522
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,180
Your aunt and Uncle Liang mean

523
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,380
to let me stay longer.

524
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,460
By the way, mom,

525
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,870
I transferred another 5,000 yuan to your card yesterday.

526
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,030
You can spend as much as you want.

527
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,160
Don't be petty.

528
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,860
I'll renew your rent for another month.

529
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,650
You can have fun with your aunt there.

530
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,660
Renew?

531
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,660
Uncle Liang said he can help arrange a house.

532
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,540
Mom, let me renew it for you.

533
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,620
It's more convenient to live in our own house.

534
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,220
Your daughter can make money.

535
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,530
I just got my salary yesterday.

536
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,850
I didn't touch the financial management.

537
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,750
Don't worry.

538
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,810
We can get another sum at the end of the year.

539
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,820
Let go of me!

540
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,060
I can't let you go.

541
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,900
I have to keep you safe, you know?

542
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,940
What happened?

543
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,610
Xia Jie.

544
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,130
I knew you were here.

545
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,650
This is...

546
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,690
Sister Xia Jie.

547
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,220
Jia.

548
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,880
You've grown up so much.

549
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,000
I almost didn't recognize you.

550
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,330
You... You know each other?

551
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,060
Then I won't say much more.

552
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,860
Your sister Xia Jie now is a policeman

553
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,500
in the Balihe Police Station like me.

554
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,890
Sister Xia Jie, you are a policeman now.

555
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,180
Yes.

556
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,270
You think I don't look like a policeman?

557
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,180
Yes.

558
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,020
What are you doing?

559
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,960
Sister Xia Jie, tell Li Dawei

560
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,660
to let me go.

561
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,780
Don't follow me all day.

562
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,780
Fine.

563
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,500
I don't have to follow you.

564
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,930
Then tell your sister Xia Jie.

565
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,940
Tell her

566
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,180
why you don't go to the tutoring class.

567
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,890
Why did you work in a bar?

568
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,820
Why did you make my master sad?

569
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,820
My job is my business.

570
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,610
It has nothing to do with my dad.

571
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,730
All right, you can't interrogate her.

572
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,820
Jia, go sit in my room for a while.

573
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,820
OK.

574
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
Remember to call your mom.

575
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,270
Don't make her worry.

576
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,110
Of course I know. Do I need you to tell me?

577
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,420
Hello, what's up?

578
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,070
Li Dawei, where have you been?

579
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,180
I'm in the supermarket.

580
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,340
I'll buy Jia some snacks,

581
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,460
food and drinks.

582
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,230
That's great.

583
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,900
Jia said she can draw.

584
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,140
We've wanted you to go out

585
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,620
to buy some painting supplies for her.

586
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,860
Sure. What do you need?

587
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,420
She wants a sketch.

588
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,460
She needs pencil of 3H, HB, 2B and 4B

589
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,370
and the sketch paper.

590
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,260
Any size is fine.

591
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,150
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

592
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,290
Bye.

593
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,540
You're back.

594
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,220
Look at what Jia drew for me.

595
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,950
Does it look like? I'll have a look.

596
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,620
Not bad, Jia.

597
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,570
You're capable.

598
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,100
Can you draw one for me?

599
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,780
It'll look more like if draw you with a professional pencil and paper.

600
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,870
Not necessarily.

601
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,860
As long as sister Xia Jie is beautiful, it's easy to draw.

602
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,660
He's too ugly

603
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,760
to draw.

604
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,350
What did you say?

605
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,730
I bought you professional pencils and paper hardly.

606
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,730
Come on, take a look.

607
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,860
See if everything is right.

608
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,730
How about the book?

609
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,770
Is the pencil right?

610
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,560
Here comes the male model.

611
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,970
Do you think it's better for two hands

612
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,310
or one finger?

613
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,090
Don't move.

614
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,820
Isn't this more shocking?

615
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,540
Or like this?

616
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,740
Don't move. It's ugly if you move.

617
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,500
How can you speak so badly?

618
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,140
You...

619
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,210
Xia Jie.

620
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,340
How do you think my clothes are?

621
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,290
Do I need to sort out my clothes?

622
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,010
Cut the crap.

623
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,140
Can you just let her draw?

624
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,180
Or give me a book

625
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,500
to make me look more educated.

626
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,170
Hurry up, Jia.

627
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,090
The uglier he is drew, the better.

628
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,540
Okay, you can move now.

629
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,290
Let me see.

630
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,790
No.

631
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,250
You drew me

632
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,070
and you won't show me?

633
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,850
No.

634
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,490
What did you draw?

635
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,940
Sister. Let me see.

636
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Li Dawei, this is so similar to you.

637
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,700
Let me see.

638
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,340
No.

639
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,900
Be careful, you two. Don't crash.

640
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,700
Give it to me.

641
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Look at you.

642
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,780
I'll teach you a lesson.

643
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,820
Wait and see.

644
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,420
Why are you here?

645
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,380
Jia, didn't you send your mother a message?

646
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,900
Mom, didn't you promise me

647
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,370
that I could sleep with sister Xia Jie tonight?

648
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,220
Jia.

649
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,310
Their house

650
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,170
is small.

651
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,620
I'm afraid you can't sleep well at night.

652
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,450
Your mother and I are worried.

653
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,260
We'll take you back.

654
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,730
Mr. Yu, if you say so,

655
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,900
I'm afraid I have to refute you.

656
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,250
Our place is small,

657
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,410
but Jia is very happy

658
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,400
with us.

659
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,820
And she's 18 years old.

660
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,060
She has the right to decide

661
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,170
where she'll stay tonight.

662
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,580
Am I right, Aunt Shang?

663
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,140
Jia.

664
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,260
I think you should go home with me.

665
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,860
If you're not home,

666
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,880
I'm worried.

667
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,030
Aunt Shang, I'm Xia Jie.

668
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,900
Do you remember me?

669
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,820
Jia used to play with me when she was young.

670
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,820
Don't worry.

671
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,900
We will take good care of her.

672
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,580
Yes, we're all police.

673
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,020
It's safer to be with the police, right?

674
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,740
Then

675
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,140
stay here.

676
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Listen to your brother and sister.

677
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,830
Don't trouble them, okay?

678
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,100
Yes.

679
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,260
Let's go then.

680
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:15,930
Take care.

681
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:18,940
Sorry for the trouble.

682
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,580
It's okay.

683
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,940
Take care.

684
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,340
Take care. Bye.

685
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,420
Jia.

686
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,500
No!

687
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,300
Jia.

688
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
No! Don't touch me!

689
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,220
Jia, wake up!

690
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,490
Jia! Jia!

691
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,450
Sister.

692
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,130
It's okay.

693
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,650
Don't be afraid. You're at my house.

694
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,330
What's the matter? It's only five o'clock.

695
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,790
What are you doing in the morning?

696
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,290
Go to sleep.

697
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,370
I'm going to the toilet.

698
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,179
Let's talk inside.

699
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,630
Tell me. What's going on?

700
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,380
Tell me.

701
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,180
It's Jia.

702
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,540
Jia?

703
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,370
What's wrong with Jia?

704
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,820
Promise me first.

705
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,820
You have to calm down, okay?

706
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,280
Just tell me.

707
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,600
I've seen everything.

708
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,380
Then you promise me,

709
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,500
you must listen to me calmly.

710
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,660
Okay, I promise.

711
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,540
Tell me now.

712
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,420
Jia woke up from a nightmare at midnight.

713
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,020
She showed me her phone.

714
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,060
Is the new homework assigned by the teacher?

715
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,300
Yes.

716
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,560
Not bad.

717
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,840
I think you've improved.

718
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,980
You smell good.

719
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,830
Are you cold?

720
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,430
What are you doing?

721
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,110
Don't touch me!

722
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,540
I'll tell my mom.

723
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,420
I'll kill him.

724
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,010
Don't do this.

725
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,230
You promised me to calm down.

726
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,260
How can I calm down?

727
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,170
I'll teach him a lesson.

728
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,040
What are you doing, Li Dawei?

729
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,750
I'll give him a lesson.

730
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
You'll make a big mess.

731
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,740
What do you want Jia to do?

732
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,060
She kept telling me

733
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,980
not to tell anyone.

734
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,280
Do you want the whole world to know?

735
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,700
Have you thought for her?

736
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,060
What's wrong with you?

737
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,660
Li Dawei.

738
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
Calm down.

739
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,580
OK?

740
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I'm going back to my room.

741
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,780
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him be impulsive.

742
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,380
What's wrong?

743
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
Is everything okay?

744
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,740
You just sleep.

745
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,260
Are you really okay?

746
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,620
Go to sleep.

747
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,910
I'll sleep more then.

748
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,990
Dawei. Dawei.

749
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,050
Xia Jie, Dawei is out.

750
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,140
What happened?

751
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,820
What happened?

752
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,160
Follow her. Let's go.

753
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,410
Where are you going?

754
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,340
Xia Jie.

755
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,790
What happened?

756
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Drive my car. I'll get the key.

757
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,860
No, I have to ask

758
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,060
what happened.

759
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,170
Li Dawei is going to make a mistake. He wants to hit someone.

760
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,700
Hit someone? Who will he hit?

761
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,990
Can you get him back first?

762
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,140
I'll tell you later.

763
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,670
Let's go.

764
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,030
Haishangluolan, what's the number?

765
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,580
Okay. Alright.

766
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,250
Keep in touch.

767
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,580
It's here.

768
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,350
Hello.

769
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,980
Hello.

770
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,340
We're policemen from the Balihe Police Station.

771
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,240
Is Mr. Yu home?

772
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,270
He went for a run at Riverside Park.

773
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,370
Thank you. Let's go.

774
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,180
What are you doing?

775
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,500
Didn't you take...

776
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,290
You...

777
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,700
We met before.

778
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,230
My name is Li Dawei.

779
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,770
I'm Chen Jiajia's brother.

780
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,020
Yes, I know.

781
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,140
Over there!

782
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,220
What happened?

783
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,810
What happened?

784
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,140
I'll teach you a lesson for Jia.

785
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,040
What are you doing?

786
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,790
Stop him!

787
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,580
What are you doing?

788
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,780
You know what you've done.

789
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,850
What did I do? Dawei.

790
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,860
Dawei, calm down.

791
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,820
Can't we talk nicely?

792
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,370
Let go of me!

793
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,210
What's wrong with you?

794
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,740
Do you know what this brute did?

795
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,580
What did I do?

796
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,860
He harassed Jia.

797
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,580
I'm warning you.

798
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,460
Don't slander me.

799
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,340
Slander you?

800
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,250
Let go of me!

801
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,620
What are you doing?

802
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,450
I haven't hit you yet. You hit me?

803
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,220
Calm down.

804
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,930
Li Dawei!

805
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,140
Police are hitting me! Stop!

806
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,910
Police are hitting me! Stop!

807
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,980
Hello.

808
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,890
The prosperous stores are for rent.

809
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,820
Would you like to take a look?

810
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,700
Thank you.

811
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,330
Sister.

812
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,700
Why are you up so early?

813
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,330
Did my thing make you unable to sleep?

814
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,970
No, Jia.

815
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,780
I got up early because I have to go to work.

816
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,180
Sit.

817
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,460
That's good.

818
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,260
Don't worry about me, sis.

819
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,220
I'm fine.

820
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,700
No way.

821
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,140
Since I know,

822
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,700
I will help you.

823
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,620
Jia.

824
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,780
Does your mother know about this thing?

825
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,100
I'm afraid to tell her.

826
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,420
You don't want her to worry.

827
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,380
And what's the use of her knowing it?

828
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,650
In front of that man,

829
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,390
she'll just submit to humiliation and smile.

830
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Even so, he always insults her.

831
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,820
Then why does your mother

832
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,290
still be with him?

833
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,610
I don't know.

834
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,340
She cried every time I asked her this.
