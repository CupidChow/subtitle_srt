Mom. Mom. Mom.

Mom! Mom! Mom!

7
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,890
What? Over here!

8
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,500
Mom!

9
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,300
Can't you see I'm dancing now?

10
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,580
You're shouting off the beat.

11
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,900
Now I'm messed up.

12
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,620
Mom.

13
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,060
-Mom. -On the beat.

14
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,980
Mom. Mom. Mom.

15
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,040
Aren't you working on the construction project?

16
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,270
Why are you acting like you're retired?

17
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,780
Don't mention it.

18
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,860
You should know.

19
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,860
Fang who I trained

20
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,340
is so good.

21
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,820
When your dad fell ill,

22
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,700
I asked him to take care of the business.

23
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,820
Then I took over again to find that

24
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,660
he managed everything well.

25
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,460
He did it better than me.

26
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,540
I thought

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,980
I might as well

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,150
give him 30% of the shares.

29
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,610
He would take care of the business.

30
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,180
Now I just listen to his reports and have fun.

31
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,740
I can still make money.

32
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,700
That's great!

33
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,260
The weather is so nice today.

34
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,100
You're having a break. I'm on leave too.

35
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,140
Let's go to the countryside resort to relax.

36
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,040
Ok...

37
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,410
To relax what?

38
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,820
Can't you see we're dancing?

39
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,690
The point is

40
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,660
we will play mahjong later.

41
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,820
Play mahjong?

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,500
Mom, you've fallen so fast.

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,420
Dancing

44
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
and playing mahjong.

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,100
Did you get this from dad?

46
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,940
Of course.

47
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,790
I think your dad's life was good.

48
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,210
Alright.

49
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,860
Anyway, can you spare one day for me?

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,500
I have a mission.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,780
What is it? What mission?

52
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,820
I'll tell you on the way.

53
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,100
No, my clothes.

54
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,820
I can't go like this.

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Mom, look at the beautiful view.

56
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,850
The air is fresh.

57
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,260
In this river,

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,540
we can even fish in summer.

59
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,220
There are countryside resorts on both sides.

60
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,420
We can find one to stay.

61
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,100
Let's kill a chicken,

62
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,300
and stew it.

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Stop.

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,980
Stop talking nonsense.

65
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,690
Tell me.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,700
What do you want?

67
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,300
I can't hide anything from you.

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,380
Stop flattering me.

69
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,580
Say it.

70
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,180
Here's the thing.

71
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,140
Soon we'll meet

72
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,020
the female officer, Xia Jie, from our station

73
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,820
and her mom.

74
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
You mission

75
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
is to make friends

76
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,980
with her mom,

77
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,260
and try to influence her.

78
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,900
Let her focus on her own life.

79
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,090
Don't always be tied up with Xia Jie.

80
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,690
Tell me.

81
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,620
What's going on between you two?

82
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:44,980
Nothing.

83
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,340
Mom, you're being so narrow-minded

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,720
and corny.

85
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,980
We're simply comrades.

86
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,659
You know me.

87
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,740
Always standing up to injustice.

88
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,060
You like her.

89
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,410
If I like her, will you help?

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,420
Of course.

91
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,140
You're overthinking too much.

92
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,780
We are just

93
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,940
simply comrades.

94
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,340
Simply comrades.

95
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,900
What is your problem?

96
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,860
You're driving the wrong way.

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,910
Xia Jie.

98
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,820
Li Dawei.

99
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,380
What a coincidence!

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,570
Auntie.

101
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,760
Hello auntie.

102
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,740
Mom.

103
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,420
Auntie, you're out with Xia Jie.

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,900
Meanwhile,

105
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,220
I'm with my mom.

106
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,450
Mom, let me introduce.

107
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,750
This is Xia Jie.

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
The comrade who joined the police with me.

109
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,250
I've been mentioning her at home.

110
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,220
Right.

111
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,420
This is her mother.

112
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,780
Auntie, this is my mom.

113
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,940
Sister.

114
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,180
If Dawei hadn't introduce you,

115
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,500
I couldn't tell.

116
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,490
I thought you were sisters.

117
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,740
Hello.

118
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,340
Hello.

119
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,220
Hello, Auntie.

120
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,100
Li Dawei often talks about you at the station.

121
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,300
In his eyes, you are a heroine.

122
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,370
We all admire you.

123
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,500
Dawei has a big mouth.

124
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,140
I don't know who he got it from.

125
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,950
Mom, you and Xia Jie

126
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,380
share the same opinion.

127
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,060
Xia Jie often said that about me at the station.

128
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,540
Auntie,

129
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
did Xia Jie also tell you about it?

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,580
Xia Jie has good manners.

131
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,630
She never gossips at home.

132
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,440
Mom.

133
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,210
Li Dawei.

134
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,100
You have a big mouth. And you're shameless.

135
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,190
Why are you messing with

136
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,390
a well mannered lady?

137
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,020
The resort.

138
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,700
Where is the resort you were talking about?

139
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,659
Let's go, shall we?

140
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,020
Mom.

141
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,740
Mom,

142
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,250
can't you consider the bigger picture?

143
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,460
Xia Jie is my colleague.

144
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,600
I reckoned her mom was your mother-in-law!

145
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,850
I've seen too many witches like her.

146
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,890
You can't be nice.

147
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,860
If you are nice to them,

148
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,060
they flatter themselves.

149
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,060
Get on the car. Let's go.

150
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,570
Jie, let's go.

151
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,580
Mom, what are you doing?

152
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,380
She greeted you with a smile.

153
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,460
You embarrassed her instead.

154
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,340
Your mom doesn't know how to please others.

155
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,620
What kind of person is Xia Jie's mom?

156
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
So corny.

157
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
Let's go.

158
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,700
Let's go.

159
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,220
Why should I help her?

160
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,780
She's hopeless.

161
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,920
Yes. Because she's hopeless,

162
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,340
we need you to step up.

163
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,020
Think about Xia Jie

164
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,980
with that mom.

165
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,860
How pitiful.

166
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,740
Pitiful Xia Jie.

167
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,460
You...

168
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
What's your relationship with her?

169
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,890
What does it have to do with me?

170
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,130
Nothing to do with you.

171
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,659
It really has something to do with me.

172
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,970
No I mean,

173
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,140
Xia Jie and I joined the police force at the same period.

174
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,039
We are partners at work.

175
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,409
Her mother is making a scene.

176
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,740
Even if it doesn't affect her job,

177
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,030
it'll affect my job.

178
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,660
Mom, give it a shot and help her.

179
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,950
Do it for your son.

180
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,440
Think of it as doing good deeds for the police.

181
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,420
Tell me.

182
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,700
What's your plan today?

183
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,940
Nothing. I don't dare to plan.

184
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,740
No plans?

185
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,060
No plans,

186
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,140
but you drove all the way to the square to find me.

187
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,290
And then took me here.

188
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,660
You didn't plan anything?

189
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,260
What plan?

190
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,510
To be honest,

191
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,420
I did discuss with Xia Jie.

192
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,020
I wanted to introduce you

193
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,300
to her mom in this way.

194
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,340
And,

195
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,110
I hope you can be friends with her.

196
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,860
Through your cheerful personality

197
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,020
and open-minded wisdom,

198
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,820
she could be influenced.

199
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,450
We really

200
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,820
didn't think it through.

201
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,740
We...

202
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
It won't happen again.

203
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,100
Stop the car.

204
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,310
Make a U-turn.

205
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,340
Mom, the atmosphere today is quite strange.

206
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,460
The atmosphere is created by people.

207
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,740
U-turn.

208
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,420
Go back.

209
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,420
Seriously?

210
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Yes.

211
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,090
Mom.

212
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,380
You did something wrong today.

213
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,420
They were so enthusiastic.

214
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,100
Look at you.

215
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,020
Enthusiastic?

216
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
Do I have to respond to

217
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,020
anyone who's enthusiastic?

218
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,900
The fraudsters who sell supplements

219
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,100
are more enthusiastic than her.

220
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,660
Calling me sister that,

221
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,820
mom that.

222
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,300
Did I pay attention to them?

223
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,650
What happened?

224
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,460
Our neighbors

225
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,540
all stocked supplements at home.

226
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,900
Look at us.

227
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,340
Can you even find one bottle?

228
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,940
You can't say that, mom.

229
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,340
Mom, they're catching up.

230
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,980
Who?

231
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,490
What are they doing?

232
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
What are they doing?

233
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,460
Drive faster. Get rid of them.

234
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,980
Drive faster, Jie!

235
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,610
No no.

236
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,340
What are you doing?

237
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,700
Don't stop.

238
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,240
Sister.

239
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,340
My son found a countryside resort nearby.

240
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,660
He wanted us to have lunch together.

241
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,740
It's just straight ahead.

242
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,820
Within a few steps.

243
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,650
Shall we go?

244
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,380
No, thank you.

245
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,970
We don't dine outside.

246
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,860
It's filthy.

247
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,130
It's filthy but you won't get sick.

248
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,780
Come. Let's go.

249
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,460
What are you doing?

250
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,180
Come on. Come on.

251
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,220
What's wrong with you?

252
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,940
Come on. Come on.

253
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,300
It's okay. Come on.

254
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,340
I said I'm not going.

255
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,780
Let's go. Come on.

256
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,820
Why won't you listen?

257
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,660
Wait a minute.

258
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,980
I'll hold it for you.

259
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,060
What's wrong with you?

260
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,100
It's okay.

261
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,140
Look.

262
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,920
Jie.

263
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,260
Look at her.

264
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,100
She's so delicate.

265
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,980
Look at your mom. I got thick skin.

266
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,100
Let me tell you.

267
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,970
My son didn't know your daughter before.

268
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,580
They knew each other after joining the police.

269
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,850
Then we knew each other.

270
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,100
-This is fate. -Jie.

271
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,700
Son. Where is it?

272
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,030
It's across the street. We're almost there.

273
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,580
I...

274
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,420
Don't...

275
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,340
Let's go. Come on.

276
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,180
It hurts.

277
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,620
Okay. Then stop struggling.

278
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,020
It won't hurt if you don't struggle.

279
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,130
Look at you and your daughter.

280
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,860
You two are like sculptures.

281
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,660
Like paintings on the wall.

282
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,980
Like models in the display window.

283
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,630
You need to be rough in life.

284
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
If you're not rough,

285
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,020
others will bully you.

286
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,260
Now you know us.

287
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,900
You know me and my son.

288
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,380
Call me if you need anything.

289
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,460
No problem.

290
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,210
Let's go.

291
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,140
Hurry up. We're here.

292
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
We're here. Let's go.

293
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,420
Your mom is amazing.

294
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,500
-Heroine. -I'll do it. I'll do it.

295
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,120
Respect.

296
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,110
Mom, thank you so much.

297
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,370
It's so suffocating.

298
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,820
Mom, you were this good today.

299
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
What are you talking about?

300
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
I did it for you.

301
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,780
Yes.

302
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,700
As for her mother.

303
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,540
Her mother.

304
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,180
Stop.

305
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,370
Look at her mother.

306
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,580
I...

307
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,650
Are you sure you want to help Xia Jie?

308
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,540
With a mother like that.

309
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
You still want to help?

310
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,460
Mom. I'm sure.

311
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,660
Fine.

312
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,500
Calm down.

313
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,890
Then I...

314
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,850
I have to find a way

315
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,530
to get her mother married soon,

316
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,340
so that she won't bother her daughter at home.

317
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,500
Mom, take it easy.

318
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,200
Xia Jie is very filial.

319
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,140
If you make her mother angry,

320
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,940
Xia Jie will turn against me.

321
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,300
Don't worry.

322
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,540
I've been doing business for so many years.

323
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,740
I've seen all kinds of people, right.

324
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,620
The dinner is on you.

325
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,770
I need to make a plan.

326
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,780
You need a plan for this?

327
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Of course.

328
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,020
I need a KPI.

329
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,700
What?

330
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,940
What's the matter, handsome?

331
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,020
You don't know.

332
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,580
You're a police officer now.

333
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,800
You better study.

334
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,070
Or else you'll fall behind.

335
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,740
Let's tone it down a bit.

336
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,940
Don't worry handsome.

337
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,500
Within one month,

338
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,140
I will give you a woman

339
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,260
who is down to earth.

340
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,900
Correction.

341
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,180
Within one month, I will give you

342
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,640
an old woman who is down to earth.

343
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,060
Isn't it the same?

344
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,540
They're all women.

345
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,900
Mom, where are you going?

346
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,540
KPI.

347
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,180
We'll have chicken tonight, mom.

348
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Suit yourself.

349
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,780
Jie's mom.

350
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,340
Jie's mom.

351
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,100
Sister.

352
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,850
Sister.

353
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,860
Jie's mom.

354
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,260
I am you sister.

355
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,500
Sister.

356
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,740
Boring.

357
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,180
This person.

358
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,820
Sister.

359
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,020
Jie's mom.

360
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm your sister.

361
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,730
My sister?

362
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,740
Don't flatter yourself.

363
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,940
Sister. Sister.

364
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,540
Sister.

365
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,740
Sister.

366
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,120
What are you doing?

367
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,880
I'm so sorry.

368
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,010
My sister.

369
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,250
My sister threw a tantrum at me.

370
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,100
She won't open the door.

371
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
But I'm worried.

372
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,780
I have to break open the door.

373
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,820
I'm sorry.

374
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,100
Sister.

375
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,470
How annoying.

376
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,580
Sister.

377
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,350
Xia Jie's mom. Are you at home?

378
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,220
Open the door.

379
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,620
It'll affect everyone.

380
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,700
Xia Jie's mom. Xia Jie's mom.

381
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,890
Are you done?

382
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,700
Sister.

383
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,330
Sister, I'm sorry.

384
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,140
Sorry for bothering you.

385
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,770
It's okay.

386
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,980
Thank you. It's okay.

387
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
Mrs. Li, what are you doing?

388
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,970
Sister, let's play mahjong.

389
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,860
We're counting on you.

390
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,460
Let's go.

391
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,380
I'm not interested in that stuff.

393
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,740
It'll be fun after you get the hang of it.

394
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,620
Hurry. Let's go.

395
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,310
I'm still in my slippers.

396
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,060
You don't need shoes.

397
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,700
I'll drive you there. Let's go.

398
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,860
You're driving?

399
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,340
Yes. What else did you think?

400
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,100
I run a business.

401
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,060
I have to drive by myself everywhere.

402
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,900
How can I not know driving?

403
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,380
Come on.

404
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,460
It's not about knowing how to drive.

405
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,980
If you drive, I don't dare to ride.

406
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,000
I dare to drive. Why not?

407
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,980
Hurry. Let's go.

408
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,020
Come on.

409
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,710
Don't drag me. I can walk by myself.

410
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,660
It's okay. Take your time.

411
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,460
Let's walk slowly.

412
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,190
-What's the matter? -Umbrella.

413
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,760
It's so sunny.

414
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
No wonder your skin is so nice.

415
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,780
So delicate.

416
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,500
I'm not like that.

417
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,340
I usually...

418
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,380
Jie's mom, are you going out?

419
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,770
Yes, we're going out.

420
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,220
I'm her sister.

421
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,680
Okay. Bye bye.

422
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,880
Bye bye.

423
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,540
Let's go.

424
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,540
Hurry. We're here.

425
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,339
The car is parked over there. Let's go.

426
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,700
I said I didn't want to come.

427
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,119
You have to go. It'll be fun.

428
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,050
We're here.

429
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,220
This one.

430
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,980
Cool, right?

431
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,340
Is it your car?

432
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,940
Yes.

433
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,500
It's very useful.

434
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,300
I have to drive around

435
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,500
several construction sites.

436
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,980
I can also deliver goods at the back.

437
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,140
It doesn't look big,

438
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,200
but it can carry a ton of goods.

439
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,780
How can I sit in it?

440
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,820
I haven't ever taken a car like this.

441
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,650
Sister. Sister.

442
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,740
Sister. Listen to me.

443
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,700
It's nice. Seriously.

444
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,620
Listen to me.

445
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,650
Listen.

446
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,620
This car is...

447
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,580
with real leather seats.

448
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,740
It's really comfortable.

449
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,580
Try it.

450
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,060
If it's not comfortable, then you can get off.

451
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,940
Now put away the umbrella.

452
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,770
Come on.

453
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,620
Slowly. Slowly.

454
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,580
Mind your head.

455
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,300
Slowly.

456
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,020
Okay. Now the legs.

457
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,620
Seat belts.

458
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,140
Great!

459
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,740
Here we are.

460
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,420
Look. It's good.

461
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,580
It's vibrant and exciting.

462
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,300
What are they doing?

463
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,300
It's a place for everyone to have fun.

464
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,220
Dancing. Playing cards. All here.

465
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,980
Okay.

466
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,580
Full of nonsense.

467
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,540
Sister. Sister. Sister.

468
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,540
Let's play for a minute.

469
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,100
Just a minute.

470
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,820
How could you

471
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,770
bring me here?

472
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,020
It's a great place. See.

473
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,700
Everyone is happy playing cards.

474
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,930
Really nice.

475
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,490
Over there.

476
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,660
It's where

477
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,130
we usually play.

478
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,000
You know.

479
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,540
Friends.

480
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,300
Friends.

481
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,890
Dawei's mom. You're here.

482
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,710
I'm sorry. Dashun's mom.

483
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,060
Are you a bit tired?

484
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,020
Can we have a go?

485
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,060
Sure. Come on.

486
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Your turn. Your turn.

487
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,900
Listen to me.

488
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,700
Listen to me.

489
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,740
Let me tell you, sister.

490
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,400
It's really really fun.

491
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,260
Seriously.

492
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,620
How could I play this

493
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,020
-with you here? -Listen.

494
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,660
It's okay.

495
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,170
It's okay. I'll teach you.

496
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,100
I'll teach you.

497
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,820
Everybody, listen.

498
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,020
My sister and I

499
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,580
are all mothers of police officers.

500
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,860
We cannot bet money.

501
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,140
With money, it'll be gambling.

502
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,100
Come on. Dawei's mom.

503
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,780
When did we ever play with money?

504
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,500
Yes. We never did.

505
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,660
Come on.

506
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,060
I really don't want to play.

507
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,940
Just for a while.

508
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,500
Try it. If it's not fun, then we can go back.

509
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,660
Come on. Dawei's mom.

510
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,970
Sit here and play cards.

511
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,100
Pick up a tile.

512
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,220
Throw the dice.

513
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,120
Let me show you.

514
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,120
I tell you.

515
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,380
His mom is a peasant.

516
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,780
Very tacky. Very boring.

517
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,370
I tell you. I've never seen

518
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
such a pretentious witch.

519
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,660
In my lifetime,

520
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,780
I've never seen such a pretentious old woman.

521
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,590
Okay.

522
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,500
Who does she think she is?

523
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,140
She thinks...

524
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,540
She thinks she's privileged.

525
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,140
See. I can do the same.

526
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,220
Who doesn't?

527
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,860
Do you know what she wanted me to do?

528
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,490
She actually asked me

529
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,260
to do bookkeeping for her construction project.

530
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,140
How dare she?

531
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,180
Dachun's mom

532
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,250
was nice to joke with her.

533
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,590
And then

534
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,500
she immediately frowned.

535
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,020
She didn't save any face.

536
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,060
I was so mad

537
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,650
that I slapped her.

538
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,090
Mom, did you really do it?

539
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,100
I...

540
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,810
Of course, I didn't.

541
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,530
That's what I had in mind, you know?

542
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,060
In my whole life,

543
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,140
I have been proud.

544
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,740
She asked me

545
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,620
to do bookkeeping for a construction leader.

546
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,340
Li Dawei.

547
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,410
I'm officially informing you

548
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,380
I quit.

549
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,620
I can't take it anymore.

550
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,810
Tell that guy

551
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,540
I don't know his mother.

552
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,460
Don't let his mother bother me again.

553
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,740
Let me make an analogy.

554
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,300
If I'm a man,

555
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,700
and all the women on Earth died,

556
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,900
I don't even want her mom.

557
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,850
Mom, look at you.

558
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,940
Have some soup.

559
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,570
Don't bother.

560
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,550
Have some.

561
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,490
Don't flatter me.

562
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,780
The chicken soup is so good. See.

563
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,420
I know.

564
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,300
It's so rich.

565
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,380
I cooked it myself.

566
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,330
Of course.

567
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,320
Why won't you eat?

568
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,070
I'm eating.

569
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,060
It's really delicious.

570
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,300
See.

571
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,380
My mom was mad, bursting into tears.

572
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
How did you mom bully my mom?

573
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,490
My mom was so pissed that her liver hurt.

574
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,890
Our moms didn't fight, did they?

575
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,620
No, they didn't.

576
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,020
Let me tell you..

577
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,590
Fighting and scolding mean love.

578
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,170
Although they sounded so harsh,

579
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,740
in fact they really enjoyed

580
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,980
each others' company.

581
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,530
What are you chatting? So happy.

582
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,300
Family matters.

583
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,660
Xia Jie.

584
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,220
I heard ever since your mom got back,

585
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,140
things got a little different.

586
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,700
How different?

587
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,220
My mom stopped calling you.

588
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,090
That counts.

589
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:56,960
Hello.

590
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,260
What's the matter?

591
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,330
What?

592
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,820
The Second Hospital.

593
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,910
Okay. I'll arrange it now.

594
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,860
Violent act at the Second Hospital.

595
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,250
A patient stabbed the doctor.

596
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,960
Let's go.

597
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,910
Okay. I'll go.

598
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,590
Master, I'll go too.

599
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,740
It's too dangerous. You...

600
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,590
Okay. Let's go.

601
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,280
Thank you master.

602
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,580
Dawei, let's go.

603
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,500
Yin! Yin!

604
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,180
So many people.

605
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,180
What happened?

606
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,160
A patient stabbed the doctor at the Second Hospital.

607
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,570
Medical dispute.

608
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,860
Which Second Hospital?

609
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,260
The one in our district.

610
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,980
Hurry. Get me a car.

611
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,260
Stand back!

612
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Stand back!

613
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,900
Ask Ma to come out!

614
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
Ask Ma to come out!

615
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,270
Make way!

616
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,100
Excuse me!

617
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,220
Step aside!

618
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,680
Excuse me!

619
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,860
Back off! Back off!

620
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,960
Don't come over!

621
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:30,930
Stay back!

622
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,680
Step back.

623
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,760
Calm down.

624
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,390
Don't come over.

625
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,470
Put the knife down, you hear me?

626
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,470
Don't come any closer!

627
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,780
Or else I'll kill her!

628
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,310
We're Balihe Police.

629
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,940
We're here to solve your problem.

630
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,860
Don't come over!

631
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,070
Calm down.

632
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,670
Don't come any closer!

633
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,760
Put the knife down, okay?

634
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,450
We're the police from Balihe Station.

635
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,850
Get out of my way!

636
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,310
Everybody calm down.

637
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,140
Back off!

638
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,710
Back off!

639
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:52,970
Calm down.

640
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,180
Calm down.

641
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,530
We're here to help you solve the problem.

642
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,660
Trust me.

643
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,660
Put the knife down.

644
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,330
Let's talk.

645
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,460
Put the knife down.

646
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,120
Don't come over!

647
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,490
Get Ma over here!

648
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,400
He's the one I want to kill!

649
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,310
Okay, we won't come over.

650
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,860
Don't move!

651
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,810
But calm down.

652
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,490
Don't move!

653
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,210
Don't hurt the innocent.

654
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,860
I didn't want to kill him.

655
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,180
-Don't come over! -Dawei.

656
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,040
Everyone, step back.

657
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,050
Get out of my way!

658
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,020
Calm down.

659
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,130
I tell you.

660
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,170
-I didn't want to kill him. -You can't make the same mistake again.

661
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,890
You don't want your child to be an orphan.

662
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,150
-I didn't want to kill him. -You're a father now.

663
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,330
You are the only family to your child.

664
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,620
Jie.

665
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,430
You lost your father.

666
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,790
Get Ma over here!

667
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,260
I will kill him!

668
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,500
Don't come over!

669
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,420
I don't believe in you.

670
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,100
Calm down. Put the knife down.

671
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:55,930
Put down the knife.)

672
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,260
You still have a chance.

673
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,220
But you can't make any more mistakes.

674
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,270
Your child needs you.

675
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,620
Chief!

676
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,260
Xincheng.

677
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,580
Chief, you're here.

678
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,420
Who got stabbed?

679
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,530
Someone named Zhuo.

680
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,580
What's wrong?

681
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,220
Zhuo...

682
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,100
Chief!

683
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,500
Blood. Get more blood!

684
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,700
Doctor! Doctor!

685
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,540
Who got stabbed?

686
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,530
Surgeon Dr. Zhuo Liming.

687
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,260
Let go!

688
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,700
Here's the blood.

689
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,450
Excuse me.

690
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,530
No, no, no.

691
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,970
He's my friend. He's my friend.

692
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,970
Let me in!

693
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,000
Let me in!

694
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,780
He is my friend. He is my...

695
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,650
Dr. Zhuo!

696
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,290
CPR.

697
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,100
Continue AED.

698
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:16,810
Chief!

699
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,900
Calm down!

700
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,290
Heart beat.

701
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,250
Old buddy.

702
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,740
Why are you here?

703
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,900
How is he?

704
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,340
Quickly save him!

705
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,180
Why are you here?

706
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,980
Go save him!

707
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,700
I wanted to save him. I really do.

708
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,650
I respected him the most.

709
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,660
Save him!

710
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,340
Why are you crying?

711
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,330
I can't.

712
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,900
What did you say?

713
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,880
Chief! Chief!

714
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,470
Go save him! Save him!

715
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,340
Why did our country support you for so many years?

716
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:40,940
Chief!

717
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,620
Snap out of it!

718
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,220
Chief!

719
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,940
Isn't he the one you respected the most?

720
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,370
You must save him!

721
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,240
Chief!

722
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,260
Quick!

723
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:49,930
Chief.

724
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,500
Calm down!

725
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,550
That man didn't even know Dr. Zhuo.

726
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,190
When his wife was giving birth,

727
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,810
she died of amniotic fluid embolism.

728
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,140
He couldn't take it.

729
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,490
He stormed into the O&G with a knife.

730
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,870
He almost attacked a nurse.

731
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,470
He went insane.

732
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,750
Dr. Zhuo was passing by,

733
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,790
so he stood up against him in the critical situation.

734
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,730
And

735
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,730
he was stabbed 17 times.

736
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,290
Chief.

737
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,540
I'm so sorry.

738
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,930
When you are free,

739
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,110
and I am free,

740
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,780
let's sit down,

741
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,740
and have a drink.

742
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,370
Let's talk about the life and world.

743
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,350
Maybe we have lots of common languages.

744
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,380
Old buddy.

745
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,250
Life is unpredictable.

746
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,220
When you can do nothing,

747
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,100
just let it go.

748
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,220
We are both making the world a better place.

749
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,310
We share the same goal.

750
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,900
Xia Jie.

751
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,610
Xia Jie.

752
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,700
Xia Jie.

753
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,460
Xia Jie.

754
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,250
What?

755
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,540
Are you okay, Xia Jie?

756
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,060
Yes, I'm fine.

757
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,750
If you're okay,

758
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,140
come and sit outside.

759
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,220
Zhao Jiwei says he's lonely.

760
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,130
I want to lie down for a while.

761
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,140
I'm not lonely.

762
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,860
I...

763
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,740
I want to have some noodles. Do you want some?

764
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,180
No thanks. You go ahead.

765
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,050
Um...

766
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
Dawei says he wants you to cook some.

767
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,580
Hello. Instructor.

768
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,860
Dawei.

769
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,780
I want to ask

770
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,770
do you know where Xia Jie is.

771
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,780
I know.

772
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,940
She's in her room.

773
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,100
In her room.

774
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,460
Great! Great!

775
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,500
You should know.

776
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,860
Wait a sec.

777
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,740
You should know.

778
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,660
Her mother has been calling her.

779
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,220
Xia Jie can't reach her so her mom's very worried.

780
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,700
She's been calling me.

781
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
You ask Xia Jie to call

782
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,140
her mother back right now.

783
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,540
Okay.

784
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,260
Xia Jie.

785
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,660
The instructor asked you to call your mom.

786
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,730
She has been looking for you.

787
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,980
Xia...Xia Jie.

788
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,370
You aren't ill, are you?

789
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,420
I'm going in if you don't open your door.

790
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,490
It's locked.

791
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,100
Xia Jie.

792
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,300
Can't you leave me alone?

793
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,740
No. The instructor is looking for you.

794
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,860
She asked you to call your mom.

795
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,060
I'll call her now, okay?

796
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,260
My phone died just now.

797
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,490
Open the door.

798
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,820
Let us see how you are now.

799
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,360
Xia Jie, Xia Jie, Xia Jie.

800
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,510
You two are really annoying, you know?

801
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,420
I know.

802
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,020
Your OCD care

803
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,219
stresses me a lot.

804
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,100
All right.

805
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,179
Leave her alone.

806
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,580
Qizi.

807
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,540
We're on duty.

808
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,540
Why are you always asking me?

809
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,139
Can you find somebody else?

810
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,100
I'll take it. I'll take it.

811
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,620
Where is it?

812
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,460
Jinbao Street.

813
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,300
Mind your own business.

814
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Guohao. On duty.

815
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,670
Auntie is here. She's at the service center.

816
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,790
Auntie, here's some water.

817
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,900
Xia Jie.

818
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,580
Mom, why are you here?

819
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,700
Why am I here?

820
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,770
You're asking me.

821
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,100
I was worried to death.

822
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,300
I couldn't sleep all night.

823
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,420
Keep it down.

824
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,530
I told you

825
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,660
I would come home tonight.

826
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,090
What about yesterday?

827
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,500
What happened yesterday?

828
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,570
Let's go out.

829
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,540
Let's go out and talk.

830
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,110
Do you know what I

831
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,900
went through last night?

832
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,580
Chief Cheng.

833
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,900
Chief Gao.

834
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,140
Where's the chief?

835
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,290
He's not here.

836
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,700
What time is it?

837
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,980
He's never late to work.

838
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,490
I knocked for a while but nobody answered.

839
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,740
His car is not here too.

840
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,460
Maybe he went for a waist check-up.

841
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,230
His waist?

842
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,340
Don't you know?

843
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,580
The doctor who died yesterday

844
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,880
was the chief's friend.

845
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
It's the one who treated his waist.

846
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,460
It didn't occur to me.

847
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,820
I'll give him a call.

848
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,420
Nobody answered.

849
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,940
He shouldn't go missing.

850
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,260
Nonsense.

851
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,780
Find the instructor.

852
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,350
Instructor.

853
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,380
I was looking for you.

854
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,100
The bureau just called.

855
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,340
The chief will take his leave for two days.

856
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,530
Take his leave.

857
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,340
He didn't tell us.

858
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,260
It's not like him.

859
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,060
I'm on leave for two days.

860
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,080
If there's anything,

861
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,540
you can take care of it.

862
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,080
Don't reply.

863
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,480
What is he doing?

864
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,090
It must be

865
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,780
that his doctor friend died,

866
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,200
so he couldn't take it.

867
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,530
He couldn't overcome the obstacle.

868
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,300
It's impossible.

869
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,010
He has witnessed many accidents.

870
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,260
All right.

871
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,070
Enough of the speculation.

872
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,850
Let's discuss

873
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,960
the work arrangement

874
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,500
during chief's absence.

875
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,580
Let's divide the workload.

876
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,710
Divide the workload?

877
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,020
Instructor, you take the lead.

878
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,010
We are in charge of what we're supposed to do.

879
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,600
The chief is absent just for two days.

880
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,740
No. It's easy for you to say.

881
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,580
The chief is in charge of the whole situation

882
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,860
and the community.

883
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,720
That's so complicated.

884
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,460
The instructor at the station

885
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,340
has a lot of work to do.

886
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,580
She also has to balance her family.

887
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,460
Her parents and children must be looked after.

888
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,430
Don't burden her anymore.

889
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,380
Chief Cheng. It's your job.

890
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,770
No. I...

891
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,340
I suggest

892
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,620
the instructor

893
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,840
is responsible for the whole situation.

894
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,800
I'll assist you.

895
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,050
You are young and strong.

896
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,590
You''ll be temporarily in charge of the community.

897
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,020
Good idea.

898
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,850
No problem.

899
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,860
-Chief. -It's a deal.

900
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,810
Chief!

901
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,580
Why are you shouting?

902
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,290
What's wrong?

903
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,060
What happened?

904
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,430
Xia Jie got into a fight with her mom.

905
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,060
What?

906
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,810
No.

907
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,470
Xia Jie's mom wants to go to the police station.

908
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,590
Xia Jie wouldn't let her.

909
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,010
-Where? -Where are they?

910
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,860
Right outside the gate.

911
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,780
Let's go and have a look.

912
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:21,940
Let's go.

913
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,210
I'm not leaving. I need to see him.

914
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:23,780
Let's talk at home.

915
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,320
Auntie, let's talk inside.

916
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,000
Mrs. Xia.

917
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,790
Okay. I need to see Wang Shouyi.

918
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,540
Li Dawei. Stop causing trouble.

919
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,960
What trouble?

920
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,530
You won't let me see Wang Shouyi.

921
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,810
Li Dawei is taking me to see him.

922
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,510
Stop embarrassing me, okay?

923
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,730
Dawei.

924
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,090
You should let Xia Jie handle it.

925
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:41,920
Let's go home.

926
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,490
No.

927
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,440
-Let's go home. -Let go.

928
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Let's talk at home.

929
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,250
My sister.

930
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,840
What's wrong?

931
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,410
Tell me what's the matter. It's the same.

932
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,510
Who's your sister?

933
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:56,740
Where's Wang Shouyi?

934
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,500
The chief is on leave.

935
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,460
Where's Cheng Hao?

936
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,370
He's her master and deputy chief.

937
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,430
Where is he hiding?

938
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,420
Madam. Madam.

939
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,580
I'm not hiding.

940
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,820
According to the order,

941
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,450
if the chief is on leave, the instructor is in charge.

942
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,870
I have to ask you.

943
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,930
What did you and Wang Shouyi promise me at first?

944
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Mrs. Xia, don't be angry.

945
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,890
I am deputy chief Gao Chao.

946
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,490
Stop looking.

947
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,720
Our chief is really on leave.

948
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,130
We can't contact him either.

949
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,500
If you have any needs,

950
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,670
let's talk inside.

951
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,100
Yes. Let's go.

952
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,160
Let's talk inside.

953
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,740
Come on.

954
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,630
Don't be angry.

955
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,390
We can talk this out.

956
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,390
Xia Jie, wait a minute.

957
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,300
Xincheng. You're on duty.

958
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,140
Yes.

959
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,760
Take Xia Jie with you.

960
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,220
Xia Jie, go with them.

961
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,750
Okay.

962
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,570
Let's go, Xia Jie.

963
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,610
Let's go.

964
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,490
It's my daughter. How can I not be mad?

965
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,460
Don't be angry.

966
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,980
If you have anything to say,

967
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,370
come talk in my office.

968
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,450
Mrs. Xia.

969
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,580
What...

970
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,270
Mrs. Xia...

971
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,360
-What are you looking? Mind your own business. -What's wrong?

972
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,160
Don't cry.

973
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,980
Mrs. Xia.

974
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,940
Mrs. Xia.

975
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,290
Here.

976
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,660
Here.

977
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,070
Don't cry.

978
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Take a sit please.

979
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,760
Take your time to talk.

980
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,360
If you cry,

981
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,990
we all feel

982
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,390
quite miserable.

983
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,350
Get some water.

984
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,040
Mrs. Xia.

985
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,580
If you have anything to say, just tell us.

986
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,990
Don't cry. Don't cry.

987
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,180
Here.

988
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,700
Have a sip of water.

989
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,530
Feel free to talk.

990
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,780
What does Wang Shouyi mean?

991
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,690
What do you mean?

992
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,690
My husband

993
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,580
already sacrificed himself for the Balihe police.

994
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,070
Do you want Xia Jie to sacrifice herself too?

995
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,140
If anything happens to her,

996
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,060
how can I live?

997
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,410
Madam, don't get anxious.

998
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,240
Actually,

999
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,240
I didn't understand what you mean.

1000
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,020
We'll correct it if we have done anything wrong.

1001
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,860
Nobody asked Xia Jie to sacrifice herself.

1002
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,880
You're lying.

1003
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,260
Wang Shouyi lied to me.

1004
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,720
Cheng Hao, you lied to me.

1005
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,060
Now Xia Jie is also lying to me.

1006
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,070
I didn't.

1007
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,900
Nonsense.

1008
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,810
What did you do yesterday?

1009
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,610
Xia Jie's father already died.

1010
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,710
You still asked her to go to such a dangerous place.

1011
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,780
Madam, I understand what you're talking about.

1012
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,930
Yesterday,

1013
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,980
we were quite worried at first.

1014
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,090
But

1015
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,550
there were so many people by her side protecting her.

1016
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,180
Nothing could go wrong.

1017
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,380
More importantly,

1018
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,500
I recently promised Jie

1019
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,950
not to be overprotective to her.

1020
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,410
Overprotective?

1021
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,830
Well...

1022
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,980
You should know that,

1023
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,700
after the incident of Jie's father,

1024
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,140
Jie faints every time she sees blood.

1025
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,780
Jie is really persistent.

1026
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,440
She doesn't want privilege.

1027
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,110
If I hadn't asked her,

1028
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,790
she would never tell me.

1029
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,820
This is not privilege.

1030
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,780
This is a matter of reality.

1031
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,270
If she had fainted,

1032
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,130
and lost consciousness,

1033
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,090
falling in front of the criminal,

1034
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,010
her life would be at risk.
