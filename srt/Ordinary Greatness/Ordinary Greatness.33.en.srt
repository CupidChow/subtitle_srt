5
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:40,690
Chief Zhou.

6
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,620
Well, 70...

7
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,940
15 or 16 years ago,

8
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,460
it shouldn't be the age of retirement.

9
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,580
At that time,

10
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,650
there was an incident at the police station,

11
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,180
so I took early retirement.

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,140
What is it?

13
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,030
Well...

14
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,340
Here, eat more.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,040
Eat it while it's hot.

16
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,120
Eat more while it's hot.

17
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,580
Anyway,

18
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,020
I took early retirement.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
He quit not long

20
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,620
after I retired.

21
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,560
Before he left, he came to say goodbye to me

22
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,420
and brought me some bacon.

23
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,730
Have you heard from him

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,150
since he left?

25
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,780
No.

26
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,340
In all these years,

27
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,620
we've never spoken.

28
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,430
Chief,

29
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,810
when Yue Wei was at the police station,

30
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,570
did you notice anything unusual about him?

31
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,850
I didn't feel that.

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,120
But this kid

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,360
was very meticulous.

34
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,570
He got along with everyone at the station.

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,750
But he's not too close to anyone,

36
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,400
including me.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,450
Chief, may I ask you something?

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,050
Has he

39
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,490
ever done anything

40
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,760
with women around here?

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,730
Women? What shall I say?

42
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,340
Catch a cold?

43
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,980
Have a cold?

44
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,620
Honey,

45
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,810
get him some medicine.

46
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,700
I'm fine. I'm fine.

47
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,500
Go on.

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,240
Go ahead. Go ahead.

49
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,270
How shall I put this...

50
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,250
When he worked here,

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,220
he couldn't

52
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,020
find a good match.

53
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
He was unwilling to

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,740
marry a country woman.

55
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,540
But the city people

56
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,850
despised him

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,540
because he was only an auxiliary policeman.

58
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,140
Catch a cold?

59
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,700
Take some medicine and you'll be fine.

60
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,370
Thank you. Thank you.

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,100
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

62
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,780
You're welcome.

63
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,820
By the way,

64
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,060
I wonder if he left the station

65
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,579
because of that.

66
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,780
-What is it? 
-What is it?

67
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,930
This is a wooded area.

68
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,410
There're more men than women.

69
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,340
Some people

70
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,010
sold sex

71
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,100
on the hills.

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,420
Once I dealt with

73
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,460
a couple of women who went up the mountain for prostitution.

74
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,980
I let them go

75
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,820
after a few days.

76
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,460
And a few days later,

77
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,140
a woman came over.

78
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,700
She said

79
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,980
Yue Wei went to her place.

80
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,300
He threatened her

81
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,220
with prostitution

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,310
and raped her.

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,910
This was a very serious matter.

84
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,740
So I went to talk to Yue Wei about it.

85
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,220
He insisted that

86
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,060
he had feelings for her and she was willing.

87
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,330
That woman had no evidence.

88
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,580
And the police station didn't want the story to go public.

89
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,140
So this matter

90
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,100
was put to one side.

91
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,780
Anyway,

92
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,409
this woman was

93
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,250
the target of our crackdown.

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,370
Whether you had evidence or not,

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,180
it was a mistake

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,020
for Yue Wei to have such an illicit relationship

97
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,260
with this woman.

98
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,460
Therefore,

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
the police station gave him a serious warning.

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,940
Then I retired.

101
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,740
Before long,

102
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,140
he quit, too.

103
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,820
Chief Zhou.

104
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,330
Sorry, Chief Zhou.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,420
It's our chief.

106
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,700
I'm gonna take this.

107
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,120
Hello, Chief.

108
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,980
I'll have a drink with you.

109
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,620
Eat more.

110
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,700
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

111
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,420
I can't hear you.

112
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,210
Wait.

113
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,930
Go ahead, go ahead. What is it?

114
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,300
Yes, I can hear you.

115
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,980
Yue Wei may have gone home.

116
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,659
This was the word from the vice squad.

117
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,770
They've been spying on him.

118
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,140
Captain Luo called me just now.

119
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,290
He said

120
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,140
Yue Wei drove out of town today.

121
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,490
He got on the highway and headed northeast.

122
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,860
He might have gone home.

123
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,380
Okay, okay, okay. I got it.

124
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,780
Well,

125
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,159
we're chatting with

126
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,960
the former chief of the police station

127
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,880
where he used to work.

128
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,240
If he does come back,

129
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,620
we might have to stay a few more days.

130
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:01,620
Okay.

131
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,520
Chief, say happy new year to Mrs. Wang for me.

132
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,620
Who is it?

133
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,420
Zhou Hui.

134
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,260
Mrs. Cao.

135
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,210
Chief Wang. Chief Cheng.

136
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,180
What are you doing here?

137
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,700
The Spring Festival is coming,

138
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,820
so we come to see you.

139
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,659
Chief Wang, I'm good with the kid.

140
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,850
There's no man in the house now.

141
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,600
It's not convenient.

142
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,220
So I won't invite you in.

143
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,970
Look at you.

144
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,460
We are not outsiders.

145
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,100
Yes.

146
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,370
We want to go inside.

147
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,220
Chief Wang,

148
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,940
Jianjun is not a cop anymore.

149
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,750
He has nothing to do with you.

150
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,820
What are you doing here?

151
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,500
Zhou Hui,

152
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,170
didn't I tell you?

153
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,270
Although Jianjun is not a police officer anymore,

154
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,690
in our hearts,

155
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,700
he will always be one of us.

156
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,700
The Spring Festival is coming.

157
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,100
So we come to see you

158
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,380
and Yaya.

159
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,820
I don't need your pity.

160
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,980
Mrs. Cao,

161
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,610
how could you say that?

162
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,730
We don't pity you.

163
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,409
We just came to see you on behalf of Jianjun.

164
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,420
You don't want to let us in

165
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,740
because we bring so few things?

166
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,300
Come in, please.

167
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,940
Yaya, come here, come here, come here.

168
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,930
Give me a hug.

169
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,500
-Yaya.
-Hello, hello.

170
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,020
You must have grown tall.

171
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,860
Good, good.

172
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,370
Here, Yaya.

173
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,210
Take this.

174
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,420
No, she can't take this.

175
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,660
Why not?

176
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,170
I'm her uncle.

177
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,620
This is the lucky money I gave her.

178
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,820
I hope she can grow up happily.

179
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,860
Just take it.

180
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,180
This is a blessing for the child.

181
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,140
Thank uncle.

182
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,390
Okay.

183
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,260
Thank you, uncle.

184
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,760
Yaya, this is from Uncle Cheng.

185
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,500
I wish you more and more beautiful

186
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,780
and become happier in the new year.

187
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,850
Take it.

188
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,710
Thank Uncle Cheng.

189
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,900
Thank you, Uncle Cheng.

190
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,880
You're welcome.

191
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,740
Happy new year.

192
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,700
Thank you.

193
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,860
By the way, Zhou Hui,

194
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,130
I was wondering

195
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,830
if you could let Yaya in to watch TV for a while.

196
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,380
Yaya, go inside and play by yourself.

197
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,380
Okay, see you later.

198
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,220
See you later.

199
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
This is from the station...

200
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,750
I... I really can't take this.

201
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,530
Take it. Take it.

202
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,660
Everyone has it.

203
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,540
It's new year.

204
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,500
Right, right.

205
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,860
Thank you.

206
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,610
Tomorrow will be Chinese New Year's Eve.

207
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,620
What are your plans?

208
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,370
I'll spend the holidays with my child.

209
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,740
Zhou Hui,

210
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,850
I know, because of Jianjun,

211
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,600
you and your mom got a little...

212
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,330
But it's still your family.

213
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,450
You might as well go back.

214
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,020
No.

215
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
I'm fine with the kid.

216
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,140
All right.

217
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,140
I'll send a car to pick you up tomorrow afternoon.

218
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,410
Here's the thing.

219
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,780
Some comrades in the police station

220
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,380
are on a business trip.

221
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,420
They won't be back until tomorrow night.

222
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,660
So we decided to

223
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,900
take their families

224
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,340
to the police station

225
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,900
to make dumplings and celebrate the New Year's Eve together.

226
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,420
I'm not going.

227
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,100
I can't hold my head up

228
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,700
when I see them.

229
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,250
Zhou Hui, I'm going to criticize you.

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,160
Do you think we all

231
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,470
despise you?

232
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,980
You can't think like that.

233
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,100
You're fine,

234
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,780
but you need to think about Yaya.

235
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,380
For the sake of your child,

236
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,250
go to the police station tomorrow night for the New Year's Eve, okay?

237
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,700
We'll have a good time together.

238
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,540
There're fireworks.

239
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
It's a bit like Chinese New Year.

240
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,940
Here.

241
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,740
This pavilion.

242
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,110
We'll all gather here in a minute.

243
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,260
Did you all remember

244
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,020
the license plate he used?

245
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,860
-Yes.
-Yes.

246
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,220
I saw

247
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,300
them all parked outside.

248
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,500
I don't think he's gonna change his number when he gets back.

249
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,500
If you don't find the license plate,

250
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,610
just take a look at

251
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,700
his front windshield, okay?

252
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,210
Okay.

253
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,500
If you find it, don't disturb him.

254
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,180
Report back to me.

255
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,520
Go ahead.

256
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,900
Let’s go.

257
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,280
[29th Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month]

258
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,360
[New Year's Eve]

259
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,860
Master, this car is so cheap.

260
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
It costs only 200 yuan a day.

261
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,980
We don't have this kind of price on our end.

262
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,360
Cheap means the economy is bad here.

263
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,940
You still have a cold?

264
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,250
I'll go to the drugstore up front

265
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,330
and get you some cold medicine.

266
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,340
Did you buy anything else?

267
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,260
Yue Wei has seen us before.

268
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,860
Yes. They're in the back.

269
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,130
This?

270
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,840
Eat.

271
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,380
We'll keep looking this afternoon.

272
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,460
He must be in this area. He can't get away.

273
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,060
He must be at home during the Spring Festival.

274
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,340
This is our best chance to catch him.

275
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,900
It is no use regretting if we miss the chance.

276
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,220
Here we go.

277
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Why is there another dish?

278
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,780
Come on, guys.

279
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,220
It's Chinese New Year and you're outside.

280
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,500
I'll add one more dish for you,

281
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,900
Braised Pork with Vermicelli.

282
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
Happy new year!

283
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:41,890
Thank you, sir.

284
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,050
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

285
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,510
Today is New Year's Eve. Why aren't there any guests?

286
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,260
You may not know,

287
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,860
it's our custom

288
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,300
to have dinner outside on New Year's Eve.

289
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,250
Check it out tonight. It's packed.

290
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,020
Reservations should be made two months in advance.

291
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
But you guys are kind of special.

292
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,260
What are you guys doing out here during the festival?

293
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,220
We have a little project

294
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,980
to finish.

295
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,340
If we're done, we're leaving today.

296
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,040
Thank you, sir. May the gold fill your pocket.

297
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,890
May the gold fill your pocket. May the gold fill your pocket.

298
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,990
Please enjoy. Please enjoy.

299
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,580
See?

300
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,980
The boss even gave us extra food.

301
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,380
I'm sure we'll find him today.

302
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,940
Eat.

303
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,410
Master.

304
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,160
Eat more.

305
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,350
Okay.

306
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,180
Master, this is the village.

307
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,530
I heard it's the third from the bottom west of the village.

308
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,530
Look, Yue Wei's car.

309
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,810
Drive over there before he sees us.

310
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,020
Put on your sunglasses

311
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,700
for camouflage.

312
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,260
Let's go ahead and find a place to hide.

313
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,220
Crouch and keep an eye on him.

314
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,970
Come on. Here.

315
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,540
Master, why did he come back

316
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,090
during the Spring Festival?

317
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,300
I don't know.

318
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,020
But,

319
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,060
there must be something wrong.

320
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,980
Maybe he found out

321
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,140
Captain Luo and the others were watching him.

322
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,220
How long has it been

323
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,480
since Liu Xiaoli last reported the crime?

324
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,860
About three months.

325
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,820
Only three months?

326
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,100
That doesn't seem likely.

327
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,860
It's said that serial killings

328
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,340
are getting more and more frequent.

329
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,460
But three months is a bit tight.

330
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,980
Master,

331
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,450
don't forget that

332
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,860
if the rape was true,

333
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,580
he only raped Liu Xiaoli last time.

334
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
He didn't do anything else.

335
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,330
You mean

336
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,020
he didn't finish the killing?

337
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,460
Is that even a possibility or not?

338
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,700
Right.

339
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,360
You know what? You keep watching.

340
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,370
I'll call Captain Luo.

341
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,850
Okay.

342
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,570
Keep an eye on it.

343
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,010
Captain Luo.

344
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,960
Chen, happy new year.

345
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,010
Happy new year. Happy new year.

346
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,900
I just want to ask you,

347
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
have there been any major cases

348
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,730
in the city recently?

349
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,380
Case?

350
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,440
Yes, it's mostly about

351
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,020
prostitutes disappearing or being killed.

352
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,670
There were two robberies and murders.

353
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,890
The cases were solved and the men were arrested.

354
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,860
Okay, okay, got it.

355
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,610
Thank you.

356
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,140
How is it?

357
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,290
Any clues?

358
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,900
No.

359
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,700
There were two robberies and murders.

360
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,410
Both cases were solved

361
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,260
and the criminals were caught.

362
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,589
Then what is he doing back here?

363
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,099
Keep watching.

364
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,420
Master, we can't

365
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,380
stay here all the time.

366
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
We're gonna freeze to death lying like this all day.

367
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,329
We can take turns.

368
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,140
You get in the car first.

369
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,540
Turn the car on and warm yourself up.

370
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,099
What if the oil dries up

371
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:22,940
and he comes out?

372
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,460
You think you're smart?

373
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,740
Don't worry.

374
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,300
Do you think I didn't think of that?

375
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,820
I went out

376
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,770
while we were having the meal.

377
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,620
I saw a gas station next to the restaurant.

378
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,770
Don't worry.

379
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,040
Our gas tank is full.

380
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,740
Good job, boy.

381
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,910
You got wiser.

382
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,950
All right, I'm gonna warm up in the car.

383
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,680
Go ahead.

384
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,250
Keep an eye on it.

385
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,910
Okay, okay.

386
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,070
Get yourself warm.

387
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,700
Ride a horse.

388
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,660
Stay safe.

389
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,320
It's a very easy way to hit your head.

390
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,140
Be careful when you play.

391
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,900
Ride it flat.

392
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,330
Watch out. Be careful of the car.

393
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,920
Are you okay?

394
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,250
I'm fine.

395
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,860
Keep an eye on your child.

396
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,190
Thank you.

397
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,860
You're welcome.

398
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,300
Keep an eye on him.

399
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,370
Mom, let's play a little longer.

400
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,430
Go home early and take care of your brother.

401
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,920
Sister.

402
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,620
Master, is that him?

403
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,260
Let's go outside.

404
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,180
Master, I remember him.

405
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,020
It must be him.

406
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,820
The license plate

407
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,140
and the cracks in the glass match up.

408
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,860
I'm sure of it.

409
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,380
I need you to call them all back.

410
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,530
It's suspicious

411
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,860
to be walking around a residential area

412
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,780
today.

413
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:14,930
Qiancheng,

414
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,760
watch that intersection

415
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,180
and see if he leaves here.

416
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,420
Maybe he came back to visit relatives.

417
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,380
Master, no one

418
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,620
would choose to visit relatives today.

419
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,900
What if...

420
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,260
What if he's not from here

421
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,320
and he came here to visit relatives?

422
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,620
If we act hastily,

423
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,020
it could lead to something else.

424
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,250
Maybe we should go to the local police station

425
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,150
and check his household registration.

426
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,540
What are you thinking?

427
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,890
Director Liu made it clear

428
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,500
he didn't want us to arrest him today.

429
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,700
What if we go there

430
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,860
and he disagrees again,

431
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,620
what are we gonna do?

432
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,620
We are not gonna catch him.

433
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,820
We just bump into him.

434
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,420
We'll talk to them

435
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,700
when we have a clear target.

436
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,500
Okay.

437
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,550
All right. Call them.

438
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,320
Chief,

439
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,290
we found

440
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,540
the target.

441
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,820
But here's a new thing.

442
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,320
Qi Bei's comrades

443
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,620
don't agree with our arrest today.

444
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,700
Why don't you talk to them?

445
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,540
Okay.

446
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,730
Okay, got it.

447
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,300
Master, I'm done.

448
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,940
You go ahead.

449
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,820
You just got back.

450
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,740
Young people are strong.

451
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,780
I just warm myself up.

452
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,580
How is it going? Any movement?

453
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,330
No, the car is still there.

454
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,140
What will we do

455
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,340
if he stays at home for New Year's Eve dinner?

456
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,900
Impossible.

457
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,470
He hasn't been back in years.

458
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,060
He will come back for a New Year's Eve dinner?

459
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,060
Liu Xiaoli?

460
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,470
How about this?

461
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,050
-You keep watching. I'll take this call.
-Okay.

462
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,560
Hello, Liu Xiaoli.

463
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,060
What’s up?

464
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
Mr. Chen.

465
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,860
Happy new year, Mr. Chen.

466
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,740
There's nothing else.

467
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,420
I just wanted to call you to say new year's greetings.

468
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,060
Happy new year. Happy new year.

469
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,100
What's the matter?

470
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,600
Mr. Chen, my dad called me home for dinner this year.

471
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,420
We're making dumplings.

472
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,740
Mr. Chen, have you had the dumplings yet?

473
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,810
Yes, yes. I'm eating dumplings.

474
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,830
That's right, Xiaoli.

475
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,680
No matter how bad it is at home,

476
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,860
it's better than being out there.

477
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Remember,

478
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,490
get along with your parents,

479
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,740
work hard and live your life well.

480
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,060
Okay, I got it.

481
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,380
Thank you.

482
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,050
Take care of yourself.

483
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,020
Okay, okay, okay.

484
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,980
Mr. Chen,

485
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,940
my mom asked me to make dumplings.

486
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,020
Bye.

487
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,940
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

488
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,660
What's the matter?

489
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:24,970
Nothing.

490
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,860
Liu Xiaoli

491
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,620
is finally on the right track.

492
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,580
Master,

493
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,920
tell me.

494
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,500
When I first saw Liu Xiaoli,

495
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,760
I thought she was full of lies.

496
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,780
How could you choose to believe her?

497
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,980
When you have your own child,

498
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,260
you'll understand.

499
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,240
There was a time

500
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,620
when Jiajia

501
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,000
thought I was her enemy.

502
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,580
I was confused.

503
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,890
I was wondering why on earth.

504
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,750
She hated me.

505
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,460
Fine, I understand.

506
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,380
But if you said she was a bad person,

507
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,860
I wouldn't believe you.

508
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,650
When I saw Liu Xiaoli,

509
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,660
I thought of Jiajia.

510
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,030
Master,

511
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,350
someone is coming out.

512
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,380
Is it Yue Wei?

513
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,060
Yes, yes, yes. It's Yue Wei.

514
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,820
It's him.

515
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,900
I'll get the car.

516
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,040
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

517
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,960
Let's watch him a little bit more.

518
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,050
Master,

519
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,830
wait, wait.

520
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,970
Let's watch him a little bit more.

521
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,530
Coming, he's coming.

522
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,350
Master.

523
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,720
Don't worry. Go get the car.

524
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,140
Don't get too close.

525
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,060
We're easy to be spotted.

526
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,110
Master, it'll be dark soon.

527
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,410
Where do you think he's driving to?

528
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,580
I don't know. Keep up with him first.

529
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,220
Okay.

530
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,490
There you are.

531
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,140
Happy new year. Happy new year. Happy new year.

532
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,940
Happy new year. Happy new year.

533
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,300
Happy new year. Happy new year.

534
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,720
Happy new year. Happy new year.

535
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,910
Mrs. Zhang, happy new year.

536
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,900
Happy new year, Mrs. Zhang.

537
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,730
Chief, happy new year.

538
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,830
Today is Chinese New Year.

539
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,140
We're sending him on a business trip,

540
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,700
so you can't be together.

541
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,820
You need to understand.

542
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,140
Zhijie always told us

543
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,220
he would put the work first.

544
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,820
We're very happy

545
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,730
to have a family reunion dinner

546
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,900
with you this year.

547
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Okay, okay, okay. All right, all right.

548
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,660
Mrs. Zhang, go inside, please.

549
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,820
Okay, we'll go in first.

550
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,620
We'll go in first.

551
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,690
-Chief Gao. -Look who's here.

552
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Let me see. My dear daughter.

553
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,220
Chief Gao's daughter is so cute.

554
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
Be careful. Don't hit the head.

555
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,620
Come on, come on, come on. Have a look.

556
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,180
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Say hello to them.

557
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,900
Uncle.

558
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,010
Auntie.

559
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,610
Auntie.

560
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,140
-Hello, auntie.
-Say happy new year.

561
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,900
Give me a hug. Give me a hug. Give me a hug.

562
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,580
Okay.

563
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,430
Happy new year. Happy new year.

564
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,250
Get in there.

565
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,070
We'll go in first.

566
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,240
Go, go, go, honey.

567
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,740
You got advanced!

568
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,620
So cute!

569
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,320
Okay, here we are. Let's get out.

570
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,010
How did the two of them

571
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
get together?

572
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,690
Chief, you're being too rigid, aren't you?

573
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,380
They are not just good friends now.

574
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,180
Besides,

575
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,940
Xia Jie's mother and Liang...

576
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,310
Maybe after Chinese New Year,

577
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,300
we'll have to help them with their wedding.

578
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,260
No, no, no. You...

579
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,020
It's Chinese New Year. Don't gossip.

580
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,900
Don't talk nonsense.

581
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,740
It's true. It's true.

582
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,140
True what?

583
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,780
Chief.

584
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,660
-Sister.
-Shouyi, happy new year.

585
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,380
Happy new year. Happy new year.

586
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,140
Happy new year. Happy new year.

587
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,020
Shouyi, happy new year.

588
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,750
Happy new year.

589
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,890
Hello, Chief Wang.

590
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,280
Today is Chinese New Year.

591
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,900
Dawei can't spend the Spring Festival at home.

592
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,140
You're on your own for the New Year.

593
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,290
Is that okay?

594
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,340
I do have a problem.

595
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,340
You're kidding me.

596
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm fine!

597
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
I spend the holiday with my sister.

598
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,610
We are fine.

599
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,670
Besides, we have Xia Jie with us.

600
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
That's great. That's great.

601
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,060
Well, get them in there.

602
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,940
I'll take care of them.

603
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,980
Xia Jie, here.

604
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,620
Just go ahead, Chief.

605
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,100
-Take her inside.
-Auntie.

606
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,780
Hello, Director Liu.

607
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,940
Look at it.

608
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,700
Sorry to bother you on New Year's Eve.

609
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,530
Our chief

610
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,820
told us

611
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,740
that you're a workaholic.

612
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,340
You're afraid people won't bother you.

613
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,340
Director Liu, I'm telling you,

614
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,020
you have to understand how we feel.

615
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,290
The 100-day operation

616
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,970
ends today.

617
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,500
If we can't solve the case,

618
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,180
we're done.

619
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,690
So, Director Liu,

620
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,740
I need your support.

621
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,250
On behalf of

622
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,940
all the police of Balihe Police Station,

623
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,770
I salute you.

624
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,500
Okay, okay, okay.

625
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,310
Director Liu,

626
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,980
if you come to Pingling in the future,

627
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,940
you must tell me.

628
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,020
I'll treat you to dinner.

629
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,220
Okay. Okay, okay.

630
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,490
Deal.

631
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,060
Okay.

632
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,020
Okay, that's it.

633
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,300
That's it. That's it. Okay.

634
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,770
My goodness.

635
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,470
Chief.

636
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,260
Chief Wang.

637
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,980
There you are.

638
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,740
Thank you.

639
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,870
Yaya!

640
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,780
Did you say hello?

641
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,600
Happy new year, uncle.

642
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,220
Yaya, happy new year.

643
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,050
Okay, okay, okay.

644
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,650
Let's go. Go inside.

645
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,980
Come on, come on, come on. You go too.

646
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,580
Hurry up. Hurry up.

647
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Go inside. Go inside.

648
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,540
Yin,

649
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,010
is everyone here?

650
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,500
Yes, yes.

651
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,980
Go, go, go. Let's go.

652
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,740
Okay, okay, okay.

653
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,550
Bro.

654
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,220
How is it going?

655
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,940
I just walked around

656
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,380
and there's only one door in the yard.

657
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,460
The windows are in the back,

658
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,860
and through the windows

659
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,260
I could see the people working inside.

660
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,780
They should be preparing the New Year's Eve dinner.

661
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,260
I'm sure he's at home.

662
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,460
Zhang,

663
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,780
here's the formality.

664
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,650
These are the two comrades

665
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,940
sent by Qi Bei to assist us in our operation.

666
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,620
They also brought us six walkie-talkies.

667
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,050
Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,620
Hello. Hello.

669
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,090
You're welcome.

670
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,700
Thank you. Thank you.

671
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,260
Look, today is Chinese New Year.

672
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,430
I'm sorry you can't spend the New Year at home.

673
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,220
It's okay.

674
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,620
That's what everybody does.

675
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,890
But, Officer Zhang,

676
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,270
our director said,

677
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,260
you can arrest him,

678
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,080
but you can't spoil the atmosphere of the people's New Year.

679
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,300
Sure, sure.

680
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,580
You identified him?

681
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,220
Yes.

682
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,170
His name is Zheng Youqian.

683
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,980
It's poignant to talk about him.

684
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,300
He has parents

685
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,940
and two children.

686
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,140
Can't he do anything else?

687
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,940
Why is he doing this?

688
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,140
If he leaves with us today,

689
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,860
who knows when he'll come back.

690
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,460
Yes.

691
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,050
A man

692
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,980
can take any path,

693
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,210
but not an evil one.

694
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:32,780
Yes.

695
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,110
It's almost time to have New Year's Eve dinner.

696
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,940
Maybe we should wait until they have their New Year's Eve dinner.

697
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,010
Okay?

698
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,620
Let's find a place to have New Year's Eve dinner.

699
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,540
Okay.

700
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,580
On this day,

701
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,620
every restaurant that is open is fully booked.

702
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,260
Yes.

703
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,220
Let's find a place to loosen up.

704
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,150
Okay.

705
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,730
Okay?

706
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,740
Let's go, go, go.

707
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,350
Don't run!

708
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,900
Happy New Year.

709
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,090
Is it good?

710
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,470
Here, here, here. eat it, eat it.

711
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,020
-Cheers. -Happy New Year.

712
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Happy New Year.

713
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,450
Happy New Year, Jiajia.

714
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,700
Chief. Chief.

715
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,560
Happy New Year.

716
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,500
Happy New Year.

717
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,740
Guys, I'd like to say something.

718
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,370
A year of nostalgia

719
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,860
is coming to an end.

720
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,420
An exciting new spring

721
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,010
is coming.

722
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,780
Great, great, great!

723
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,840
In the past year,

724
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,490
any achievements

725
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,030
of Balihe Police Station

726
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,590
were inseparable from the strong support

727
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,780
of all of you present here!

728
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,580
I also hope that

729
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,980
in the new year,

730
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,540
all of you can support

731
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,220
our Balihe Police Station's work!

732
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,840
Please, please.

733
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,140
Here, I

734
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,460
drink tea instead of wine

735
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,100
to all of us

736
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,390
for our hard work last year

737
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,500
and for greater achievements

738
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,420
in the new year.

739
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,900
Let's have a toast.

740
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,260
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

741
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,540
Where's the car?

742
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,050
It seems to go that way.

743
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,700
Master. Master.

744
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,880
Drive the car over there.

745
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,100
Drive the car over there. Don't stop. Don't stop.

746
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,300
Stop, stop, stop.

747
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,140
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

748
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,620
Is it his car?

749
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,370
Yes.

750
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,820
I looked at the license plate. This is Pingling's.

751
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,250
Is he in the car?

752
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,699
No.

753
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,739
How about this?

754
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,860
You wait in the car.

755
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,250
I'll check it out.

756
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,840
Master, I'll go with you.

757
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,780
No, no, no.

758
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,139
Two people are easy to be spotted.

759
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,139
Dawei,

760
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,170
when I get out,

761
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,650
you move the car forward.

762
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,699
Find a private place to wait for me.

763
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,420
And turn off the lights.

764
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,620
Don't turn on your phone.

765
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,670
Master,

766
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,219
let me go with you.

767
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,500
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

768
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,390
I need to find a safe place and turn off the lights.

769
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,670
Wait.

770
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,090
Grandpa. Grandma. Come and play with me.

771
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,180
Wait.

772
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,340
Stop the operation.

773
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,320
Stop the operation immediately.

774
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,480
Attention, all teams. Stop the operation.

775
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,720
Stop the operation immediately.

776
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,810
Don't arrest him in front of the old people and children.

777
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,900
Attention, all teams.

778
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,280
Suspend the operation.

779
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,400
Everyone stops the operation. Stay out of sight.

780
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,140
Now he

781
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,140
is setting off firecrackers with the old people and children.

782
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,270
Stay hidden. Wait for my order.

783
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,100
Master.

784
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,540
Later.

785
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,570
When they finish setting off firecrackers,

786
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,260
the old people and children will have a rest in a short while.

787
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,290
It won't take long.

788
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,890
Go, go, go. Don't stay here.

789
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,520
Let's go.

790
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:10,970
What makes you in a daze?

791
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,850
I miss my parents.

792
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,340
Have a good Chinese New Year.

793
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,100
Thank you, Chief.

794
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:42,910
We're leaving.

795
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,020
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

796
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,690
Bye.

797
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,670
Take care.

798
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,980
The Spring Festival gala is about to start.

799
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,700
Get back to watch the show.

800
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,970
They'll be back tomorrow.

801
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,820
They'll be with you soon enough.

802
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,280
Okay, okay, okay.

803
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,300
Thank you for your work.

804
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,220
Okay, okay, okay. All right, all right.

805
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,340
Slow down on the road.

806
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,610
-Don't worry. Don't worry.
-I'll take them back.

807
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,340
Go ahead.

808
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,300
Bye.

809
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,340
Bye, Jiajia.

810
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,250
Bye. Bye.

811
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,660
Let's go. Let's go.

812
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,590
Auntie.

813
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Take care. Take care.

814
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,890
Happy new year. Happy new year.

815
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,220
Happy new year. Bye. Bye.

816
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,030
Be careful when you drive.

817
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,620
Bye. Bye.

818
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,100
It's quite late, Instructor.

819
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,700
You should pack up and go back.

820
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,410
It's okay. I'll stay.

821
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,350
You have a lot of work to do at home.

822
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,950
Don't worry. The three of us are here.

823
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,780
-Yes.
-Go back.

824
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,500
Go back. I'm serious.

825
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,130
Go back.

826
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,850
It's rare to get together with your family.

827
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,200
Well, thank you.

828
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,100
You're welcome.

829
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,470
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Just pack up.

830
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,340
I'll go up and clean up.

831
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,800
Okay, okay, okay. All right, all right.

832
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,160
Zhi Gang, come on, let's go.

833
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,690
Let’s go.

834
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,400
Let's go.

835
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,700
Go. Let's go back. It's cold.

836
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,090
Take the kids home. It's late.

837
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,260
Dad. Mom. Go home and get some rest.

838
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,010
It's late.

839
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,910
Youqian, remember to lock the car.

840
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,260
Clean the door more carefully.

841
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,250
We can't sweep the floor tomorrow,

842
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,430
because it'll wipe out a year's wealth.

843
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,660
Okay, go to bed.

844
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:21,910
Come on, give it to me.

845
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,750
Don't move!

846
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,430
Let go of me!

847
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,170
Handcuff him. Handcuff him.

848
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,980
We're from Balihe Police Station.

849
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,250
Did you hear what I said?

850
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,190
Listen.

851
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,200
We waited outside for hours

852
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,490
so as not to disturb your parents and children.

853
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,930
If you don't behave,

854
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,620
they're the ones who get scared.

855
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,330
Do you hear me?

856
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,300
Did you put the cuffs on him?

857
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,970
Yes.

858
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:01,760
Pull him up.

859
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,470
Zheng Youqian, listen carefully.

860
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,470
You're under criminal detention

861
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,400
on suspicion of burglary.

862
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,460
Take him away.

863
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,060
Wait, wait.

864
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,660
I want to go inside and say a few words to my family.

865
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,980
Say a few words. Say a few words.

866
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,400
Zheng Youqian, you have to think about it.

867
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,390
We surrounded the front and back of your house.

868
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,980
We waited until now

869
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,160
for your parents and children.

870
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,000
Did you hear me?

871
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,940
Officer, I've been in jail.

872
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,290
I know.

873
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
If I leave like this,

874
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,990
I don't know when I'll be back.

875
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,090
They'll be worried if they can't find me.

876
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,280
I beg you.

877
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,440
Let me have a word with them.

878
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,760
Please.

879
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,910
All right.

880
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,450
Take the cuffs off.

881
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,350
Remember what I just told you.

882
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,700
Don't forget.

883
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,450
Take out the car key.

884
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,270
Go inside.
