Qizi.

6
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,979
In the morning meeting,

7
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,220
report the current situation

8
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,539
to the chief.

9
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:48,979
Come on.

10
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,300
Be careful.

11
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,220
Comrades,

12
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,229
the chief came to work despite his illness.

13
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,979
-Slow down. -Here.

14
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,170
-Slow down. -Here.

15
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,820
-Slowly. -Slow down.

16
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,660
You two. You two.

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,300
Hold him up.

18
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,020
Slow down.

19
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,850
Good.

20
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,090
Chief, you're already like this.

21
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,620
Why don't you rest?

22
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,780
Yes chief.

23
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,400
You should be careful of your waist.

24
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,460
Work is important.

25
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,220
Your health is also important.

26
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,820
You should rest.

27
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,540
That's right.

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,040
I didn't think my old pain...

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,440
Chief, you're already like this.

30
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,800
Take a few more days off.

31
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,760
You still don't trust us?

32
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,180
Yeah.

33
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,770
What day off?

34
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,300
I have to work.

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,530
The waist pain is not an illness.

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,000
Besides,

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,310
I won't be able to work at the Balihe station for long.

38
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,020
Every single day is precious.

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,890
Chief, don't be so sentimental.

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,570
You are not retiring.

41
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,579
You're going to be a researcher at the bureau.

42
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
Though it's not a promotion,

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,660
it's a transfer.

44
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,780
You're welcome to come back anytime.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,579
Come to take a look, right.

46
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,780
Yeah.

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,780
What promotion?

48
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,140
We are the police.

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,210
We're ordinary people.

50
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,180
We have been working hard at Balihe

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,860
to create

52
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,100
a united and warm team.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,540
But this year,

54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,780
we've encountered many challenges.

55
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,260
Many things have happened.

56
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,980
So for the third quarter...

57
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,300
Don't worry, chief.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,280
During your position as the chief,

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,020
no matter what it takes,

60
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,010
our station has to win the first place.

61
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,810
Our chief can retire

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,640
with honor.

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,790
Our Balihe station

64
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,210
will leave you with something to miss.

65
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,860
It's wishful thinking

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,530
for our station to win the first place.

67
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,100
If we can break our highest record,

68
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll be satisfied.

69
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,180
We want to be the first!

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,500
You got ambitions!

71
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,990
First I have good news.

72
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,579
The bureau decided

73
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,940
that Mr. Zhang Zhijie will study in the Party School for six months.

74
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,820
A round of applause!

75
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,140
Thank you.

76
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,340
Thank you.

77
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,220
Thank you.

78
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,300
Thank you for the trust!

79
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,220
Thank you chief! Thank you all!

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,580
I will work hard.

81
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,740
Congratulations, master.

82
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,330
This is to prepare the second-in-command

83
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,810
for our Bailihe station.

84
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,100
Right.

85
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,019
Zhijie,

86
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,540
you will be on leave for over six months.

87
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,019
Who is going to be Jiwei's master?

88
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,860
Then, Jiwei.

89
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,460
You can shadow me.

90
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,660
You should shadow me.

91
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,410
You can be with Xu in the morning.

92
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,490
You'll be with Du in the afternoon.

93
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,620
You can be with me at night.

94
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,940
What are you talking about? He's mine at night.

95
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,980
All right. Enough.

96
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,340
It's getting off-topic.

97
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,370
You guys.

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,980
Who do you think Zhao is?

99
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,050
Zhao, do your best.

100
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,980
You're going to be a full-time police officer soon.

101
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,050
Work harder.

102
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,980
Chief Gao.

103
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,240
You should pay more attention to Zhao.

104
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,620
For the community,

105
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,180
when I was on leave,

106
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,060
you took the role,

107
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,260
and did a good job.

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,100
When Zhijie is away,

109
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,530
you should bear it in mind more.

110
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,670
Do your job well.

111
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,260
Yes sir.

112
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,820
Okay. Everyone, take a seat.

113
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,540
Let's start the morning meeting.

114
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
Can you sit down?

115
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,940
I won't sit.

116
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,900
I'll be standing.

117
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,940
Master, don't worry.

118
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,620
Come on. Sit down.

119
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,250
If you say so,

120
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,020
the theft in my trunk

121
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,610
can't be solved anymore.

122
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,090
Yes, it can be solved.

123
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,260
Here's the thing.

124
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,860
Our neighborhood

125
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,740
is a bit old.

126
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,980
There's no underground parking lot.

127
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,810
The cars

128
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,990
are parked at the roadside.

129
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,090
There's only a few

130
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,380
surveillance cameras in this neighborhood.

131
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Objectively speaking,

132
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,940
it has made it convenient

133
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,330
for thieves

134
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,480
to stole from the trunks.

135
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,300
Meanwhile,

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,420
it has brought about difficulties

137
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,500
for us to solve the case.

138
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,940
-So... -So what?

139
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,650
So I deserved to be stolen?

140
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,360
No.

141
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,659
You can't say that.

142
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,380
I hope you can be patient,

143
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,980
and give us more time.

144
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,340
It has been half a month.

145
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,860
Nothing changed at all.

146
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,409
Since things got stolen in my trunk,

147
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,380
in this neighborhood,

148
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
this has happened to three cars already.

149
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,659
Did you care about it?

150
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,659
If Officer Zhang was here,

151
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,930
he wouldn't allow this to happen.

152
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,980
Zhao.

153
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,690
Cao.

154
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,930
You're off work.

155
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,450
Why are you standing here?

156
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,020
You see these cars.

157
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,580
There's no underground parking lot in the neighborhood.

158
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,620
The cars are parked at the roadside.

159
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,240
It's getting warmer.

160
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,790
The thieves are also active.

161
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,140
Recently,

162
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,980
there have been several cases

163
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,820
of items stolen from car trunks.

164
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,780
I already reported it to

165
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,530
the municipality and subdistrict

166
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,810
to install more surveillance cameras.

167
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,570
They said they would plan it

168
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,500
when the highway construction would be completed.

169
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,060
Look at this.

170
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,140
When the highway construction will be completed.

171
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,820
How long will that take?

172
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,340
Exactly.

173
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,620
The suspect wasn't caught.

174
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,980
People have started complaining.

175
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,700
They've complained several times these days.

176
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,180
You have to catch him.

177
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,020
We can't solve the case without surveillance cameras.

178
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,460
When I was in the municipality,

179
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,580
they said the same thing.

180
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,050
How can you catch a person without surveillance cameras?

181
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,580
Use the police's old way. It's a basic skill.

182
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,820
Keeping watch.

183
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,380
Keeping watch?

184
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,700
You mean to keep watch,

185
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,890
and catch him red-handed.

186
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,340
What else?

187
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,780
What else can we do?

188
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,659
Zhao.

189
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,140
I'll help you.

190
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,550
No need, Cao.

191
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,770
No thanks.

192
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,660
Well,

193
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,230
chief said.

194
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,060
What did he say?

195
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,900
Chief...

196
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,420
didn't say anything.

197
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,140
Cao.

198
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,180
Madam is waiting for you at home.

199
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,890
You better go home now.

200
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,180
I need to go too.

201
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,220
This street.

202
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,740
And the one in the south.

203
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,850
The four of us here.

204
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,220
The four of you there.

205
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,140
Two people stay at each side.

206
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,260
Based on my judgement,

207
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,700
it has been three days

208
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
since he last committed a crime.

209
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,730
According to his pattern,

210
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,700
it is very likely

211
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,460
he will commit again in these days.

212
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,740
It's almost one o'clock.

213
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,660
Let's check the watch.

214
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,270
I think he's coming.

215
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,140
Two people stay at each side.

216
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,140
Let's arrest him today.

217
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,730
No hurries.

218
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,780
It's a long street.

219
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,500
There are a few intersections in the middle.

220
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,100
If he shows up, how can we block him?

221
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,660
And in the middle of the night.

222
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,860
There's no one on the street.

223
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,140
If we show up,

224
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,060
he would have fled already.

225
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,650
We always have this many people.

226
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,690
What can you do?

227
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,940
On the bright side,

228
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,500
there are many cars on the street.

229
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,770
There are many trees.

230
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,580
We can find places to hide.

231
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,020
Okay. Okay.

232
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,550
Just do as Zhao said.

233
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,540
Zhao, Xu and I will lead a team.

234
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,340
We'll guard this street.

235
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,780
You should guard the intersection at the back.

236
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,700
We'll block him at two ends.

237
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,430
Let's go.

238
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,100
Don't be too hard on him.

239
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,770
When I saw him during the day,

240
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,300
it reminded me of my rookie times.

241
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,760
Lin and I will be at the back.

242
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,050
You stay here.

243
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,580
Okay. Let's go.

244
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,290
There are more intersections on this street.

245
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,660
How about this?

246
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,220
We each guard one intersection.

247
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,420
If he shows up,

248
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,300
one can act first.

249
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,420
The rest of us follow.

250
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,090
What do you think?

251
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,540
Good.

252
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,980
Remember.

253
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,340
Don't fall asleep. Don't look at your phone.

254
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,420
Don't kill mosquitos.

255
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,670
Don't startle him.

256
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,590
Don't worry.

257
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,490
Zhao.

258
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,510
Who's there?

259
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,460
Cao.

260
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,180
But

261
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,660
why are you here?

262
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,350
It's hot. I don't want to stay at home.

263
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,300
Come sit.

264
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,400
Come over here.

265
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,020
What if he shows up soon?

266
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,100
Come on.

267
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,100
Cao.

268
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,060
Move and sit on it.

269
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,730
Zhao, tell me about it.

270
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,700
I'll help you analyze

271
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,460
the probability of him showing up.

272
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,850
Cao, here's the thing.

273
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,780
Someone is here.

274
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,090
But.

275
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,580
He's here. Why are you shrinking?

276
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,010
I...I'm shrinking?

277
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,820
What do you think?

278
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,960
Keeping watch.

279
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,940
How can you easily find the target?

280
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,130
Go on.

281
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,660
What did you just say?

282
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,380
-Mosquitoes -Keep it down.

283
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,560
-So many mosquitoes. -Keep it down.

284
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,100
It's okay.

285
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,980
Just a short while,

286
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,130
I got bit seven to eight times.

287
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,700
Ding.

288
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,290
Didn't the mosquitos bite you?

289
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
Of course they did.

290
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,520
Didn't you say we cannot kill them?

291
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,820
Cao Jianjun went there too.

292
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,620
He was already there when we arrived.

293
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,770
Nonsense!

294
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,060
How would he know if you didn't tell him?

295
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,930
Chief, it really wasn't me.

296
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,140
Chief,

297
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,780
can we ask for some rewards for Cao?

298
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,580
No.

299
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,450
First, he isn't one of us.

300
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,580
Second,

301
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,970
we did not ask for his assistance.

302
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,990
It has nothing to do with him.

303
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,700
Got it?

304
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,180
But...

305
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,340
But what?

306
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,900
You may leave.

307
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,790
What?

308
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,500
That's what the chief said.

309
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,140
When we sought assistance from the Joint Security Force,

310
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,420
they received subsidies as well.

311
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,380
How can the chief be so harsh on Jianjun?

312
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,810
The tea cools down

313
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,220
as soon as the person is gone.

314
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't you think?

315
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,420
You have nothing to do, right?

316
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Then go to the community,

317
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,900
and check the safety risks.

318
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,770
Zhigang, Qizi, come here.

319
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,460
Let's go.

320
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,140
Jianjun.

321
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,190
Cao.

322
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,610
Why are you running away from me?

323
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,580
No I didn't.

324
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,610
Chief.

325
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,420
How's everything?

326
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,710
Zhou Hui and your kid are doing well, right?

327
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,310
Yes.

328
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,650
How much do you earn a month here?

329
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,390
3,500 yuan.

330
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,070
3,500 is too little.

331
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,180
You're earning less than Zhou Hui, right.

332
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,000
Just half as hers.

333
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,980
Jianjun,

334
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,240
there's a saying.

335
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,690
Life is hard for a couple in poverty.

336
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,040
It makes sense.

337
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,940
She's your wife.

338
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,860
You expect her to be with you when you're poor.

339
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,010
To be with you when you're rich.

340
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,460
But why?

341
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,690
Zhou Hui is a good girl.

342
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,020
A good girl shouldn't be up for challenges.

343
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,900
She has already suffered a lot for you.

344
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,790
You should give her a good life

345
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,980
to live up to her good heart.

346
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,210
You should work hard and make money.

347
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,609
You should support your family.

348
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,530
You don't work at the police station anymore.

349
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,579
I hope in the future

350
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,220
you won't be involved in the police's work.

351
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,579
Do you understand?

352
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,690
Yes sir.

353
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,900
Okay, that's good.

354
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,660
That's all I have to say.

355
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,830
I hope I won't see you again.

356
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,490
Take care.

357
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,460
Chief.

358
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,940
The station

359
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,940
doesn't want me anymore.

360
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,510
Yes.

361
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,220
You don't belong to the police anymore.

362
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,740
It has been three days.

363
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,140
Why isn't he coming?

364
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,320
If he doesn't come,

365
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,890
nobody can stand it anymore.

366
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,260
Cao,

367
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,900
I asked for a reward for you.

368
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,550
But...

369
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,100
I don't want it.

370
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,750
How can that be?

371
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,530
Cao, when we catch the thief,

372
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,340
I'll ask for a reward for you.

373
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,110
I don't want it.

374
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,000
Zhao,

375
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,020
you're a good man.

376
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
You should value it.

377
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,670
Got it, Cao.

378
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,140
It's not him.

379
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,380
Cao,

380
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,510
you're not even looking.

381
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,890
You're able to tell by the sound.

382
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,760
If he rode a motorcycle,

383
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
he would be able to flee quickly.

384
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
But he would make a loud noise.

385
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,220
Wouldn't he disclose his time of committing the crime?

386
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,620
You're right.

387
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,930
You are more experienced.

388
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,060
If you were still a police officer...

389
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,020
That's why I told you to value it.

390
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,200
When you're not,

391
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,060
it's too late to regret.

392
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,720
Someone's coming.

393
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,980
Is he the one?

394
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,200
No, he isn't.

395
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,500
You can't be impatient when keeping watch.

396
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,860
The more impatient you get, the less likely he will come.

397
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,940
When you aren't impatient,

398
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,560
maybe he'll come.

399
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,100
What a job.

400
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,450
I'm a man

401
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,460
who has been bitten by mosquitoes every day.

402
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,820
I dare to say after this job,

403
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,300
the mosquitoes will grow into the size of pigs.

404
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,590
The problem is when we will finish the job.

405
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,160
Thank you for your effort, Xu.

406
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,690
No worries.

407
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,950
It's my job.

408
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,390
-Du, let me get you some water. -No thanks.

409
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,220
I'll do it myself.

410
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,970
The problem is...

411
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,100
Zhao.

412
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,750
Is your analysis accurate?

413
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
It has been four days.

414
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,860
No one has shown up.

415
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,210
Zhao, he has stolen for many times.

416
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,180
Maybe he thought

417
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,820
he stole enough here,

418
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,940
and changed a spot.

419
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,220
If so,

420
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,980
our efforts will be to no avail.

421
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,590
I don't know.

422
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,910
But I feel he will come back again.

423
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,810
You feel?

424
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,060
Didn't you say

425
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,400
he committed the crime every three to five days?

426
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,590
It has been four days.

427
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,850
With the previous seven days.

428
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,010
He hasn't shown up yet.

429
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,820
I don't know.

430
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,900
But that was his trail before.

431
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,570
Jiwei,

432
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,670
come here.

433
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,770
Look at your nose.

434
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,340
What? Nothing happened yet?

435
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,410
Keeping watch.

436
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,630
You must be patient.

437
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,980
Got it, Chief Gao.

438
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,820
Take this.

439
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,570
We're asking them to help.

440
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,630
We must be sincere.

441
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,810
[Essential balm]

442
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,820
You can go now.

443
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you, Chief Gao.

444
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,620
On that shelf over there.

445
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,830
See. All the mosquito repellents.

446
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:15,980
Is there anything you like?

447
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,790
This really works.

448
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,300
42 a bottle.

449
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,780
That's expensive.

450
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,740
Expensive?

451
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,040
We have ones that are more expensive.

452
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,560
Of course. We have cheaper ones as well.

453
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,430
Which one do you want?

454
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,450
I'll take this.

455
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,050
Sure.

456
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,120
42 is fine.

457
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,090
I'll take

458
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,140
eight bottles.

459
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,140
Eight bottles.

460
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,780
This is mosquito repellent cream.

461
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,230
One is enough.

462
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,860
You want eight?

463
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,710
Yes.

464
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,620
Okay. Good.

465
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,730
Here are seven drumsticks.

466
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,180
I'll take a pack of mineral water.

467
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,830
Got it.

468
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,340
Can you help me put them in seven bags?

469
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,920
Seven bags.

470
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,700
Sure. Sure.

471
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,390
And also the pork.

472
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,490
How much do you want?

473
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,290
Two catties.

474
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,190
Got it.

475
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,140
-Jiwei, so many things. -Zhigang.

476
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,260
How's everything?

477
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,970
Are there any chances tonight?

478
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,880
I don't know.

479
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,710
I'm so anxious.

480
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,420
Don't worry.

481
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,730
He maybe show up tonight.

482
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,870
Let me help you.

483
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,270
Zhao,

484
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,670
if the suspect doesn't show up tonight,

485
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,870
you better find someone else.

486
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
Okay. Okay.

487
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,890
Well,

488
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,880
this is the midnight snack I prepared for everyone.

489
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,380
This is the essential balm.

490
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,500
This is the mosquito repellent cream.

491
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,660
Please apply it.

492
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,110
Have some food first.

493
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,740
Ding, take it.

494
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,780
Take it.

495
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Qiancheng, here.

496
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,620
Thank you. Thank you.

497
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,180
Here. Take it.

498
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,550
Xu, here.

499
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,330
No thanks.

500
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,040
Please take it.

501
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,540
Du.

502
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,350
Dawei.

503
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
-Take it. -I'll help myself.

504
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,920
Water.

505
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,830
Here.

506
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,230
Please. Show up.

507
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,660
You are exactly like me when I was young.

508
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,980
There's no chance of going back.

509
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,540
Cao. Cao.

510
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,740
What did you just day?

511
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,620
I said I envy you.

512
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,060
Me?

513
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,170
Cao, apply more mosquito repellent cream.

514
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,340
Too many mosquitoes here.

515
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,940
Apply some.

516
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,050
No thanks.

517
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,860
I'm covered with calluses from the mosquito bites.

518
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,060
Officer! Officer!

519
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,570
Officer! Here!

520
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,060
Look at this. Look at this.

521
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,340
Look at this.

522
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,630
Did you call the police?

523
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,130
Yes, it was me.

524
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,700
We've been keeping watch for five days.

525
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,500
But he committed a crime here.

526
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,600
What does it mean?

527
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,580
It means the pattern we have analyzed

528
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,650
isn't correct.

529
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,220
Xu, you can't say that.

530
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,650
Zhao Jiwei analyzed

531
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,820
his previous pattern of stealing.

532
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,170
He is able to move around.

533
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,000
Who could've thought

534
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,310
he went there last night?

535
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,730
Could it be that

536
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,140
he already found out we were waiting for him?

537
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
If so,

538
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,580
we could never see him show up.

539
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,740
Impossible.

540
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,140
How could he know?

541
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,600
He doesn't have any informer at our station.

542
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,940
At least,

543
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,490
it means he has expanded his scope of committing crimes.

544
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,180
How can we follow him then?

545
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,020
You're back.

546
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,380
How is it? Anything new?

547
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,530
Wei Wei, sit down.

548
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,660
It's okay.

549
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,250
At least it showed

550
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,820
the previous pattern of stealing we have analyzed

551
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,570
was correct.

552
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,990
Yesterday was the fifth day.

553
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,060
He showed up.

554
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,060
If he's committing crimes at separate locations,

555
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,710
we can't wait

556
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,770
at one spot to catch him.

557
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,970
I'm sorry.

558
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,560
Everybody is suffering because of me.

559
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,530
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

560
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,150
It's normal not to catch anybody while on watch.

561
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,810
According to the pattern you analyzed,

562
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,540
he would steal things every three to five days.

563
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,240
He did it last night.

564
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,280
At least within these three days,

565
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,450
he won't do it again.

566
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,330
Let's take a break.

567
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,850
We've been working nonstop.

568
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,810
It's quite too much.

569
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,550
Take a break.

570
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,390
It's okay.

571
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,410
We can rest for at least three days.

572
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,600
Let's study the case.

573
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,610
Look at this.

574
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,490
Is there anything missing?

575
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,970
Du, Xu, Qiancheng.

576
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,100
Zhao, it has been eight days.

577
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,620
When will this end?

578
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,460
Can we finish it before New Year?

579
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,690
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,090
You'r suffering because of me.

581
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,910
No. What?

582
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,060
Who do you think you are?

583
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,980
I'm sorry.

584
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,860
I'm not good with words.

585
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,700
But if I can't catch him,

586
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,500
I'll keep watch.

587
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,390
I know you've been working hard lately.

588
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,730
Why don't you take a rest?

589
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,140
I'll go by myself.

590
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,690
Okay, go by yourself.

591
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,060
Don't go.

592
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,470
Listen.

593
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,260
How dare he?

594
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,480
Keep saying I.

595
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,020
Who are we working for?

596
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,840
Is it for him?

597
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,950
Who does he think he is?

598
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,010
What happened?

599
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,510
You didn't go on watch.

600
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,740
Xia Jie. Xia Jie.

601
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,580
Xia Jie. Wake up.

602
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,020
Xia Jie.

603
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,290
It's already one o'clock.

604
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,150
Zhao Jiwei didn't call us.

605
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,020
He left first.

606
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,280
Hurry up.

607
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,400
Did you apply the repellent cream?

608
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,370
What's the point?

609
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,430
It has already formed calluses.

610
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,230
Hurry!

611
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,380
Xu, if we aren't going, I'll cook some noodles.

612
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,430
Ding, stay out of it.

613
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,940
I'll go change and stay with them.

614
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,570
Why are you so nosy?

615
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,700
Chief.

616
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,390
Chief.

617
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,290
Where's Zhao?

618
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,920
Since you're here,

619
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,820
why didn't you leave with Zhao?

620
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,980
Chief, well...

621
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,740
He doesn't know how to talk properly.

622
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,660
Don't just stand there.

623
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,740
Apply the mosquito repellent cream.

624
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,440
Let's go.

625
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,860
Are we late?

626
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,740
No.

627
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,330
Zhao, over here.

628
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,900
Cao.

629
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,920
Why are you on your own today?

630
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,500
It's okay.

631
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
We can still do this.

632
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,020
How about this?

633
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,100
Let's watch on each end.

634
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,510
If he comes,

635
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,820
we can chase him in the same direction.

636
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,570
Is it okay?

637
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,220
You stay here.

638
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,830
I'll be on that side.

639
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,220
Cao.

640
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,330
Thank you.

641
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,270
Chief.

642
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,130
Zhao, you're here.

643
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,280
Chief, why are you here?

644
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,640
I'm getting old.

645
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,070
I can't sleep.

646
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,040
I came to see you.

647
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,250
Are you alone?

648
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,020
What's the matter?

649
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,040
Why are you crying?

650
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,230
What happened?

651
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,130
You see.

652
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,020
Chief Cheng.

653
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,370
You've made everyone feel touched.

654
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,000
Chief Cheng and his team

655
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,170
came to support you.

656
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,360
This is our station's matter now.

657
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,380
If we can't catch him,

658
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,110
we won't give up.

659
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,600
Wipe your tears.

660
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,210
You're crying.

661
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,140
You feel wronged.

662
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,060
Get down!

663
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:10,730
If you don't get down,

664
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,370
and show yourself,

665
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,290
you'll waste the night again.

666
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,140
Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

667
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,230
Chief, your waist.

668
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,140
It's okay. Sit down.

669
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,180
It's okay.

670
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,220
Careful. What are you doing?

671
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,340
Chief.

672
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,420
I have a raincoat.

673
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,780
Good.

674
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,310
Water.

675
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,920
Okay. I'll drink some.

676
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,680
And mosquitos repellent cream.

677
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,530
I need it.

678
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,780
Well done, young man.

679
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,730
You're well prepared.

680
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,980
You never fight a battle without preparation, right?

681
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,460
Good. I have to praise you.

682
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,100
But tell me,

683
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,820
why were you crying?

684
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,700
I just think

685
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,030
I'm quite stupid.

686
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,050
I'm not good at anything.

687
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,820
When I make mistakes,

688
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,060
I don't even know what to do.

689
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,540
I don't even know who to ask.

690
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,260
In the past, I had my master.

691
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,030
Now, my master is away.

692
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,380
Zhao.

693
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,650
Look at you.

694
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,090
You reminded me of

695
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,830
myself when I first joined the police.

696
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,350
I started a lot worse than you.

697
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,910
I was born in the rural area.

698
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,750
I've only been educated for a few years.

699
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,100
After being in the army for a few years,

700
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,020
I was demobilized to the public security system.

701
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,120
Then I became a police officer.

702
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,540
Chief.

703
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,600
You're also from the rural area.

704
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,860
That's right.

705
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,470
As people from the rural area,

706
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,750
when we come to the city,

707
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,420
we don't have any networks

708
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,860
nor foundations.

709
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,610
What do we have?

710
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,100
We are hardworking.

711
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,240
We stand while others sit.

712
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,450
We walk while others stand.

713
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,410
We run while others walk.

714
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,010
We can work harder than others.

715
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,820
What do we lack?

716
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,380
We haven't seen and experienced much.

717
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,340
We lack perspectives.

718
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,490
But we can

719
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,230
gain perspectives.

720
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,580
When you see and experience things,

721
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,320
you'll broaden your perspective.

722
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,420
But if you don't work hard

723
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,060
when you're young,

724
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,260
you won't have it in life.

725
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,600
With your hard work,

726
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,060
you can become a great police officer.

727
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,780
But I heard

728
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,240
you've been quite close with Cao Jianjun recently.

729
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,000
Learn from his lesson.

730
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,400
Don't forget about it as a warning.

731
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:26,970
Chief.

732
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,300
Got it.

733
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,570
Is it him?

734
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,590
No, it's not.

735
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,540
Come on. Sit down.

736
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,740
Where was I?

737
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,850
You said

738
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,900
don't forget.

739
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,610
Don't forget what?

740
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,730
Don't forget to go home.

741
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,170
Did I say this?

742
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,920
I said don't forget to remind myself

743
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,700
to tell you to go home.

744
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,990
You sure went a long way

745
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,690
to say it.

746
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,780
Wait. Wait.

747
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,850
Chief.

748
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,770
Go!

749
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,710
Stop!

750
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,590
-Police! -Stop!

751
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,330
This is my first time.

752
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,040
Cuff him.

753
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,870
Pull him up.

754
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,820
Ask him where he is from.

755
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,940
-Let me go. -Get up. Get up.

756
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,710
-Besides, -It's my first time.

757
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,060
take him to his place.

758
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,610
Yes sir.

759
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:37,790
Chief Cheng.

760
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,670
You're here.

761
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,580
Didn't I say

762
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,830
I was the lucky star?

763
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,560
I was supposed to assign a rotation to keep watch.

764
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,450
I didn't expect,

765
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,720
on the first of work,

766
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,040
I caught the suspect.

767
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,780
Chief Cheng, I'm leaving now.

768
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,420
Chief.

769
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,580
Jianjun has been following you.

770
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,540
When I arrived, he was already here.

771
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,900
How many time have I told you?

772
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,140
Don't mind him. Don't mind him.

773
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,480
Why won't you listen?

774
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,560
Chief.

775
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,060
How can I not listen?

776
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,660
All right. Let's go.

777
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,010
Let's clap for Zhao.

778
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,420
When we rushed to his house,

779
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,130
the stolen goods were all there.

780
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,760
There were so many.

781
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,270
He was caught red-handed.

782
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,540
The money involved

783
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,900
was more than 50 thousand.

784
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,140
Zhao, you did a great job.

785
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,380
You solved a big case.

786
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,170
It wasn't me.

787
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,470
It was everybody.

788
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,980
Look at him.

789
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,050
His master isn't here.

790
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,110
He not only learned to solve cases,

791
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,930
he also learned to be humble.

792
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,180
Let's give him another round of applause.

793
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,080
I'm serious.

794
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,140
I've been here for almost a year.

795
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,770
In this year,

796
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,500
I've been confused.

797
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,310
I didn't know if I can

798
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,740
become a good policeman.

799
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,480
I didn't know if I can do well.

800
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,660
But now I know.

801
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,740
What do you know?

802
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,220
My master once said

803
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,380
I had no other skills.

804
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,660
As long as I work hard,

805
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,860
and try my best,

806
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,870
people will see it sooner or later.

807
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,360
I understand this now.

808
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,290
Captain Luo just called me.

809
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,340
He asked us to find him now.

810
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,860
Any news about our case?

811
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,050
I think so.

812
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,510
Let's go.

813
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,050
Okay.
