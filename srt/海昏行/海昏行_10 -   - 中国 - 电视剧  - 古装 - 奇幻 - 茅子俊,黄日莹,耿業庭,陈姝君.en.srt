Wang.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,070
You've been wronged.

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,590
Thank you, Qingge.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,140
Give me a hand.

34
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,360
- Right.
- Exactly.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,480
I just heard the market
in Jiyang is bustling.

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,950
Would you both care
to join me for a stroll?

37
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,000
- No.
- No.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,120
Still angry?

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,960
- No.
- Not at all.

40
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,680
Bottling up anger is never good.

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,240
I've got a way for you two
to get all that anger out.

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
Humph.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,400
Go for it!

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Nice peck! Keep at it!

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,000
Peck it!

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,280
Peck it!

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,860
Peck it!

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,710
Harder!

49
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,750
It flew away!

50
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,940
- Why?
- A bet's a bet.

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,280
The one who lost should make
the first move to reconcile.

52
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,360
No need.

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
Then I'll just go check on my chicken.

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,550
What's wrong with Qi?

55
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,250
He's just shut himself off.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,680
- Qi.
- Qi.

57
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,840
That's the emblem
of Senior De Jiu's sect.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Today, I'll avenge Master.

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
De Jiu.

60
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,490
Retreat!

61
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,470
Senior.

62
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,750
- Thanks.
- No need.

63
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,310
Are you all alright?

64
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,320
Lady De Jiu.

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,030
Can you take me along
for such things next time?

66
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,290
Then we would've got hurt.

67
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,260
Your old injury has flared up.

68
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,150
About that offer to handle your meals,

69
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,540
why not consider it?

70
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,120
I'll take Lady De Jiu
for treatment first.

71
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,080
You two have a talk.

72
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,970
Go on, quickly now.

73
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,850
Let's go.

74
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,630
What's there to talk about?

75
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,870
Who'd even want to talk to you?

76
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,920
(In Biography of the Five Sons
of Emperor Wu, Book of Han,)

77
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,670
(the Duke wants to find
the long-crowing rooster in Jiyang)

78
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,130
(and buys bamboo staffs on the way.)

79
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,230
(On his journey to the capital
to ascend the throne,)

80
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,910
(Liu He bought two bamboo staffs.)

81
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,960
(Others thought he was just frivolous,)

82
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,180
(but in truth, he was simply thinking
of his grandfather.)

83
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,090
That year,

84
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,490
Grandfather stood upon Mount Tai

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
at the Fengshan Ceremony.

86
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,760
Clad in the dragon robe,

87
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,640
he looked like a deity,
with enormous power,

88
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,010
and the realm bowed before him.

89
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Your grandfather was truly remarkable.

90
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,480
Do you wish to be
an Emperor like he was?

91
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,240
I'm just not cut out to be an Emperor.

92
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,110
Well.

93
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,810
At least you're aware
of your own limits.

94
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,000
Is the Mandate of Heaven

95
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,190
true?

96
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,240
Indeed.

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,310
So, my men from Changyi

98
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,220
will all die?

99
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,270
Yes.

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,850
What about me?

101
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,590
You were Emperor for 27 days.

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,320
In the end,

103
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
Huo Guang dethroned you.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
Why such a big reaction?

105
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,270
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have said anything.

106
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,520
Let me ask you this.

107
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,510
Who is Huo Guang?

108
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,390
Huo Guang is...

109
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,270
What's his title again?

110
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,720
Grand

111
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,060
General.

112
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,070
And me?

113
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,950
You'll be the Emperor.

114
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,830
Who outranks whom?

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,840
You don't believe me?

116
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
I believe you.

117
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,540
But I don't believe in fate.

118
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,210
If worst comes to worst,

119
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,750
let's change our fate.

120
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
It could've been changed.

121
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,580
But you ruined it.

122
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,990
Heng,

123
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,590
was your fate ever foretold

124
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,590
in the Mandate of Heaven?

125
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,710
No.

126
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,640
You're the uncertain fate
I've been waiting for.

127
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,230
After all,

128
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,150
you're an Immortal.

129
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,860
(Huo Mansion)

130
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Milord,

131
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,790
Duke of Changyi, Liu He,
used the Dingtao exam as a pretext

132
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,000
to cut down on redundant staff.

133
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,790
This was suggested

134
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,360
by a remarkable strategist,

135
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,390
Wang Heng.

136
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,000
I've never heard of him.

137
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,540
What's so remarkable about that?

138
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,030
The equine administration in Changyi

139
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,270
and the exam in Dingtao

140
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,550
were all his doing.

141
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,750
His origins are shrouded in mystery.

142
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,390
No ancestry, no roots to trace.

143
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,280
Nor any father or mother to claim.

144
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,350
On the night the Bronze Qilin appeared,

145
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,920
he suddenly emerged in Changyi.

146
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,730
I have

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,280
one more matter to report.

148
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,640
The heroine who evaded capture before

149
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,650
is now among the Duke of Changyi's team.

150
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,760
Regarding this heroine,

151
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,840
do not alert her needlessly.

152
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,220
Simply keep a discreet watch.

153
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,840
- Leave me.
- Yes.

154
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Go on.

155
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,240
Hey.

156
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,360
Wait.

157
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,910
As for Wang Heng,

158
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,670
with no record or ties,

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,670
he may well be of use.

160
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,560
Yes.

161
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,620
(Jiyang)

162
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,740
(Hongnong Lodge, Hongnong)

163
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:21,140
(Hongnong)

164
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,020
Duke.

165
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,320
Isn't it inappropriate for Lady De Jiu

166
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,760
to travel with us to Chang'an?

167
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,960
She is my senior.

168
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,550
Besides, she is injured.

169
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,450
How could I possibly abandon her?

170
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,080
But...

171
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,120
We've arrived in Hongnong.

172
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,710
Rest here and recover.

173
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,880
If you wish to buy goods,
feel free to do so.

174
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,300
Sir, have mercy on the child.

175
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,440
Sir, grant him a bite to eat.

176
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,300
Sir.

177
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,860
Please, have pity.

178
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
(Lodge)

179
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,540
Qi.

180
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
- Duke.
- Lord Gong.

181
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,550
Lord Gong.

182
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,630
Everything here is ready.

183
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,470
Duke.

184
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,860
Does this place
have any unique game dishes?

185
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
I just found the most distinctive game
to be had here.

186
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,010
Shh, go and make the arrangements.

187
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,450
Alright, let's go.

188
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,890
- Qingge, look.
- Yeah.

189
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,010
Let me go!

190
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:33,960
Help me!

191
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,990
Let me go!

192
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,750
- Help!
- Stop!

193
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,600
Let me go!

194
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,900
- You brazen knave!
- Let me go!

195
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,420
Harassing women in public.

196
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,810
Stop running!

197
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,710
Come back here!

198
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,920
Hurry, move!

199
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,110
The situation is too complicated.

200
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,510
This place is not peaceful.
Saving them is enough.

201
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,080
Don't act rashly.

202
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,500
Thanks for stepping in to help.

203
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,590
If it weren't for you,

204
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,560
we might not have made it out alive.

205
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,660
It's okay.

206
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,790
These days,
my fate has been a cruel one.

207
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,000
If you don't mind,

208
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,000
can you take us along?

209
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,750
We can handle
all the hard and dirty work.

210
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,180
We won't trouble you in the least.

211
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,720
Why not let them come with us?

212
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,580
No.

213
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,510
Ladies,

214
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,060
we still have a long way to go.

215
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,910
Take this money instead.

216
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,260
It should keep you fed
and cared for a while.

217
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,240
They are in such pitiful straits.

218
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,320
Why not let them come?

219
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,510
Anywhere will do,

220
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,440
just not Hongnong.

221
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,720
Do we still have the roster
from the last exam?

222
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,750
Everyone saw it today.

223
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,630
The people of Hongnong
are living in great hardship.

224
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,120
The Duke wishes to do
some good deeds here.

225
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,200
It's best if they're done

226
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,950
by a good person.

227
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,650
So among us all,

228
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,840
is there anyone named Shan?

229
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,290
Is your name Shan?

230
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,330
Is your name Shan?

231
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,790
A courtesy name, nickname,
or alias is fine.

232
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,720
Is your name Shan?

233
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,710
So,

234
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,240
being called Shan

235
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,590
means you're a good person?

236
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,480
The locals don't know who we are.

237
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,020
If the messenger's name

238
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,030
has "Shan" in it,

239
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,540
won't that leave a fine impression?

240
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,230
It makes sense.

241
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,350
Anyone?

242
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,910
If you do a good deed,

243
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
the Duke will award you handsomely.

244
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,720
Heng.

245
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,550
You're acting rather strange today.

246
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,150
First, you stepped in to stop me

247
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,240
from helping them,

248
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,550
and now you're seeking someone
I've never heard of.

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,910
Because both of these matters
mean a great deal to you.

250
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,200
How so?

251
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,600
If I were to say

252
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,550
these two matters

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,600
could alter your fate,

254
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,000
would you believe me?

255
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,680
I would.

256
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,840
The Mandate of Heaven says
that when you pass through Hongnong,

257
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,820
you'll have Shan drive the ladies
in a covered cart,

258
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,150
which will tarnish your reputation,

259
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,120
leaving you in a tough position

260
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,720
in Chang'an later.

261
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,080
So, you mean to say

262
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,360
the women we met on the way here

263
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
are those mentioned
in the Mandate of Heaven?

264
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,710
I fear that may be the case.

265
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,200
So, if we can track down Shan,

266
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,910
we might prevent the prophecy
from unfolding.

267
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,450
That way, we won't be
on the back foot in Chang'an.

268
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,510
Exactly.

269
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,070
This is also my chance to see

270
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,200
whether the Mandate of Heaven
can be altered.

271
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,170
When I have you,

272
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,510
it's like my grandfather's
great-grandfather

273
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,800
had Zhang Liang.

274
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,240
You could just call him Emperor Gaozu.

275
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,670
- What?
- I'm leaving.

276
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,150
Hey, where are you going?

277
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,270
We're short on time.

278
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,580
I'll get De Jiu and Qingge
to split up and search.

279
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,000
Perhaps Shan

280
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,600
is right here in the city.

281
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,800
Well.

282
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,720
What about me?

283
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,470
You?

284
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,030
As the origin of the Mandate of Heaven,

285
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,120
you're very important.

286
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,030
Just stay put.

287
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,600
Lord Wang.

288
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,320
There's no one named Shan in this area.

289
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,270
Try searching further west.

290
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,600
Many thanks, sir.

291
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,630
I shall take my leave.

292
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,200
Are you Mr. Wang Heng?

293
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,720
You're looking for me?

294
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,990
Someone named Shan

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,150
wishes to meet you.

296
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,000
But he can't show himself.

297
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,330
Here's the address.
