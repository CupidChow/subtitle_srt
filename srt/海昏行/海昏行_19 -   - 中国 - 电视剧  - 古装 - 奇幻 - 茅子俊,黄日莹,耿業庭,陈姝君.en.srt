=Episode 19=

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,560
Lord Zhang often praised Bingyi.

31
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,590
He wished to marry his granddaughter to him.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,250
But his brother, Zhang Anshi, stopped him.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
He said,

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,310
Bingyi is the son of Crown Prince Wei.

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,050
Being able to live as a commoner

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,280
is already a blessing for him.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,920
Do not speak of marriage again.

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,120
But as fate would have it,

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,000
your daughter Xu Pingjun was to be wed,

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
yet the marriage never happened.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,220
With Lord Zhang as matchmaker,

42
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,400
in Yuanfeng Year 6,

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,790
Bingyi and Pingjun were wed.

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,630
Lord Wang,

45
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,140
you've never been to Chang'an,

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,840
so how do you know about all this?

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,070
I simply know what I know.

48
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,480
It's the Mandate of Heaven.

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,590
Do you recall when your wife brought

50
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,960
Pingjun to seek a divination?

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,480
Wasn't it said she'd have great fortune?

52
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,630
I never told anyone of this matter.

53
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,710
I know what you know

54
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,440
and even

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,620
what you shouldn't know.

56
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,710
Now the chance stands before you.

57
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,910
Remove Huo Guang from power,

58
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,910
and the Wucheng Village will be well treated.

59
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,360
Then Pingjun will live a good life,

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,390
and of course, Bingyi as well.

61
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,910
He will be granted
a fief and a royal title.

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,240
Lord Zhang's spirit in heaven

63
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,450
will surely be pleased to see all this.

64
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
After so many years,

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,840
Crown Prince Wei's wrongful fate

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
can finally be set right.

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,190
Lord Zhang's hopes for Bingyi

68
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,520
should now be fulfilled.

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
Lord Wang,

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,870
I will pass the message along.

71
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,240
Please, return now.

72
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,360
Lord Xu, I shall take my leave.

73
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,550
It seems,

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,190
that the Qi Chang I met
in Wucheng Village

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,280
was the Crown Prince Liu He,

76
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,960
my own uncle.

77
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,240
This Wang Heng

78
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,360
is truly a man touched by the divine.

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
Mandate of Heaven...

80
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,910
How intriguing.

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,400
Tomorrow,

82
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll head to Wucheng Village.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,860
Bingyi.

84
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Are you serious?

85
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,370
For the sake of Grandfather,

86
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,680
everyone's suffered just to keep me safe.

87
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,910
I want to do something for all of you.

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,590
(Thankfully, my ex is a tour guide)

89
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,960
(of the Han Dynasty Museum.)

90
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,030
(At least I still remember that much.)

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
What matters now is

92
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,600
to come up with a new plan.

93
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,280
How could we make Huo Guang agree

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,600
to let me lead a large group
out of the city?

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,490
Forget it.

96
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,590
Let's call it a day.

97
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,310
I'll go rest now.

98
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,780
I have to oversee
the funeral ceremony tomorrow.

99
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,840
Have you memorized all the formalities?

100
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,960
Yes, I've got them all down.

101
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,910
Don't worry, you should also rest early.

102
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,100
(74 BC,)

103
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,800
(Duke of Changyi,
already named Crown Prince,)

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,550
(presided over
the grand funeral of Liu Fuling)

105
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,020
(the eighth Emperor of Western Han Dynasty,)

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,590
(at Pingling, 70 li northwest of Chang'an.)

107
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,630
Lord Huo,

108
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,160
I've yet

109
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,670
to inherit the throne.

110
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,220
It's not proper to reside in the Palace.

111
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,560
This is my filial respect
to the Late Emperor.

112
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,600
Today, you observed every courtesy,

113
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,630
leaving nothing amiss.

114
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,090
The bearing of an Emperor is taking shape.

115
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,040
Good.

116
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,560
There are still two ceremonies ahead.

117
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,270
Hope you'll diligently practice the rites

118
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,430
and strive for perfection.

119
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,310
You've worked hard today.

120
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,950
Rest early.

121
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,070
I shall take my leave now.

122
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Lord Huo.

123
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,730
There is one more favor.

124
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,470
Oh?

125
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,270
Earlier at Weiyang Palace,

126
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,480
upon seeing the Late Emperor's coffin,

127
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,310
I felt great grief.

128
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,880
The sight brought sorrow anew.

129
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,820
It made me realize I haven't

130
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,390
paid my respects
to my grandfather, Emperor Wu.

131
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,410
I truly feel deep shame for this.

132
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,510
Moreover, Emperor Wu

133
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,590
is also the role model for Changyi people.

134
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,070
Our admiration for him is beyond words.

135
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,010
You're so understanding and virtuous,

136
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,570
truly a mark of filial rule.

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,700
This is all thanks to having wise ministers

138
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,160
like Lord Gong to guide you.

139
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
You have worked hard.

140
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,480
You flatter me, Lord Huo.

141
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,680
Assisting the Duke is simply my duty.

142
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,630
Lord Huo.

143
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,050
About our plan to pay respects,

144
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,320
can it be carried out?

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,260
You show the utmost virtue
and filial piety.

146
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,480
I did not think it through carefully

147
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
and failed to make proper arrangements.

148
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,670
Indeed,

149
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,010
Emperor Wu was the foundation
of our dynasty.

150
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,360
As his heir to the throne,

151
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,680
you should pay your respects

152
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,830
to show your filial devotion.

153
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,630
It is only right to do so.

154
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,350
Very well.

155
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,630
Then I shall take my leave, Duke.

156
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you, Great General.

157
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,180
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

158
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,830
Brilliant.

159
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,670
Oh,

160
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,510
just a small clever move.

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,480
Nothing worth mentioning.

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,310
What did Huo Guang say?

163
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,870
"Duke, you've shown

164
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,160
the utmost virtue and filial piety.

165
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,850
I did not think it through carefully

166
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,800
and failed to make proper arrangements.

167
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,750
Indeed, Emperor Xiaowu…"

168
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,510
- Oh, everyone's here.
- Lord Gong.

169
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,880
I brought some fruit for Lord Wang.

170
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,660
You can share it together.

171
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,760
Ah, many thanks, Lord Gong.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
My pleasure.

173
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,070
Back to the topic.

174
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,590
Huo Guang will inspect the armies tomorrow.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,750
I'll be there with the other generals.

176
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,290
I'll take this opportunity

177
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,210
to proceed with our plan
to switch the men.

178
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,950
A word from my martial uncle,

179
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,950
everything is ready.

180
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,600
Tomorrow, we act as planned.

181
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,310
They'll replace your men
and enter the Palace.

182
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,240
The day after tomorrow
is the military meeting.

183
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,950
We stick to the original plan.

184
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,600
Seize Huo Guang in the passageway.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Mm.

186
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,950
Upon your signal,

187
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,230
I'll take down Huo Guang,

188
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,240
then go to the armory.

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,000
Cut their reinforcements off completely.

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Alright.

191
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,160
I'll have the Empress Dowager set out early

192
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
to Chengming Hall.

193
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,240
Once you've caught Huo Guang,

194
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
she'll condemn him.

195
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,110
Good.

196
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,150
It's a perfect chance.

197
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,840
Act in one decisive strike.

198
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,280
Let's do this.

199
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,550
In my hometown,

200
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,750
we place our hands together

201
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
and shout out: Go for it.

202
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,510
It means when together,

203
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,710
we're unstoppable.

204
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,000
What does "go for it" mean?

205
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,840
To lift our spirits.

206
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,560
Come on.

207
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
Follow my lead.

208
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,960
One, two, three.

209
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,080
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

210
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,430
Alright.

211
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,790
You have heavy duties ahead.

212
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,390
So rest early tonight.

213
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
Time to sleep.

214
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,260
(Nine)

215
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,160
I strained my neck?

216
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,000
- Lord Wang.
- Coming.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll go over myself.

218
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,350
Please.

219
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,030
Lord Wang,

220
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,350
you're up so early.

221
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,750
Of course.

222
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,750
Morning, Lord Huo.

223
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,840
You... what happened there?

224
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,000
Reporting to milord,

225
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,730
I woke up with a stiff neck.

226
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Oh.

227
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,960
Lord Huo,

228
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
after you.

229
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,790
Go ahead.

230
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
Go on.

231
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,440
Go on.

232
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Same as always.

233
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,630
Good morning, generals.

234
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,190
- General Zhang, General Fan.
- Morning.

235
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,110
General Han, General Zhao.

236
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,600
Morning, generals.

237
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,470
You...

238
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,770
- Come on.
- (What's going on?)

239
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,750
Everyone, have a seat.

240
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,080
(They don't seem to know me.)

241
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,200
Come on.

242
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,510
Sit.

243
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,280
Generals,

244
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,390
the Late Emperor's burial is at hand.

245
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,500
The New Sovereign is to
ascend the throne.

246
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,810
- We must tighten
- (Why is it)

247
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,410
- the guards.
- (the same as before?)

248
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,490
(Just like the first day.)

249
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,600
(Wrong memory?)

250
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,220
The first matter is

251
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,600
the defense arrangements
for the Duke's entry.

252
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,000
I propose our elite troops be split

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,480
into inner and outer groups.

254
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
The outer one patrols around the city.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,820
- The other guards the city.
- (I'm not dead.)

256
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,140
(Where did it all go wrong?)

257
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,550
I will also set up covert sentries

258
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,200
to handle sudden incidents.

259
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,240
I propose to survey the route in advance

260
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,630
and clear all obstacles along the way.

261
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,630
Ensure the roads remain unimpeded.

262
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,030
In my humble opinion,

263
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,370
we should send a scout team
to lead the way

264
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,750
and sweep for potential threats.

265
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,000
(Five, four, three, two, one.)

266
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,960
Please continue.

267
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll be right back.

268
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,620
Wait a moment, Lord Huo.

269
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,360
Today,

270
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
aren't we heading to inspect the Armies?

271
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,990
Dead...

272
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,750
How exactly did I die?

273
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,200
The first matter is the defense...

274
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,560
Greetings, I'm Yan Yannian.

275
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,650
The Duke of Changyi has arrived.
Before the funeral,

276
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,120
eat well and take care of your health.

277
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,770
Who can keep you safe when I'm not here?

278
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,080
Heng,

279
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,600
aren't we doing it?

280
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,960
Mm.

281
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,680
Alright.

282
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,230
Go for it!

283
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,510
Get some sleep.

284
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,350
Let's go.

285
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,260
(Nine)

286
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,080
Lord Gong.

287
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Instead of assisting the Duke

288
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,240
to uphold the way of a sovereign,

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,860
you let the Duke risk himself in danger.

290
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,660
Thus you cannot come and go freely,

291
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,910
nor drink and enjoy yourself as before.

292
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,350
Lord Wang.

293
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,360
Huo Guang will inspect the Armies tomorrow.

294
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,480
I'll be there with the other generals.

295
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,280
- Lord Gong.
- All here.

296
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,920
I brought some fruit to Lord Wang.

297
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,270
You can share it.

298
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,160
Lord Gong.

299
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,390
It's a misunderstanding.

300
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,950
I will see you knave executed.
