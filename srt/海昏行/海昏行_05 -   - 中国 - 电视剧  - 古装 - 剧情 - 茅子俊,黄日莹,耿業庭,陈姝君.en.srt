=Episode 5=

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,700
How much are you
selling this ticket for?

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,640
Twice

32
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,760
the original price.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,810
That's steep.

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,070
This is a VVIP ticket.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
It lets you stand high

36
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,310
to share the thrill of departure
and victory with the Duke.

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,950
Only a select few can be up there.

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,760
I took huge risks to get it.

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,920
This is already a bargain.

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,790
And it's the last one left.

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,040
You booked 30 horses
and still couldn't get a ticket?

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll take this ticket.

43
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,200
Sorry.

44
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,000
The ticket is gone.

45
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,030
Come on, leave.

46
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,030
I told you to buy earlier.

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,680
Not bad, young man.

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,280
All thanks to your guidance.

49
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,400
I have a question for you.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
I'm not deceiving the Duke.

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm the event organizer.

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,370
Holding back premium tickets
for scalpers is common practice.

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,810
I just want to ask.

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,590
I help you sell tickets.

55
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,470
Why call me a scalper?

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Well.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,960
Your scalp

58
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,120
looks good,

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,130
and you work well for me.

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,580
So, you're a scalper.

61
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,430
Understood.

62
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,520
Then I'll be called Scalp Wang.

63
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
What?

64
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,190
(Scalp Wang)
I grew up without a name.

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,120
It's my greatest honor
to take your surname.

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Well.

67
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,440
Anyway, helping me sell tickets
stays between us.

68
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,240
No one else can know.

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,110
Do you understand?

70
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,980
Of course.

71
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,360
No one knows except my brother.

72
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,630
Your brother?

73
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,550
Yes.

74
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,150
My brother and I have had no parents.

75
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,990
We've depended on each other to survive.

76
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,360
You've given us clothes to wear,

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,490
food to eat,

78
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,490
and even some money.

79
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,550
Rest assured.

80
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,170
We will never betray you.

81
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,090
Hey, little brother.

82
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,010
My brother's here.

83
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,000
He's your brother?

84
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,150
Yes, he's my brother.

85
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,590
He's too old to be your brother.

86
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,910
I can hardly believe it.

87
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,610
He's looked like this
since he was eight.

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,650
Ha ha ha.

89
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,770
I didn't expect to see Lord Wang here.

90
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,030
Brother.

91
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,120
I have a name now.

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,470
I took the master's surname.

93
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,810
I'm called Scalp Wang.

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,370
That's a fine name.

95
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,220
I'll take the surname Wang, too.

96
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,120
(Horse Wang)
I'll be Horse Wang.

97
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,310
Why don't you two pick different names?

98
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,960
We're to serve you.

99
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,080
We're not changing names.

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,940
Don't.

101
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,030
You're making me look
like a slave owner.

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
How about this?

103
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,200
From this day on,

104
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,750
I'll be your personal VVIP.

105
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,310
The race is tomorrow.

106
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,340
Give it your best shot.

107
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,170
- Alright.
- Got it.

108
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,080
It's finally starting.

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
We almost missed it.

110
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,320
- I know, right?
- How lively.

111
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,660
(Changyi)

112
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,860
(Li's Pastries, Li's Rouge)

113
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,020
(Li, Official Sponsor)

114
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,860

115

(Shuyue Books)

117
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,140
(Changyi Li)

118
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,090
Alright, ladies.

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,400
Please, upstairs.

120
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,990
They're from the Western Regions?

121
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,480
It proves the influence
of our equine administration.

122
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,720
Once it becomes
an annual cultural festival,

123
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,630
the food and lodging in Changyi,

124
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,660
along with travel,
can all raise their prices.

125
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,030
This is called

126
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Equine Administration Cultural Tourism.

127
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,500
I don't get it.

128
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,410
(As if you ever would.)

129
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,510
The race is about to start.

130
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,380
Hurry and get ready.

131
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,270
Mm.

132
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,020
Great!

133
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,040
Riders, take your positions.

134
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,160
Ready.

135
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,390
Go, go, go!

136
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,230
Three.

137
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,440
Two.

138
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
One.

139
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,350
Go!

140
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
Hyah!

141
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,710
Hyah!

142
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,270
After all the bond we've built,

143
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,800
how can you falter now?

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,310
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Hyah!

146
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,510
What a fine-looking horse!

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,300
Hey, everyone!

148
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
In this equestrian match,

149
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,630
the top three winners

150
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,520
will not only earn a handsome reward

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,750
but also face off
against a mystery rider.

152
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,100
Let's wait and see!

153
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,870
Hyah!

154
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,240
Look, here they come!

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
Hyah!

156
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,760
First place goes

157
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,720
to Xu Qingge!

158
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,270
Well done!

159
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,010
- Hurry!
- Good!

160
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
Hyah!

161
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,560
Hurry up! Aren't you embarrassed?

162
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,950
Come on, faster!

163
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
Ah!

164
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,950
Brother!

165
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,020
(Li Nvxu)

166
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,880
(What's going on?)

167
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,120
Brother!

168
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
(Again?)

169
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,420
(11th day of the 6th month, 74 BC)

170
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,500
(10th day of the 6th month, 74 BC)

171
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,190
Riders, take your positions.

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,070
Three.

173
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,260
Two.

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,510
One.

175
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,950
Go!

176
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,360
What happened?

177
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,120
What's going on?

178
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
Lord Wang!

179
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,630
What's the matter?

180
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,720
Wake up! Lord Wang!

181
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,060
(Qingge Tavern)

182
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,910
Heng.

183
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,760
Heng!

184
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,440
Heng, wake up.

185
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,750
See? I told you not to train so hard.

186
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,390
Now, you've passed out.

187
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,460
Someone's after your life.

188
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
- Wait.
- Step aside.

189
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,020
Who dares to kill me here?

190
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,090
Wang Heng, I'm telling you.

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Wang Heng!

192
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,180
What's with that attitude?

193
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,310
Can't you hear me?

194
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,340
I'm trying to protect you.

195
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Step aside.

196
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,510
Wang Heng, stop!

197
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,390
I can't stand it
when people don't answer me.

198
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,240
I did answer.

199
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,600
Oh? Then tell me what I just asked.

200
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,510
It doesn't matter.

201
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,510
Life comes first.

202
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,750
Hurry to the finish line.

203
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,920
Qingge is going to win.

204
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,830
Qingge?

205
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,670
Believe it or not.

206
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,990
Qingge can claim the first place?

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,630
Wang, your ticket.

208
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
I'm already your VVIP.

209
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,610
Why would I need a ticket?

210
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520
Step aside.

211
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,300
Have you seen a Western Regions girl?

212
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,320
No.

213
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,850
Have you seen a Western Regions girl?

214
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,050
I think she was here just now.

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,600
Wang Heng.

216
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,720
Are you deaf or something?

217
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,680
Stay put by the guards.

218
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,000
Just do as I say.

219
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
Wang Heng.

220
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,430
Here they come.

221
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,550
She's riding so fast.

222
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,630
First place!

223
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,290
Qingge.

224
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,800
This round's champion.

225
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,720
The winner is

226
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,600
Xu Qingge!

227
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,120
Wang Heng called it right.

228
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,820
Hey.

229
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,350
Where did the Western Regions girl go?

230
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,660
She headed that way.

231
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,020
(Qingge Tavern)

232
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,150
Hey.

233
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,000
Isn't that the rich young lady

234
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,630
who bought the VVIP ticket?

235
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,030
So, that's the kind of girl you like.

236
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,180
She's the one who wants you dead.

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm an honest, upright man.

238
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,260
I do good deeds.

239
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,320
I have no enemies.

240
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,630
Who'd want to kill me?

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Humph.

242
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,950
Do you even believe that yourself?

243
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Even if you doubt it, I believe in it.

244
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Enough with the pointless talk.

245
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,720
Did you find it or not?

246
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,960
Of course, I did.

247
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,460
You like her, after all.

248
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,910
Are you asking for a beating?

249
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,510
Everything you asked for
has been taken care of.

250
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,020
But what we should do right now

251
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,670
is celebrate Qingge's victory.

252
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,910
I emptied the whole wine cellar

253
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,920
just to find this bottle.

254
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,390
- Duke.
- It has quite a history.

255
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,750
- Melon.
- Oh, my.

256
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,030
Fine wine indeed.

257
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,790
At this very moment,

258
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,440
in a setting like this,

259
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,600
it's perfect to open
this bottle of Jiuyun Wine

260
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,030
from the Era of Tianhan.

261
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,270
The Era of Tianhan?

262
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,150
That's something

263
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,010
like a Lafite

264
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,940
from '82.

265
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,870
Lafite?

266
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,940
A Lafite from '82?

267
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,990
Oh.

268
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
It means

269
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,360
it's precious.

270
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,750
Oh.

271
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,020
The year '82.

272
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
Very rare.

273
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
Go ask your father

274
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,020
- if he has any '82 medicine.
- Spare me!

275
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,550
Li Qi, pay up.

276
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,720
- Stop hitting me, help!
- Pay up.

277
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
Hey, Heng.

278
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,270
Weren't you just leaving?

279
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,470
Why are you back?

280
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,030
We need to talk.

281
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,120
What's the matter?

282
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,860
At your race tomorrow,

283
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,480
put on this outfit.

284
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
Didn't I faint today?

285
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,690
How can I still join the finals?

286
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,390
Because you are the mystery rider.

287
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,990
Me?

288
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,890
I've thought about it for a long time

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,330
and only came up with this plan.

290
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,680
You want to meet the Duke, right?

291
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,030
But you'll be sent in as the organizer.

292
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,330
Otherwise, you would've been eliminated.

293
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,590
How would you meet the Duke?

294
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,000
You really thought it through.

295
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,230
Close the door.

296
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,230
Alright.

297
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,820
Heng, give it your all tomorrow.

298
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,140
Come on.

299
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,150
Have you seen him before?

300
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,870
- No.
- Good.

301
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,680
Give it your all.

302
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,680
They're in the finals.

303
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,360
Miss Xu.

304
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,120
(The mystery rider
representing the organizer.)

305
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,390
(What an impressive scene.)

306
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,200
(Liu He is just so-so.)

307
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,500
(I wonder where he is watching from.)

308
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,960
(I must give my very best.)

309
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,360
The first "Changyi Riders"

310
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,960
"Racing with the Wind".

311
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,870
The finals

312
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,980
begin now.

313
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,840
Riders, take your positions.

314
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,910
Come on!

315
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,550
Secure your saddles.

316
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,240
Sound the drum thrice.

317
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
Three.

318
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,510
Two.

319
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,730
One.

320
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,300
Begin!

321
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,990
- Charge!
- Got it!

322
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,270
Hyah!

323
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,430
Run!

324
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,440
Wait. Where's the Duke?

325
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,840
I saw him before the race started.

326
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,340
Hyah!

327
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,840
Hyah!

328
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,510
Hyah!

329
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,080
Your plan is truly brilliant.

330
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,030
I finally understand
why you seemed distant

331
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,910
and aloof before.

332
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,720
So, you trust me the most.

333
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,080
We're out. Can you be quiet now?

334
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,120
Shut your mouth.

335
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,120
I'm excited.

336
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,390
I'm not as free as you.

337
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,080
Someone's always watching me.

338
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,390
I don't like being watched over.

339
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,720
I'm no royalty or nobility

340
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,850
who grew up in comfort and luxury.

341
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,850
Commoners like us

342
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,750
take life's beatings day after day.

343
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,840
I am Wang Heng.

344
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,240
A pleasure working with you.

345
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,390
When you climbed the wall,

346
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,220
you finally looked like an Immortal.

347
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,840
With so much money beside me,

348
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,960
I could rest in peace with a smile.

349
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,600
You must've fallen from the heavens.

350
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,390
Aren't you an Immortal?

351
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,720
How could you not foresee this?

352
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm just indulging you out of joy.

353
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,910
We'll slip away from Changyi,

354
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,950
ride together to Chang'an,

355
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,700
reclaim the Qilin,

356
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,810
and see our wish fulfilled.

357
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,910
Wouldn't that be thrilling?

358
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,700
Great!

359
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,430
Whoa.

360
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,780
Wait for me here.

361
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,510
Duke, where are you going?

362
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,510
Run!

363
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,390
Come on!

364
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,480
So fast!

365
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,360
Run!

366
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,270
Hyah! Hyah!

367
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,620
What mystery rider?

368
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,120
Look at the decorations on that horse.

369
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,970
It's the Duke.

370
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,080
It's pretty obvious.

371
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,900
Let's give him way.

372
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,920
Let him have his moment.

373
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,150
His pace is far too slow.

374
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,630
Going slow is so hard.

375
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,080
And I have to make it look natural.

376
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,840
Nothing we can do.

377
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,930
He is the Duke, after all.

378
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,840
Just bear with it.

379
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,440
Hyah!

380
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,910
Hyah! Hyah!

381
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,960
Here they come.

382
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,320
The first place has arrived.

383
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,590
Good.

384
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,630
Alright, everyone, let's cheer together.

385
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,030
(As the organizer's rider,)

386
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,960
(I cheated,)

387
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,150
(but the rivals were too obvious.)

388
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,550
(It was still all about connections.)

389
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,440
Good.

390
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,030
Let's congratulate

391
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,210
the champion of today's race,

392
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,240
Duke of Changyi,

393
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,840
His Highness Liu He.

394
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,730
(Duke of Changyi?)

395
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,390
Duke of Changyi.

396
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,560
Duke of Changyi!

397
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,950
Duke of Changyi.

398
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,160
Duke of Changyi!

399
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,270
Duke of Changyi.

400
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,290
Duke of Changyi!

401
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,060
Duke of Changyi.

402
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,220
The imperial decree is here.

403
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,480
Where is the Duke?

404
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,910
This is not the Duke.

405
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,080
What should we do?

406
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,120
For now, keep this quiet.

407
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,000
Duke of Changyi,

408
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,100
Liu He, receive the decree.

409
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,670
(The imperial decree is here.)

410
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,670
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,
is summoned to the capital.

411
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,920
Lord Shi.

412
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,750
This is of great importance.

413
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,550
Accepting it here
might seem lacking in decorum.

414
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,750
Please allow us to return

415
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,750
to the Changyi Palace

416
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,750
for the Acceptance Ceremony.

417
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,710
Well.

418
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,800
That works.

419
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,480
(It seems His Majesty has passed.)

420
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,510
(Where is Liu He?)

421
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,710
(He must be scared out of his wits.)

422
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,030
(It's good for him to be the Emperor.)

423
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,470
(See you next time.)

424
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,510
Hyah!

425
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,390
The Duke has likely fled.

426
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,250
Hurry.

427
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,850
Find someone and bring him back at once.

428
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,720
Or the consequences
will be unimaginable.

429
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,960
Yes.

430
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,240
You, go as well.

431
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,080
Yes.

432
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,000
No sign of the Duke
in the east of the city.

433
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,880
Nor in the south.

434
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,980
We've searched the entire race route
for the day.

435
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,030
No news so far.

436
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,720
Search again.

437
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,910
Yes.

438
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,800
Milord.

439
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,030
The Chang'an Envoy
has been properly arranged.

440
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,460
But the imperial decree is pressing.

441
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,750
The time must not be delayed.

442
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,750
The Duke should go at once
to accept the decree.

443
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,720
In that case,

444
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,030
go and tell them

445
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,030
to rest

446
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,030
after a long journey.

447
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,550
The Duke will be here soon.

448
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Yes.

449
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,270
We've searched everywhere
the Duke frequents.

450
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,340
Dragging on like this
won't solve anything.

451
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,350
The Duke has gone missing.

452
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,400
If word of this leaks out,

453
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,310
all his subordinates

454
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,240
and all the people will be in danger.

455
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,750
At this point,

456
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,420
we have to take the risk.

457
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,560
Qi Chang.

458
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,680
I truly don't know where he's gone.

459
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,630
Lord Wang.

460
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,160
I need a favor from you.

461
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,720
Liu He, Duke of Changyi.

462
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,790
By imperial edict,

463
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,790
Lecheng, Grand Herald,
De, Minister of Imperial Clan,

464
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,440
Bingji, Imperial Advisor,

465
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,310
Li Han, Imperial Guard Commander,

466
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,750
are here to bring you to Chang'an

467
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,830
in a seven-horse carriage.

468
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,030
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,
accept the decree.

469
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,160
I,

470
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,510
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,

471
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,710
have listened to the will of Heaven

472
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,120
and knelt to accept the decree.

473
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,160
Duke,

474
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,310
you should prepare

475
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,610

of the late Emperor.
