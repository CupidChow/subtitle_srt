30
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,830
- Duke.
- How is it?

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,430
No sign of him in the north or south.

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,140
Li Qi has gone out of the city
to search.

33
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,430
Duke.

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,340
Well?

35
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,560
Nothing in the west either.

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,000
Search again.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,710
Comb through all of Hongnong
if you must.

38
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,550
Yes.

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,560
Duke, what has happened?

40
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,350
Wang Heng is missing.

41
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,730
Did you search the whole area?

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,630
He didn't come back last night.

43
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,160
Duke, I searched
all over the east of the city.

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,430
Still no sign of Heng.

45
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,100
Lord Wang is usually very cautious.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,310
He should be fine.

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,580
Duke.

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,900
Lord Shi is seething with anger.

49
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,910
He urgently needs you.

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,290
What a strong smell of wine.

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,310
How could Lord Wang be like this?

52
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,150
Lord Shi.

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,440
What's the matter?

54
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,400
You'll know once you see it.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,640
Heng.

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
Heng.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,190
Wake up!

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,710
Wake up.

59
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,280
Wake up!

60
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,250
Such disgrace.

61
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,030
Lord Wang,

62
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,080
you're in such high spirits
during the mourning period.

63
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,800
This is a setup.

64
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,470
Duke, Lord Shi,

65
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,030
please judge with clear sight.

66
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,880
Milord.

67
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,840
Yesterday, Lord Wang saved me

68
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
and escorted my sister and me home.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
He is our savior.

70
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,440
Last night,

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,750
Lord Wang suddenly came

72
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,020
and said we should ride
and drink together.

73
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,030
Out of courtesy,

74
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,010
my sister and I agreed.

75
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,030
But unexpectedly,

76
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,730
something was slipped into our drinks.

77
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,630
When I woke up,

78
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,560
we were already inside the carriage.

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,470
Wang Heng, how dare you

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,470
tarnish the Duke of Changyi's name
during mourning

81
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,750
by committing such shameless acts!

82
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,840
Both witnesses and evidence are here.

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,010
What else do you have to say?

84
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,020
Using indecent means
to bring someone down

85
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,870
has always been the most efficient way.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,960
Words are useless now.

87
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,080
I have been framed.

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
Humph.

89
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,570
Take care of these two ladies.

90
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,890
Once the truth is uncovered,

91
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,000
they will be given justice.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,960
- Guards.
- Yes.

93
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Wait.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,290
He works for me.

95
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,260
What right do you have to interfere?

96
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,790
Sorry.

97
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,360
Lord Shi, you uphold the law
with strict fairness.

98
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,750
You have my respect.

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,930
But rest assured.

100
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,950
If one of us commits

101
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,870
such disgraceful conduct,

102
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,380
we won't let it go unpunished.

103
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,190
By law, he should be detained
and questioned at once.

104
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,830
Guards!

105
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

106
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,560
Take Wang Heng away.

107
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,830
Lord Gong.

108
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,750
You two should head back first.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
Yes.

110
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,270
Lord Gong,

111
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,720
I said I would handle this myself.

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,170
Why did you lock him up again?

113
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,910
Duke,

114
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,090
the officials from Chang'an are here.

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,630
Every word and action of yours
is under their watch.

116
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,140
About what happened to Lord Wang today,

117
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,160
they caught him red-handed.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,400
If you insist on shielding him,

119
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,840
how will the officials see it?

120
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,840
They will surely think
you are bending the law for him.

121
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,720
But Wang Heng must have been wronged.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,870
I know that.

123
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,720
Lord Wang would never do such a thing.

124
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,480
Right now,
the priority is to find evidence,

125
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,240
so we can help Lord Wang clear his name.

126
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,050
Also,

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,640
to keep Lord Wang in custody,

128
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,000
our men are more reassuring

129
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,430
than those from Chang'an, right?

130
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,040
That being said,

131
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,190
as long as Heng's name isn't cleared,

132
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,390
I won't go anywhere.

133
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,160
Don't be reckless.

134
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,460
This isn't recklessness.

135
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,830
It's loyalty.

136
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,870
How could I abandon a friend in need?

137
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,600
You must not act rashly.

138
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,140
Countless eyes are watching.

139
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,310
I know.

140
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,260
I'll move quietly.

141
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,130
I won't alert the enemy.

142
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,420
Hey, Senior.

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,200
Senior, where are you going?

144
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
Who is there?

145
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
Yes.

146
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,270
Duke.

147
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,270
Open the door.

148
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,240
You may all leave.

149
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,190
- Yes.
- Yes.

150
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,840
Have you suffered?

151
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,560
Thanks to Lord Gong,

152
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,200
he had our own men watching over me,

153
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,840
so I wasn't harmed.

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh, right.

155
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,220
Last night,

156
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,030
what exactly did you do?

157
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,660
(Wine)

158
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
Then I blacked out.

159
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,600
You know what happened when I woke up.

160
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,430
It was this place.

161
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,040
Tavern at the East Market in the city.

162
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,610
What kind of evidence

163
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,920
is this?

164
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,930
It's the only thing
that can prove my innocence.

165
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
It can help us find Shan.

166
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,160
Bring me

167
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,000
the bamboo slips from the last exam.

168
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,160
Bamboo slips?

169
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

170
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Who are you?

171
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,150
Stay back.

172
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,630
What do you want?

173
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,670
I received an order.

174
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
My apologies.

175
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Stop right there.

176
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,480
You're walking right into my hands.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
You alone

178
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,410
may not win against me.

179
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,840
Can handwriting really be recognized?

180
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,880
If the writing material is different,

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,270
the pressure of the brushstroke
can also differ.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
Bamboo slips are smooth and even.

183
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,390
But they're narrow and slender.

184
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,840
The characters tend to be slimmer.

185
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,140
Wooden tablets and silk strips

186
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,040
have a rougher surface.

187
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,520
When writing on them,
to keep the ink flowing smoothly,

188
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,630
you'd need to press harder.

189
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,160
The brush tip would also feel sharper.

190
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,870
However,

191
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,040
the writer's overall style
remains the same.

192
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
What habits does he have?

193
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,030
His strokes are steady and weighty,

194
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,000
yet the structure of his characters
is on the thin side.

195
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,640
When starting a horizontal line,

196
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,420
the stroke tends
to lift upward slightly.

197
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,010
When making a rightward pressing stroke,

198
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,870
it rises a little as well.

199
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,860
Heng.

200
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Come a bit closer.

201
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,800
That's him.

202
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,380
(Tavern at the East Market in the city)

203
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,040
Chen really shouldn't have done this.

204
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,730
Do you think Heng
might have made a mistake?

205
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,510
Isn't this handwriting comparison
far too sloppy?

206
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,120
It's indeed hardly convincing.

207
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,630
Senior.

208
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,760
- Guards!
- Keep it quiet.

209
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,510
Help me out first.

210
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,670
Senior.

211
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,510
Where did you rescue her from?

212
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,400
From the hands of the one
who killed my master.

213
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,130
You might have seen him before.

214
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,030
What's his background?

215
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
Didn't Wang Heng tell you?

216
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,240
He's with the court.

217
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
Other than me,

218
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,550
there must be other spies around you.

219
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,890
Is it

220
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,660
really Chen Bushi?

221
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,390
She only has a few scrapes.

222
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,900
She might also have been frightened.

223
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,840
Nothing serious for now.

224
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,230
Duke.

225
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,850
We brought you some Lubing.

226
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,790
Join us for a bite.

227
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,910
If it truly is Chen,

228
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,670
I have a way to test him.

229
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,790
I'm just not sure if it's proper.

230
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,270
I asked you here today

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,560
because there's something to tell you.

232
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,400
What is it?

233
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,230
It concerns Lord Wang's wrongful case.

234
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,260
Those two women we met today...

235
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,130
What about them?

236
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,010
They were attacked by an assassin.

237
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,470
Did they die?

238
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,220
Thankfully,

239
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,570
they were saved.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Is that so?

241
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,000
However,

242
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
her wounds were too severe,

243
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
and she fainted.

244
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,890
But before she lost consciousness,

245
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,480
she managed to say one thing.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
What did she say?

247
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,230
She said

248
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,600
that the one who framed Lord Wang

249
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,640
is hidden among us.

250
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,790
No way.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
Among us?

252
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
I trust

253
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,630
the three of you the most.

254
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,440
Your job is to take turns
protecting her.

255
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
When she wakes up,

256
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,240
I'll question her myself.

257
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,260
You can count on us, Qi.

258
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,940
(Lodge)

259
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,600
Chen Bushi.

260
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
Stop.

261
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,240
What's wrong?

262
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,030
Why are you here so early?

263
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh, I couldn't sleep,
so I might as well do something.

264
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,070
You should get some rest early.

265
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,190
You're the thoughtful one.

266
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,590
I'll bring you Lubing tomorrow.

267
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,310
Alright.

268
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,210
Keep a good watch.

269
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,110
Go on.

270
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,280
