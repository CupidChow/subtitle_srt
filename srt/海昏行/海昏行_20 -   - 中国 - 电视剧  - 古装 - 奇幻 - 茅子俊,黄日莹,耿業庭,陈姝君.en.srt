30
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,740
Lord Gong,

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,960
it's a misunderstanding.

32
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,740
I will see you knave executed.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,470
(This cursed time reset.)

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,230
(It's of little use.)

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,870
(If I still can't get the Qilin,)

36
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,510
(I'll end up rotting here,)

37
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,590
(with not even a tombstone to my name.)

38
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,430
Lord Wang.

39
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,470
Lord Wang.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Lord Wang.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,150
Tell Lord Huo,

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
I really

43
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,150
can't make it today.

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
Lord Wang.

45
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,300
(Bashang Post Station)

46
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,430
Search every corner.

47
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,470
Check thoroughly.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,890
Without Wang Heng,

49
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,910
I won't head to Chang'an.

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
How is it?

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Well...

52
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,270
Duke,

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,840
Grand Herald Wei Xian has arrived.

54
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,400
Why haven't you set out yet?

55
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,720
Lord Gong,

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,940
Wang Heng is missing again.

57
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,000
I fear he may have run into trouble.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,060
Duke.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,920
We've found him.

60
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,870
Wang.

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,310
Duke.

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,000
- Heng.
- Duke.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,910
Heng.

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,870
Heng.

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,400
What happened to you?

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,310
Listen carefully,

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
all my plans are written on this.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,150
You must follow it exactly.

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Alright.

70
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,710
Li Qi.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,030
Summon the physician.

72
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,870
Yes.

73
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,990
I'm fine.

74
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,360
Hear me out.

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,800
Not a single task can be left undone.

76
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,470
Above all else,

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
go to the Inner Court

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,910
to seek out Xu Guanghan.

79
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,350
What to do

80
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,310
and what to say

81
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,680
are written on the cloth.

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,040
You must follow it exactly.

83
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,070
What?

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,400
Aside from De Jiu and Qingge,

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,760
no one else must know our plan,

86
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,080
especially not Gong Sui.

87
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,200
Heng.

88
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,430
What's wrong?

89
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,800
What on earth happened?

90
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,830
Lord Gong is a man of great virtue.

91
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,880
Mandate of Heaven says he'll be fine.

92
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,120
But do not tell him this.

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,260
We must protect the rest of our brothers.

94
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,320
Never forget this,

95
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,710
when I wake up…

96
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,400
Wang Heng.

97
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,590
Wang Heng!

98
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,730
Li Qi!

99
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,590
Where are you?

100
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,270
Wang Heng.

101
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,500
(One month later)

102
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,460
(July 18, 74 BC, 1st Day
of the 6th Month, Yuanping Year 1)

103
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,630
(Weiyang Palace, July 74 BC)

104
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,190
(The blazing sun casts a golden glow
over the hall.)

105
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,870
(Liu He receives the imperial seal
amidst the ceremonial music,)

106
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,600
(becoming the ninth Emperor
of the Western Han.)

107
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,730
(As the adopted son of the Late Emperor,)

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,240
(he posthumously honors the Late Emperor
as Emperor Zhao)

109
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,790
(and bestows the title of Empress Dowager
upon Empress Shangguan.)

110
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,190
His virtue embraces all the people.

111
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,530
His grace will bless generations to come.

112
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,600
Thus, Duke of Changyi, Liu He, is enthroned.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hereby,

114
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,190
it is proclaimed to all under Heaven

115
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
and spread to every household.

116
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,950
Kneel.

117
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,750
Bow.

118
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,070
Long live the Emperor.

119
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,440
Bow again.

120
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,160
Long live.

121
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,170
- (As the court roared "Long live",)
- Three bows.

122
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,680
(their cries swept the gilded eaves,)

123
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,780
Long live the Emperor.

124
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,000
(marking his 27-day countdown of the crown.)

125
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,190
I, this day, inherit the Mandate of Heaven.

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
My heart is filled with reverence.

127
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,240
Yet the art of governance

128
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,150
is not something I can achieve alone.

129
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,860
It calls for the aid
of the virtuous and able.

130
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,200
I've prepared the list of names.

131
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,600
These officials stood by me
when I was not yet an Emperor.

132
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,540
They have talent and virtue.

133
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,600
Their deeds are distinguished.

134
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,730
And they bear a heart for the people.

135
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Thus,

136
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,270
I grant them high office.

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
Let it be proclaimed to all.

138
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,160
(On the New Emperor's first day,)

139
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,600
(he grants the Changle Guard command
to Anle, a former Changyi minister.)

140
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,780
(More than 200 close aides
were granted titles.)

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,380
(In the Weiyang Palace,)

142
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,380
(Huo Guang gazes
at the spirited young ruler.)

143
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,480
(His jade tablet trembles in hand.)

144
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,440
(This Great General
who served three reigns)

145
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,640
(now finds himself shut out of)

146
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,440
- (the new power map.)
- Your Majesty.

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
I, Huo Guang,

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,950
have a matter to present.

149
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,010
Proceed.

150
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,600
Your Majesty wishes to appoint new talents

151
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,040
for the Imperial Court.

152
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,620
Without constraint by convention,

153
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,120
this is indeed a virtuous act.

154
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
However,

155
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,190
it is vital to ensure
the veteran ministers

156
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,190
can contribute to their fullest.

157
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,680
Only with old and new working in harmony

158
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,240
can the realm be governed in peace.

159
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,750
This has been the practice of our dynasty.

160
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,750
Since the founding by Emperor Gaozu,

161
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,700
after more than a century of changes,

162
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,520
some policies may no longer
suit the times.

163
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,920
When change is needed, we must change,

164
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,600
and not cling to outdated ways.

165
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,580
Thus,

166
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,930
bringing in fresh talent

167
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,040
is truly a necessary course of action,

168
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,880
all in the hope of

169
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,900
securing the nation's lasting stability.

170
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,410
Your Majesty acts with firm resolve,

171
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
showing vision.

172
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
If so,

173
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,190
I may also step down

174
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,950
and take my rest.

175
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,190
Lord Huo, your service is meritorious.

176
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,340
It is indeed time you rested,

177
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,430
enjoying peace in your later years.

178
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,350
Your Majesty.

179
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,960
How is Heng?

180
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,630
Still not woken.

181
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,030
At times, he shakes his head and murmurs.

182
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
Did the physician say anything?

183
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,040
The same words as before.

184
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,320
No external injuries

185
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,270
nor internal ailments.

186
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,010
Though the wound has closed up,

187
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,300
it still seeps with blood.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,250
Did he say when he might wake?

189
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,410
Only Wang can wake on his own.

190
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,350
You've no idea
how flustered Huo Guang was

191
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
in court today,

192
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,790
I told him to retire.

193
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,790
And he actually agreed.

194
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,490
You should still be cautious.

195
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,850
It might just be a move to retreat

196
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,710
in order to advance.

197
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,960
Oh dear,

198
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,960
you and the Empress Dowager really get along.

199
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,440
Then shouldn't you call me Auntie?

200
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,960
You're taking advantage of me?

201
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,480
This is the greatest bargain under heaven.

202
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,360
I'm close to the Empress Dowager.

203
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,030
I've already sounded her out.

204
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,200
Huo Guang is her grandfather,

205
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,080
but the Shangguan Clan fell by his hand.

206
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,980
It is moving in our favor.

207
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,510
We only lack Heng now.

208
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't worry, he's blessed with fortune.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He will surely wake.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
Your Majesty,

211
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,030
Lord Wang has awakened.

212
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,270
Your words are truly prophetic.

213
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,340
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

214
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,240
Where did you get those wounds?

215
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll go cut him down for you.

216
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,910
I can't quite say for sure.

217
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,670
How long was I asleep?

218
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,270
Yesterday was Liu He's Enthronement Ceremony.

219
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,960
You've been unconscious since Bashang.

220
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
That long?

221
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
As expected.

222
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
I've been blacking out
for longer each time.

223
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,270
I need to step out.

224
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,840
Where are you going?

225
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Hold on.

226
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,560
I'll be right back.

227
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,860
(Huo Mansion)

228
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,960
Quick, go inform Lord Huo.

229
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,340
Tell him Wang Heng has come on business.

230
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,030
Are you Lord Wang from Changyi?

231
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,440
- Indeed.
- Lord Wang.

232
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,910
Lord Huo thought highly of you,

233
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,760
yet you miss every important occasion.

234
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,810
If you disregard his counsel like this,

235
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,930
how can he recommend you to his peers?

236
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,190
Now...

237
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,720
He has retired from the court.

238
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,440
Meeting you is less convenient.

239
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,170
Lord Wang, you'd best return.

240
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,110
This is bad.

241
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,710
Senior.

242
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,110
Where's Heng?

243
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,660
Running about right after waking up.

244
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,800
Let me ask you.

245
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,240
The matter on the cloth.

246
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,200
How much did you do?

247
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
You're truly extraordinary.

248
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,050
We've completed

249
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,440
all the events recorded on it.

250
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,840
Qingge and the Empress Dowager are friends.

251
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,190
She will surely lend us her support.

252
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,070
Mm.

253
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,870
Plus, with the gift from Qingge's father,

254
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,470
the records of official as our safeguard,

255
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,810
at the critical moment,

256
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,790
the court officials won't act recklessly.

257
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,120
I've persuaded Xu Guanghan.

258
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,670
The Wucheng Village is ready to move.

259
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,500
On this cloth,

260
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,250
only one matter remains unfinished.

261
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,470
Switch people out.

262
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,040
Right.

263
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,390
Couldn't get it done.

264
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,560
When I paid homage at the mausoleum,

265
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,880
he didn't meet with the generals

266
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,400
and instead came along with us.

267
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,780
I really couldn't find a chance.

268
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,120
Still, aside from matters on the cloth,

269
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,330
His Majesty granted
the Changle Guard command to Anle

270
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,800
and had Zhang Sheng in charge of the armory.

271
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,120
All of Changyi's brothers
have official posts.

272
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
I even talked Huo Guang into retiring.

273
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Now the court is full of our people.

274
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,060
Oh.

275
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
Don't worry.

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,910
You're an Imperial Censor now.

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,630
Imperial Censor?

278
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,750
What's wrong with it?

279
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,910
Won't risk offending others?

280
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,230
Coward.

281
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,750
Do you realize

282
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,170
everything you do aligns
with the Mandate of Heaven?

283
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,350
If this continues,

284
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,800
you'll be deposed.

285
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,440
What?

286
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,030
What is the Mandate of Heaven about?

287
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,360
Can you just tell me all of it?

288
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,080
The Mandate says,

289
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,240
Huo Guang will make you Emperor.

290
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,270
When you reach Dingtao,

291
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,200
you'll send over 50 men back.

292
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,750
The remaining

293
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,840
follow me

294
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,770
to Chang'an.

295
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,100
(Jiyang)
Once in Jiyang,

296
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,120
you'll seek a rooster
and buy a bamboo staff.

297
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,930
Or we defy fate and change destiny.

298
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,120
In Hongnong,

299
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,280
Chen Shan will be killed
for you seizing women.

300
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,150
Wasn't that you?

301
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,470
That's not the point.

302
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,440
Except for Shan not dying,

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,540
everything else came true.

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,840
And what will happen?

305
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,230
After that,

306
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,320
you commit 1127 absurd acts in Chang'an.

307
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,330
On the 27th day as the Emperor,

308
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,550
you take your men out to hunt.

309
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,320
Huo Guang deposes you

310
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
for corruption and imperiling the realm.

311
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,370
The ministers of Changyi are executed,

312
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
none spared.

313
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,230
Empress Dowager orders you
back to Changyi.

314
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Now,

315
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,320
you can't get out.

316
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,370
The warriors of Wucheng Village can't get in.

317
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,090
We're completely out of options.

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
Wait,

319
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,640
you just said,

320
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,460
on the day I was deposed,

321
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,880
I'm taking my men out for a hunt.

322
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,510
Isn't that perfect?

323
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,360
We could bring in the villagers by then.

324
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,180
That would see our plan through.

325
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,040
No, we can't.

326
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,960
Why not?

327
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,670
It's far too risky.

328
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,010
If we slip up at any step,

329
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,200
you'll be utterly ruined.

330
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,750
There will be no turning back then.

331
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,800
Heng,

332
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,350
don't forget,

333
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,030
you are the one my fate hinges upon.

334
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,080
We once defied the odds and prevailed.

335
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,910
Why can't we change fate again?

336
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,480
The Qilin is still in the house of Huo.

337
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,910
Yet you hesitate,
swallowing your feelings.

338
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,480
Victory hangs in this moment.

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,120
If you shrink back now,

340
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,510
how will you face the consequences?

341
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,150
Better to know nothing and take the leap.

342
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,990
No way.

343
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,590
This matter

344
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,390
