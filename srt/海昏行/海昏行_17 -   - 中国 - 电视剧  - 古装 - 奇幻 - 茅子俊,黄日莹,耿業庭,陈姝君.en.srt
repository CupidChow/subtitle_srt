They'll come pick us up early tomorrow.

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,430
So everyone, rest early tonight.

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,790
Do you have unique local food here?

35
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,460
Rest assured, milord.

36
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,590
I'll keep my eyes on him.

37
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,190
Go to Chang'an on your own.

38
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,330
Don't be mad at Yan Yannian.

39
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,200
Who's Yan Yannian?

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,240
Xu Qingge's father.

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,330
No matter what happens,

42
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,280
stay at your mansion.

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,920
- I'll come for you, remember?
- Mm.

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,310
You two help him go over it.

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,230
I'll head off first.

46
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,070
Oh.

47
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,940
I'm Wang Heng. I've been expecting you.

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,120
Lord Wang, Lord Huo is looking for you.

49
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,380
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

50
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,190

You must be Li Guang.

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,150
I am indeed.

53
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,110
I wish to discuss Lord Huo with you.

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
Lord Wang, please come inside.

55
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,990
After you.

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120

- Lord Wang.

57
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,010
This drink will help you on your way.

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,240
Take your misdeeds

59
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,870

Help! Someone, please!

After him, now!

63
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,990
- Lord Wang.
- Traitor Wang Heng.

64
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,140
Finish compiling that blacklist. Now!

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,350
What blacklist?

66
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,540
You challenge Great General Huo?

67
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,570
Wang Heng, you plotted treason.

68
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
It is beyond pardon.

69
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,310
Do as you please

70
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,630
if you want to kill me.

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,470
For your service to Duke of Changyi,

72
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,600
Lord Huo shows magnanimity

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
and spares your life.

74
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,530
Guards, carry out castration.

75
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
No! End my life instead!

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
My apologies.

78
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,750
Sorry for falling asleep.

79
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,910
Ah, the youth.

80
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,750
Good sleep quality.

81
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,970
Lord Xiahou, I will speak

82
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,370
plainly.

83
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:06,860
Let's unseat

84
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,310
Huo Guang.

85
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,080
That's nonsense.

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,590
Forget it.

87
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,230
Lord Wang.

88
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,440
Let's find a quiet place.

89

Greetings, milord.

90
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,030
And you are?

91
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,710
I am Xu Guanghan,

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,660
used to work in Changyi.

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
Show him out.

94
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,090
Huo Guang is a sly

95
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,280
holdover from two reigns.

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,840
Will you join me in bringing him down?

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,010
What?

98
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,870
Who is that?

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
Father, this man is plotting treason.

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Huh?

101
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,720
Haha.

102
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,760
Do you have unique local...

103
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,120
Hey!

104
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,210
Stop talking, just get in.

105
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,360
Fan Mingyou, Han Zeng, cross.

106
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,530
Zhao Chongguo, cross. Zhang Anshi, cross.

Hyah!

109
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
Hyah!

110
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,470
Whoa!

111
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,270
Everyone, keep this in mind.

112
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,000
You must follow the rules of the court.

113
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,240
Once you enter the Palace,

114
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,940
you may not come and go freely.

115
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,100
Not allowed...

116
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,030
Eh? Lord Wang.

117
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,310
What is this about?

118
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,840
You must eat well.

119
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,100
Who can protect you when I'm not around?

120
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Heng.

121
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,160
What's the matter?

122
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,670
Heng.

123
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,340

How did you know I drafted this list?

129

Heng.

130
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,640
Heng.

131
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,040
Heng.

132
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,150
Heng.

133
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,780
Heng!

134
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,390
This doesn't seem like a mere chill.

135
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,640
Lord Wang hasn't eaten or drunk for days.

136
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,470
Can his body endure that?

137
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,520
Heng.

138
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,090
Is there anything you feel like eating?

139
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,950
Tell me if you want something.

140
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,950
Duke, he...

141
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,110
To...

142
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,890
Tomato...

143
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Eg...

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,200
Egg.

145
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,780
What is this thing?

146
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,440
To...
[*To: West]

147
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,330
Tomato...
[*Tomato: red persimmon]

148
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,360
Egg.

149
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,120
Wha... what is this thing?

150
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,510
I know egg

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,350
and persimmon.

152
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,710
Lord Gong.

153
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,860
You are truly learned.

154
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,800
So, what exactly is a tomato?

155
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,120
Tomato...

156
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,650
Duke.

157
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,030
A red persimmon from the Western Market.

158
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,210
Lord Gong, you really know these things.

159
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,050
Such trouble.

160
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,160
It must be from the Western Market.

161
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,830
Fresh steamed bun for sale.

162
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,990
Come take a look.

163
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,330
Fresh steamed bun.

164
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,440
No fresh persimmons today?

165
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,740
We only have dried ones this season.

166
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,130
Buy it or move along.

167
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,060
Don't touch everything.

168
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,920
You really are...

169
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,780
Qi.

170
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,230
Xu Qingge.

171
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,720
Xu Qingge.

172
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,760
How are you?

173
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,970
I'll now issue my first imperial decree:

174
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,770
Never do such foolish things again.

175
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,170
You're not enthroned
and already so haughty.

176
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,360
What will you be like by then?

177
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,100
This little cat is adorable.

178
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,320
What's its name?

179
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,830
Her name is Xiao'an.

180
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,580
I picked her for your Empress Mother.

181
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,320
She loves kittens.

182
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,600
Ow.

183
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,060
It's only been a few days apart,

184
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,120
yet you're as close as sisters.

185
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,800
That's right.

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,870
And you're my nephew.

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,890
You're taking advantage of me.

188
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,720
Good nephew, let me have one of those.

189
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,910
No way.

190
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,770
These are ingredients
I'm going to cook with.

191
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,050
Then I will taste your cooking, nephew.

192
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,590
Your father was worried
when you went missing.

193
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,510
Maybe send him a word?

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,750
He never cared for me

195
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,750
when I was in Changyi.

196
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,590
It's too late for him to care now.

197
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,630
Did you make this dish yourself?

198
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,680
Mm.

199
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,830
What's this dish called?

200
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,390
Tomato...

201
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,630
Egg...

202
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,000
Tomato Egg.

203
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,330
So that's how you see it?

204
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,960
I sought Lord Gong's advice for this.

205
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,430
The ripest persimmons
in the Western Market.

206
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,200
Fresh eggs laid this morning.

207
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,830
Wang is awake.

208
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,200
What day is it?

209
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,960
How long was I asleep?

210
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,490
For two full days.

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,510
I was afraid you might never wake.

212
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,800
Heng.

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,960
Heng.

214
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,820
Tomato Egg.

215
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,440
I made it myself.

216
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,630
Is this even edible?

217
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,140
(Wucheng Village)

218
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,390
How's this blade?

219
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,090
Perfect. They're twin blades after all.

220
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,320
It's the Moonfall Blades.

221
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,120
Every edge carries the power of the skies.

222
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,200
Your grandmaster sought out

223
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,790
the finest craftsmen

224
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,180
and forged it
from the rarest meteoric iron.

225
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,370
Years ago, your master and I each held one

226
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,670
and sought our fortune

227
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,510
in the martial world.

228
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,710
And now,

229
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,120
I will give you mine as well.

230
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,720
When the twin blades unite,

231
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,580
they serve to protect

232
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,570
and uphold the justice.

233
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,270
I entrust you with the future

234
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,550
of the whole village.

235
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,120
Such a deep connection.

236
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,080
I won't fail your trust.

237
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,080
Go now.

238
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,710
On this journey, be sure to tell Liu He,

239
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,690
if he agrees to what we request,

240
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,550
all of us will leave this place

241
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,960
to serve with all our strength.

242
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,320
Hyah!

243
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
Wang.

244
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,360
You really uncovered their identities.

245
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,870
Thanks to the Duke's careful work.

246
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,790
Without Qingge,

247
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,640
I wouldn't have compiled this list.

248
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,230
Heng.

249
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,320
Mm.

250
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,760
If we really go by your mark,

251
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,390
no general in Chang'an
is willing to help us.

252
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,120
I only use this list

253
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,680
to bluff the court officials.

254
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,030
As for those military ones,

255
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,910
they collude up and down the ranks.

256
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,280
Their ties are deep,

257
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
each acting without fear.

258
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,490
What?

259
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640
I'm the Emperor, and I can't even

260
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,920
command the troops?

261
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,920
In name, you are the Emperor.

262
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,240
But in truth,

263
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,140
every single soldier of the court

264
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,390
answers only to Huo Guang.

265
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,670
That is what currently

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,680
troubles us the most.

267
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,070
Alas.

268
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,850
Senior.

269
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,630
You're back.

270
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,390
My martial uncle and his men
are skilled fighters,

271
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,550
supporting the Crown Prince.

272
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,320
Due to their ties with witchcraft,

273
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,640
they had to flee from the court's forces,

274
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,430
living in constant fear,

275
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
always on the move.

276
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,950
They had to live incognito
in Wucheng Village.

277
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,630
Village Chief Ren Xuan is your martial uncle.

278
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,240
Duke, once you ascend the throne,

279
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,750
could you grant them proper titles,

280
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,750
so they may live in peace?

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,450
If they're willing to help,

282
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,000
then it's naturally no trouble.

283
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,510
There's one more matter.

284
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,870
Go on.

285
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,720
My martial uncle has risked his life

286
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,610
all for the Crown Prince.

287
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,210
Duke, could you grant him...

288
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,470
Of course.

289
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,250
After all, he's of the Liu Clan.

290
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,340
It's right to grant him a title and land.

291
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,640
To bring down Huo Guang,

292
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,540
Uncle and his men
should be inside the Palace.

293
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
But for now, they're just martial artists.

294
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,950
They lack a reason.

295
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,280
Then we'll replace the pillars.

296
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,860
We'll have

297
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,800
our people from Changyi

298
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,790
swap with the warriors

299
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,240
of Wucheng Village.

300
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,920
The court approves the entry of my men

301
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,460
for teaching proper conduct.

302
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,630
But in truth,

303
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,070
it's just a way to confine them.

304
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,390
So what's the point

305
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,240
of this replacement?

306
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,750
I was furious at first.

307
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,840
But right now,

308
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,590
I have my men inside the Palace.

309
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,490
That replacement

310
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,050
has a chance naturally.

311
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,460
If we want to make it,

312
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,200
we need the Empress Dowager.

313
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,000
To gain Her Majesty's help,

314
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,270
we must count on...

315
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,800
you.

316
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,110
Your Majesty.

317
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,920
You're as close as sisters.

318
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,630
She is surrounded by many attendants.

319
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,880
Why not ask for her help?

320
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,870
Your Majesty.

321
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,540
I just miss my father

322
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,330
and my grandfather.

323
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Then perhaps…

324
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,600
Take a stroll outside?

325
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,360
She entered the Palace long ago.

326
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,200
Later, her clan was implicated
in Liu Dan's rebellion.

327
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,590
And Huo Guang had them executed.

328
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,390
Huo Guang was her maternal grandfather,

329
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,120
but in her heart,

330
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,670
there must be resentment.

331
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,280
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager.

332
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,720
We've reported all pressing matters of late.

333
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,840
We await your judgment.

334
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,180
You've worked hard. The matters you reported,

335
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,080
I'm already aware of.

336
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,210
The affairs of the state

337
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,200
require all of you to work together

338
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
to find the best course.

339
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,770
We will obey...

340
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,630
Grandfather.

341
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,080
I humbly ask for a favor.

342
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,980
What do you command, Your Majesty?

343
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,300
We are all ears and await your word.

344
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,900
The Late Emperor's funeral is coming.

345
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,040
Every time I think of it,

346
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,080
my heart feels bound and heavy.

347
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,150
Though the Palace is of splendor,

348
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,730
it cannot veil the loneliness.

349
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,940
I wish...

350
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,590
I wish to leave here for a bit

351
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,560
to clear my mind.

352
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,300
It may ease my sorrow a little.

353
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,840
Your Majesty,

354
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,550
during the mourning period,

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
leaving the Palace

356
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,660
is no small matter.

357
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,750
I fear the unrest beyond the gates

358
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,370
and cannot fully ensure your safety.

359
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,620
Moreover, your safety is most precious

360
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,650
and should not be put at risk lightly.

361
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,790
I'll bring more guards with me.

362
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,360
Every corner here holds
remnants of the past.

363
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,300
The Late Emperor is gone.

364
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,650
And I'm left all alone.

365
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,480
All the memories of the past

366
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,950
come at me day after day.

367
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,390
I truly…

368
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
truly…

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,150
Milords.

370
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,910
You've worked hard today.

371
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,600
Please go and rest now.

372
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,470
Yes.

373
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,360
From now on,

374
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,120
in front of the officials,

375
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,240
you only address me as Great General.

376
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,750
I admit my mistake.

377
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,670
Hurry and clean up.

378
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,850
