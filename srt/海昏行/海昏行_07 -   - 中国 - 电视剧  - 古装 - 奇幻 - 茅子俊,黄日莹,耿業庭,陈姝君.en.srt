With wine in hand,

31
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,070
I'm free,

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,480
unbound, and at ease.

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,310
What are you doing?

34
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,600
Making your wish come true.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,550
Quick, recite the spell.

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
Go on, say it.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,000
You cast the spell.

38
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,640
Why should I recite it?

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,920
Don't tell me you…

40
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,560
forgot the incantation already.

41
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,480
You make the wish.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,150
Of course you recite the spell.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,760
Hurry up.

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Alright.

45
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,710
Unlock the mystical.

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Unlock the mystical.

47
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,740
Bridge the ancient and the present.

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,280
Bridge the Ancient and the Present.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,870
I want it and I get it.

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,200
I want it and I get it?

51
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,530
Worry about nothing.

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,590
Unlock the mystical.

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,120
Bridge the ancient and the present.

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,890
I want it and I get it.

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,640
Worry about nothing.

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Set.

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,960
This is...

58
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,870
The wish worked.

59
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,470
You're not just being my friend

60
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,120
because I'm Liu He, are you?

61
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,150
Between buddies,

62
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,170
we don't fuss over nonsense.

63
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,160
Buddies?

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,470
What does that mean?

65
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,990
It means

66
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
true friend.

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Alright.

68
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,030
Then I, Liu He,

69
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,590
will call you my buddy.

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,900
Honestly, I'd rather

71
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,150
you were Qi Chang.

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
Both are me.

73
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,960
Wang Heng.

74
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,840
Oh dear.

75
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,730
My apologies.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
I drank too much alone last night

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,600
and lost track of time.

78
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,730
That Blank Seal I gave you...

79
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,000
Did you bring it along?

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,870
How could I leave behind the finest jade?

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Listen,

82
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,330
you only need to think of one thing.

83
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,190
What is it?

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,910
Just think about

85
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,030
what official title
to be carved on that seal.

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,560
We're heading to Chang'an
to make our mark.

87
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,030
I'm grateful to you.

88
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,870
Come on.

89
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,280
Get ready to depart.

90
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,400
- Alright.
- Okay.

91
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,320
Let's move out.

92
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:11,340
(Changyi)

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Hyah! Hyah!

94
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,750
Whoa! Make way!

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,040
Watch out, don't get run over!

96
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,560
Duke, please slow down.

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,160
Duke, wait for us.

98
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,220
- Duke!
- Keep up back there!

99
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,030
Hyah!

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Hyah!

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Hyah!

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
Hyah!

103
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Duke.

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,280
The journey to Chang'an is long

105
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,830
and the matter is of great importance.

106
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,510
We must not rush or lose proper decorum.

107
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,050
And we mustn't act recklessly.

108
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,920
Lord Gong, I haven't traveled this far.

109
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,260
Please understand me.

110
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,790
Hyah!

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
Well well.

112
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,480
Lord Wang, what worries you

113
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,850
is what troubles me as well.

114
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,710
Uh?

115
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,780
The trip to Chang'an will be full of danger.

117
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,460
I must trouble you to stay vigilant.

118
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,630
I must trouble you instead.

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
I'm already an old man.

120
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,200
The Duke refuses to heed my advice.

121
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,880
We may not have reached Chang'an yet,

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,450
but the trial has already begun.

123
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,430
Yes, yes.

124
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,470
Every word and action of the Duke

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,390
is under the watchful eyes of others.

126
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,280
Right, right.

127
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,430
A single careless move

128
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,830
and tongues will wag.

129
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,710
The Duke's path
to the throne will be hard.

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,040
You are not only his subject,

131
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,430
but also his friend.

132
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,360
Yes, yes.

133
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,640
Heng,

134
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,520
come feel the breeze.

135
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,350
Giddy-up.

136
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,750
Giddy-up.

137
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,460
(Changyi)

138
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,980
(Dingtao, Longshan Inn)

139
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:26,780
(Longshan Inn)

140
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,820
Please, come inside.

141
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,990
Will you be staying or eating?

142
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,030
Bring some tea.

143
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,160
Have a seat, please.

144
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,480
The wind howls. The moon hides.

145
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,120
A lone crane flies south.

146
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
(Li Wei, Yannian's guard)

147
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,800
Are the Jinlin Guards here?

148
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,120
A night prowler entering my home

149
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
never comes without reason.

150
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,270
I am Li Wei of the Jinlin Guards.

151
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,120
I've come to claim the Qilin Token.

152
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,580
(Swift Blade, Yun Qing)

153
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,630
Lord Li, have you brought gold?

154
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,620
Payment upon delivery.

155
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,600
No questions asked.

156
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,960
It's the code of the martial world.

157
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,340
Surely the Court won't break its word?

158
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,600
You misunderstand.

159
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,130
This is no ordinary item.

160
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
We need to verify everything first.

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,640
Once confirmed, we'll present the gold.

162
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,000
Since the Court fails to honor the rules,

163
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,610
we'll deal with this Qilin in our way.

164
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,540
De Jiu,

165
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,120
let's go.

166
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
As for rules,

167
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,360
I doubt they're yours to decide.

168
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,550
Open the door! Open up!

169
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,050
Is anyone there?

170
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Hurry, open the door.

171
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,630
Come on, faster.

172
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
I hear people inside.

173
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,390
Open up.

174
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,580
Hold on, Duke.

175
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,870
This run-down inn in the countryside...

176
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,120
I reckon it's been deserted.

177
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,810
The county town is not far ahead.

178
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,500
- There will be better lodging.
- Yes.

179
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,600
Besides, this place doesn't look safe.

180
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,440
- Indeed.
- Mm.

181
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,480
Mm.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,910
None of you...

183
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,870
want me to stay here, right?

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,330
Mm.

185
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,310
I insist on staying.

186
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,280
Hey.

187
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,860
Here we go again.

188
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,870
Ay, Duke…

189
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,630
Your status is one of honor.

190
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,840
Lodging and meals follow court protocol.

191
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,980
So what if my status is high?

192
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,920
I don't need to sit above everyone.

193
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,220
I can share the hardships of the people.

194
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,500
I find this little inn quite fine.

195
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,900
Unlike my mansion,

196
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,180
it's nothing but a grand facade.

197
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,140
Inside, it's just

198
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,480
filled with your tiresome company.

199
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,090
Ay… sir.

200
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,390
My apologies.

201
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,830
Our humble shop is closed.

202
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,850
Oh.

203
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,760
There's a great inn not far from here.

204
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,710
It's quite comfortable to stay there.

205
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,360
May I trouble you to walk a bit further?

206
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,710
Mm.

207
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,760
That works well.

208
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,840
Yes.

209
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,800
Then…

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
You all can stay there.

211
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,280
I'll stay here instead.

212
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,480
Ah, that won't do, Duke.

213
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,670
Duke, this isn't right.

214
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,720
There's no way to stop me.

215
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,960
I'll stay here too.

216
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
Alas.

217
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
It's inconvenient for you to stay here.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,550
So you do know it's inconvenient.

219
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,270
Yet you show no care
for a lady's comfort.

220
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,320
Or is it that

221
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,030
you're trying to hide something

222
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,540
from us.

223
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,320
Out here in the middle of nowhere,

224
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,240
what could I do?

225
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
At most,

226
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,980
enjoy the fun of hunting.

227
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,980
- Sir, sir.
- Can't stop him.

228
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,900
Duke.

229
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,120
I'll stay here with the Duke.

230
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,900
You arrange for more guards.

231
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,360
Do the job. You'll be paid.

232
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,570
Ah, understood.

233
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,550
This place does feel a bit odd.

234
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,770
- Then go another comfortable inn.
- Clean.

235
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,630
- Alright.
- Quiet.

236
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,490
I won't.

237
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,420
Get it tidied up.

238
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,530
We were chasing a wild boar just now.

239
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,240
But the beast's strength is astonishing.

240
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,290
It made such a mess.

241
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,180
I ask for your lordships' understanding.

242
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,090
- Wild boar?
- Mm.

243
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,160
You're already closed.

244
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,380
Why still go after wild boar?

245
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,710
Haha.

246
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,000
To be honest,

247
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm actually a hunter by trade.

248
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,630
This inn here

249
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,840
is merely my side business.

250
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,750
See?

251
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,090
Oh.

252
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
It's alright.

253
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,910
Just be careful.

254
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,960
Then tonight, let's try something new.

255
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,770
How about roast wild boar?

256
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,120
Good.

257
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,440
I'll see to it at once.

258
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,210
Seems like those folks

259
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,970
must be people of wealth or high rank.

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,570
You'd better be smart about this.

261
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,620
That's Liu He, Duke of Changyi.

262
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,800
The Qilin came from him.

263
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,000
They have the advantage in numbers.

264
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,480
We can't confront them head-on.

265
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,150
Or we might alert them too soon.

266
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,470
Stay calm.

267
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,030
The Qilin matter is top secret.

268
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,630
It involves the Duke and us both.

269
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,350
Right now,

270
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,000
we have to work together.

271
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,630
First, let's get them to leave.

272
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,990
Master.

273
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,630
This man can't be trusted.

274
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,750
Don't worry.

275
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,910
The Qilin is still in your hands.

276
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,800
As for the gold,

277
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,910
I'll settle that with you as well.

278
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,820
What kind of cooperation do you want?

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,990
Know how to roast meat?

280
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,630
What's that smell?

281
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,150
Smells amazing.

282
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,010
Hey, hey, hey.

283
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,870
Sir.

284
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,720
Take a look.

285
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,000
This is our special roast wild boar.

286
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,550
I was about to let you have a taste.

287
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,960
Have a seat inside.

288
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,240
Better not stain your robes.

289
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,580
Wait over there.

290
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,720
- Hurry up, I'm starving.
- Alright.

291
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,650
Alright, alright.

292
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,820
Just a moment.

293
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,900
Sir, the finest roast meat.

294
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,000
Here you go, enjoy.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,840
Smells wonderful.

296
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,920
I knew it.

297
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,750
For true flavor, this is the place.

298
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
Have a whiff.

299
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,440
Go on, smell it.

300
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,390
So fragrant.

301
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,630
Isn't this just roasted meat?

302
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,840
What's so special about it?

303
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,910
This is wild boar meat.

304
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Freshly hunted.

305
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,480
What's worth eating in it?

306
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,630
Ah, you don't get it.

307
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,190
It's just been hunted.

308
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,720
It carries the unique aroma
of this land.

309
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,700
That is the way of rustic delicacies.

310
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
Innkeep.

311
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,960
Hey.

312
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,870
This meat is far too greasy.

313
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,360
Do you have something lighter?

314
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,320
We don't have those.

315
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,580
Come on,

316
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,840
it's rare for us to come out.

317
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,150
Why settle for simple fare?

318
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,080
The journey's been exhausting.

319
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
I really can't eat much.

320
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,720
I'll head back to rest.

321
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,280
Wang, I'll take my leave.

322
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,710
Innkeep.

323
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,030
Yes, sir.

324
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,550
Do you have any millet or beans here?

325
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,980
Sorry, sir, we don't have that.

326
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,880
Come on.

327
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,360
Don't eat that.

328
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,840
Fine, I will anyway.

329
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,440
What are you doing?

330
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,320
Why are you here?

331
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,550
Look over this way.

332
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,870
The Duke of Changyi is heavily guarded.

333
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,360
You mean to kill him here?

334
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,360
Do you think the Court will let you go?

335
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,840
Once the Duke of Changyi is taken down,

336
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,790
those cowardly rats outside

337
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,600
wouldn't dare to serve.

338
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,150
All I know is,

339
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,850
we are now on the same boat.

340
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,270
If you want to get out,
don't act rashly.

341
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,220
You've been watching us?

342
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,110
And you stopped us from killing the Duke.

343
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,960
Who exactly are you?

344
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,440
Why didn't you

345
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,480
say so earlier?

346
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,790
You didn't listen.

347
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,910
Who could've stopped you?

348
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,210
Glad Qingge didn't eat it.

349
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,750
I saw several blade marks in the lobby.

350
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,960
That must have been

351
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,750
left from slaughtering a boar.

352
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,380
But the mark on the cabinet is deep and long.

353
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,270
It stretched all the way
to the signboard.

354
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,330
What kind of wild boar
could leap that high?

355
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,960
I also noticed several spots of blood

356
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,150
had been covered up.

357
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,080
The bleeding wasn't much,

358
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,030
more like traces from a fight.

359
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,810
If it were just butchering a boar,

360
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,970
there should be more blood left.

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,580
Even if the wild boar struggled,

362
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,060
it couldn't have splattered everywhere.

363
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,070
This is a proper inn,

364
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,350
yet there's not a grain or vegetable.

365
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,140
Why go out of the way
to kill a wild boar?

366
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,710
Couldn't jumping high

367
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,160
just be what that wild boar does?

368
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,910
Couldn't hunting

369
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,350
just be the innkeeper's pastime?

370
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,640
What do you think?

371
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,110
Me?

372
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,030
Come on, let's go take a look.

373
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
Go, go, go.

374
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,440
Still not giving up?

375
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,150
See?

376
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,550
Told you it was wild boar meat.

377
