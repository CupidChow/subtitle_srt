=Episode 3=

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Soon, the Duke will be able to go

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,840
to Chang'an with full honor.

32
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,720
Why is that?

33
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,370
(Because I know the history, you fool.)

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,830
This is the Mandate of Heaven.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,520
I can only tell the Duke.

36
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,090
Just handle the equine administration

37
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,820
and lift the Duke's confinement.

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,090
What else is there to fear?

39
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,990
But

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,790
if you fail to do so,

41
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,650
we'll all lose our heads.

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,500
(Trying to scare me?)

43
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,490
(Huh.)

44
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
Alright.

45
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,070
I have one condition.

46
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,910
Speak.

47
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,120
Once it is settled,

48
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,500
I must see the Duke immediately.

49
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,150
Deal.

50
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,430
(So gullible.)

51
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,600
After you.

52
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
(Unfamiliar face.)

53
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,680
(Easily swayed.)

54
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,640
(Not bad at all.)

55
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,790
(A fine stand-in.)

56
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,920
(I'll leave the city)

57
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,150
(very soon.)

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,120
That's it?

59
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,300
Ow! Be gentle.

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,630
Does that hurt?

61
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,590
Ouch.

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,190
Hey, go easy.

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,430
That hurts, too?

64
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,740
Physician Li is great.

65
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,020
He's also Li Qi's father.

66
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,200
You should trust him.

67
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,150
Thanks.

68
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,400
Is Wang Heng badly hurt?

69
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,620
(Li Zhong)
He landed hard on his rear

70
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,440
and bumped his eye.

71
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,410
No injury to the bones.

72
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,920
Nothing serious.

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,500
Then I'll leave him in your hands.

74
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,060
Alright, I'll take my leave.

75
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,990
(I must have the Immortal)

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
(learn to ride,)

77
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,980
(or my whole plan falls apart.)

78
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,470
Let me be straight with you.

79
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,280
Once the horse affairs are settled,

80
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,200
Lord Gong will have the Duke
race with the people.

81
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,780
As the event host, I'll arrange
for you to join the match.

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
Then you'll get to compete with him.

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
Really?

84
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,460
Of course, I'll take care of it.

85
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,470
But you must also give it your all.

86
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,150
At least, you need to know
how to ride a horse.

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
(To meet Liu He,)

88
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,310
(just tolerate this fool for now.)

89
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,430
Step aside.

90
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
I'll practice.

91
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,990
(Done.)

92
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,280
(Next, I must persuade Lord Gong)

93
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,280
(to agree to the horse race
outside the city.)

94
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,380
(Let me try the method
the Immortal taught me.)

95
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,520
(Watch me.)

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,800
Lord Gong, Chancellor.

97
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,070
Duke.

98
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,030
Duke.

99
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,580
I've invited both the Chancellor
and the Governor here.

100
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,030
Do we need manpower or money?

101
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,850
Let's hear it.

102
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,870
(Chancellor of Changyi, An Le)
What's your plan?

103
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,050
A horse race outside the city.

104
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,400
Horse racing.

105
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,670
To seek amusement?

106
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,770
That is not so.

107
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,760
If I delight in music here,

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,680
the people will hear my bells and drums

109
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,140
and the sound of flutes and pipes.

110
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,840
They'll beam with joy
and tell each other

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,640
that I must be free from illness;

112
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,160
otherwise, I couldn't have made music.

113
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,340
When I go on a hunt,
the people will hear my chariots

114
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,240
and see my banners.

115
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,930
They'll beam with joy
and tell each other

116
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,390
that I must be free from illness.

117
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,510
The reason is simple.

118
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,120
It's to share my joy with the people.

119
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,480
If I rejoice with the people,

120
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,660
that is what makes me a true duke.

121
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
I believe

122
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,270
the equine administration

123
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,120
should be more than just raising
and trading horses.

124
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,520
The equine administration

125
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,200
should also win the hearts
of the people.

126
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,240
Rejoice with the people.

127
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,040
It's to make them feel happy

128
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,240
and passionate about the administration.

129
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,750
Wouldn't that be a fine thing?

130
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,120
Once people have passion,

131
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,670
the equine administration
will surely work.

132
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,050
For this horse racing event,

133
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,320
we must rally all of Changyi

134
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
from the officials to the people

135
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,080
and also

136
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,710
count on the Chancellor's support.

137
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,590
Very well.

138
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,050
If the equine administration prospers,

139
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,760
it'll surely be a grand event
for Changyi.

140
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,310
I've brought the official seal.

141
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,160
If you want to issue a decree,

142
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,480
just go ahead and do it.

143
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,610
What do you think, Lord Gong?

144
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,270
I have one condition.

145
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,890
You must set the equine administration
in order within the city.

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
As for the horse racing outside,

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,190
I will make sure everything is arranged.

148
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,810
- (Half done.)
- Good plan.

149
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,590
(Regardless
of the equine administration,)

150
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,950
(this stand-in)

151
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,700
(must first learn how to ride a horse.)

152
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,650
Left.

153
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
Right.

154
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,940
You should've pulled.

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,040
Put some feelings into it.

156
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Yes, feelings.

157
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,820
Good.

158
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
Be good.

159
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,970
Mm, good.

160
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,870
That's right.

161
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,400
See? There are feelings.

162
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,720
Get up.

163
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,600
If you can't overcome
even this small hurdle,

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
how will you face the Duke?

165
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,890
Another ten laps.

166
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,700
(Qingge Tavern)
I've pondered.

167
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,800
To make it work,

168
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,340
we have to earn through horse breeding.

169
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,340
But these days,
few in Changyi keep horses.

170
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,750
How can we revive
the horse-rearing custom?

171
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,560
Our land just isn't fit for it.

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,760
Exactly.

173
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,760
Don't any of you have a good idea?

174
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,340
I do.

175
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,200
Say it.

176
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,100
Since ancient times,

177
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,950
it's always been breeding many
from a few.

178
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,270
Yes, that makes sense.

179
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,560
Why not borrow all the city's horses
from the people?

180
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,680
We can gather them together
in one place,

181
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,270
keep the stallions and mares together,

182
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,740
and let them breed foals.

183
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
When the foals grow up,

184
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,270
they'll be worth a fortune.

185
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,040
Naturally, people will want
to raise them.

186
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
That's a fine plan.

187
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,190
I have another idea.

188
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,390
Go on.

189
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,080
We could open a few horse meat diners.

190
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,330
With so many coming to eat,

191
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,950
people would surely raise more horses.

192
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,880
Mm.

193
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,870
Where would the horses

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,100
for the diner come from?

195
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,210
Naturally,

196
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,780
from Bushi's horse ranch.

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
Everything

198
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,720
links together.

199
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,310
A truly brilliant plan.

200
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,560
Well, I have one, too.

201
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,400
Shut up.

202
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,950
Ha ha ha.

203
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,030
Well, in just a short while,

204
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,310
you've come up with so many good ideas.

205
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,600
Here in Changyi,

206
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,870
we truly have no shortage of talent.

207
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,800
Our equine future

208
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,830
is right within reach.

209
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,160
It's all thanks to your fine teaching.

210
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,880
Hold on.

211
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,840
It seems you've long been ready
for horse affairs.

212
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,310
But I only know

213
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,230
how to toil in the horse ranch.

214
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
So, gentlemen,

215
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,170
would you answer a few questions?

216
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,580
Heng, ask away.

217
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,560
- Bushi.
- Mm.

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,760
How long does it take
for a foal to grow up?

219
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,560
One year of feeding.

220
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,640
- One year to mature.
- Two years.

221
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,480
Can the Duke wait?

222
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,500
What if the foal dies?

223
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,920
All these horses are borrowed
from the people.

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
If the people have no horses

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,830
to use,

226
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,970
what are they supposed to do?

227
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,150
Zhang Sheng.

228
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,760
His horses can't be relied upon.

229
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,600
What will happen to your diner?

230
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,600
You can't do this.

231
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,910
Then...

232
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,750
What about buying from another county?

233
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,510
Horses are so costly.

234
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,000
- Who'll cover
- Quiet.

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,530
the cost every year, you or the people?

236
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,990
You didn't consider the cost,

237
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,070
the time needed,

238
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,160
or the risks.

239
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,170
You're quite something.

240
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,320
Alas.

241
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
Lady Qingge.

242
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,360
You said in your land,

243
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,190
everyone knows how to ride?

244
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,190
Yes, in our land,

245
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,680
riding is a skill everyone must have.

246
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,470
(Got it.)

247
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,810
Heng, do you have a clever plan?

248
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,360
It's time

249
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,090
to show you, people of the Han,

250
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,000
a taste of true economics.

251
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,620
(Changyi)

252
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,150
Come and see!

253
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,000
Changyi Riders Racing with the Wind.

254
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,960
Make way, make way!

255
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,720
The Grand Horse Race

256
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,790
is coming!

257
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,720
The Grand Horse Race

258
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
is coming!

259
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,240
Do we need such a grand scene?

260
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,030
Of course.

261
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,160
The aim of the administration
is to make a profit.

262
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,130
It doesn't necessarily mean
raising horses.

263
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,460
It could be an event instead.

264
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,270
For any event, early publicity is vital.

265
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,540
Publicity brings topics.

266
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,520
Topics spark conversation.

267
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,970
(Grand Horse Race)
Conversation

268
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,210
leads to trending searches.

269
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,950
Trending searches?

270
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,720
(Changyi Li)
It means money on the way.

271
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,510
Right now,

272
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,690
the win or loss in racing speed
doesn't matter.

273
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,260
People serve the horses.

274
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,040
The rider is what truly matters.

275
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,900
Voting decides
whether a rider can compete.

276
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,750
(No.1 Horse, Odds)

277
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,540
A competitor's fate lies

278
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,060
(No.1 Horse, Odds)
in patrons' hands.

279
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,640
(Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding)
Fate is precious.

280
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,710
Come on.

281
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,390
Get ready for tonight's carnival.

282
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,510
Dear villagers,

283
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,630
gather around!

284
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
I have an announcement to make.

285
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,630
The Changyi Equestrian Festival

286
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,200
will officially

287
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,670
open its grand curtain

288
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,000
at sunset

289
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,020
on Water Street of the Western Market.

290
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,750
Great.

291
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,020
Good.

292
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,510
I understand now.

293
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,440
Fate

294
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,670
is money.

295
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,600
No.

296
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,840
Fate

297
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
is a sense

298
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
of control.

299
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,030
Do you really think

300
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,840
this will work?

301
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,910
You'll know

302
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,080
the answer tonight.

303
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,030
Was that performance exciting?

304
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,890
Yeah.

305
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,870
Good, good.

306
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,830
Let's welcome our next group.

307
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,670
Alright.

308
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,670
Alright, first,

309
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,080
please introduce yourselves.

310
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,030
A warm welcome!

311
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,270
Alright.

312
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,930
I am Xu Pingjun, the Geng contestant.

313
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,240
(Chou, Geng)
I'm from Changyi.

314
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,120
Alright.

315
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,910
I am Du Ruofeng, the Chou contestant.

316
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,270
I come from Huling.

317
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,510
Great.

318
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,080
Now, please present

319
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,480
your talent performance for us.

320
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
Great.

321
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,000
Let me break the wood

322
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,240
with my iron palm.

323
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,950
Great.

324
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,790
Come on.

325
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,240
Bravo, bravo!

326
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,630
That was incredible.

327
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,870
Alright, come on.

328
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,120
Let's welcome our next contestant.

329
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,270
Alright.

330
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,080
For everyone here,

331
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,120
I'll perform a piece

332
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,440
of Western Regions dance.

333
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,510
Alright.

334
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,600
Du Ruofeng, we'll go wild with you!

335
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,360
Changyi even has such a man?

336
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,510
Ruofeng.

337
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,750
I'm cheering for you!

338
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,320
Great!

339
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,190
I know your kindness

340
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,150
is truly hard to refuse today.

341
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,550
But I ask everyone here

342
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,410
to calm your restless hearts

343
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,080
and steady your trembling hands,

344
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,550
and let us together look forward

345
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,910
to the contestants'

346
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,970
wonderful performances.

347
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,840
Great.

348
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,750
(Qingge Tavern)
Once everyone likes horses,

349
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,240
the price of horses will naturally rise.

350
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,110
By then,

351
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,750
everyone will cherish horses

352
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,120
and raise horses.

353
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
If we make a profit,

354
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,790
we can even bring top-quality stallions

355
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,200
from the Western Regions

356
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,240
to improve our local breed.

357
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Mm.

358
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,000
Heng makes good sense.

359
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,620
Only the wealthy and noble come here.

360
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,760
You only earn

361
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,390
from the wealthy

362
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,930
and not from the people, huh?

363
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,470
Brilliant.

364
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,670
We'll see if it's brilliant later.

365
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,030
Right now, I just want

366
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,270
to free the Duke.

367
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,360
Now, let's welcome Lady Qingge
to perform for us.

368
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,480
Great.

369
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,870
Alas.

370
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,320
It makes me want to give the girls
two Carnival Gifts.

371
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,510
Just two?

372
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,630
I'd say at least ten.

373
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,150
That'd better suit your noble status.

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,170
Hey.

375
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,880
You're actually going for it?

376
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,130
Then make it at least 20.

377
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,560
Great, great.

378
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,320
Please give me your support.

379
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,390
Sure, sure.

380
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,270
Alright, everyone.

381
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,200
Both ladies have finished
their performances.

382
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,360
I think

383
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,790
it's time for everyone

384
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,080
to cast their votes.

385
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,750
Yes, cast our votes!

386
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,280
Cast our votes!

387
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,480
Top Patron,

388
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
where are the ten Carnival Gifts
you promised?

389
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,550
No rush.

390
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,270
I'll send Lady Miaomiao
three Triple Sixes.

391
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,360
(Triple Sixes)
Thanks for the three Triple Sixes.

392
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,550
Good for Mr. Liu.

393
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,270
Lady Qingge

394
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,670
seems to be falling far behind.

395
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,550
I believe right now,

396
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,790
Lady Qingge should also have
her Top Patron.

397
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
Don't you all agree?

398
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,150
Yes!

399
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,350
That's right!

400
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,910
Defend the championship!

401
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,360
If you haven't voted for Miaomiao,
come on now.

402
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,750
20 Carnival Gifts for Qingge.

403
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,380
20 Carnival Gifts.

404
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,440
Great, great.

405
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,120
20 Carnival Gifts.

406
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,420
(Carnival Gift)
Great, great.

407
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,320
It's for Lady Qingge,
the Chen contestant.

408
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,320
Everyone,

409
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,840
I declare:

410
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,870
Lady Qingge

411
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,120
has claimed the top spot.

412
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,720
She earns a place
in the preliminary horse race.

413
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,020
Good.

414
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,380
Good.

415
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,760
- 15.
- No.

416
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,000
15.

417
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Here, drink.

418
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,840
Drink.

419
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,150
You lost.

420
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
This 15-20 game was your idea.

421
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,940
Besides,

422
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,520
aren't you an Immortal?

423
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,080
How could you not foresee this?

424
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,790
I'm just indulging you out of joy.

425
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
Here, take it.

426
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,710
Oh.

427
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,720
If the equine administration does well,

428
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,620
there will be rich rewards.

429
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,110
You're starting to sound like the Duke.

430
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,770
Careful, or I'll report you.

431
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,890
Go on, keep playing.

432
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,970
No, I'm done.

433
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,920
I'm done drinking, too.

434
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,030
Just let me

435
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,520
rest in this scent of copper coins

436
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,470
and drift peacefully to sleep.

437
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,600
Such small ambitions.

438
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,180
Never seen money before, have you?

439
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,060
That's right.

440
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,590
I'm no royalty or nobility

441
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,570
who grew up in comfort and luxury.

442
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,260
Commoners like us

443
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,140
take life's beatings day after day.

444
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
It's all the same.

445
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,180
Duke.

446
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,510
Slow down; don't trip.

447
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,080
I command you to play with me.

448
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,390
Humph.

449
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,920
Who are you?

450
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,710
My mother delivers vegetables here.

451
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,920
She brought me in.

452
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,220
- You like it?
- Mm.

453
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,710
Then it's yours.

454
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,230
Thank you.

455
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,720
That makes us good friends now.

456
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,870
Next time you're at South Market Street,

457
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,710
just say you're looking for Zhao Wu.

458
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,630
We'll play again.

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Deal.

460
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,030
- I'll bring more toys.
- Okay.

461
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,180
Why are you playing here?

462
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,230
Come with me.

463
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,320
Don't forget.

464
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,720
Have you seen Zhao Wu?

465
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,440
Zhao Wu's whole family
was slain by Liu He.

466
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Liu He is truly vicious.

467
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,950
Parentless

468
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,910
and ill-bred!

469
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,790
A snot-nosed duke!

470
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,630
Right.

471
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,080
Parentless and ill-bred!

472
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,480
- Not true.
- A snot-nosed duke!

473
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,000
That's not true.

474
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,780
Parentless!

475
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,830
He's not that kind of man.

476
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,240
- And ill-bred!
- That's not true.

477
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,610
A snot-nosed duke!

478
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,240
How can you defend Liu He?

479
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,380
The Duke is over there.

480
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
Let me go.

481
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,310
Disrespecting the Duke.

482
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,260
- Punish them.
- Don't.

483
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,590
- Take them away.
- Let me go!

484
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,800
Don't take them.

485
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,480
- Don't take them!
- Let go of me.

486
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,400
Please forgive us for being late.

487
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,690
Zhao Wu's break-in broke the rules.

488
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,890
Those wild children insulted you.

489
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,240
That's even worse.

490
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,480
They can't be forgiven.

491
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,700
Duke, do not grieve.

492
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,070
The rules you speak of

493
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,680
are the very ones
that get people killed.

494
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,800
Why should I follow them?

495
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,310
(Over a decade has passed.)

496
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,500
(Yet I still can't leave Changyi.)

497
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,340
(Even if I left the fief,)

498
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,370
(I'd be sentenced
to a grave punishment.)

499
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,180
(Time to take a gamble.)

500
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,720
(If the Qilin can grant wishes,)

501
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,110
(I just wish everyone could forget me)

502
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,000
(or go somewhere no one knows me.)

503
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,490
