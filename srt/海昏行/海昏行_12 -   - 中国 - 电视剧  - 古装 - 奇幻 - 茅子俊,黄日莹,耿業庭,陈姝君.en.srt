=Episode 12=

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I have uncovered the truth
in Lord Wang's case.

31
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,920
It was all a trap set by this man.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,690
The evidence is irrefutable.

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,680
Duke, you're wise indeed.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,710
This man dared to frame an official.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,250
By law, he should be executed.

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,260
Why not let the court convict him?

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
He is a man from Changyi.

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,590
I failed to discipline him.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,760
I am the Duke of Changyi.

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
Leave him

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,000
to me.

42
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,550
This...

43
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,190
Very well.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,350
Then I'll report the truth to the court.

45
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,630
In that case,

46
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,590
can Wang Heng be released now?

47
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,090
Of course.

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,120
Release him at once.

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,310
Guards! Release him!

50
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,240
I'm free now?

51
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,450
Is everything clear?

52
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,310
Lord Wang, you have suffered.

53
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,530
It's him.

54
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,030
Should I call you Bushi now

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,310
or Shan?

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
My name is

57
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,310
Chen

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,590
Shan.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,970
Why did you frame Heng?

60
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,440
I was jealous.

61
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,310
Wang Heng.

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,280
Why does everyone hold you
in such high regard?

63
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,190
I've served

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,150
by the Duke's side for years,

65
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,000
yet the Duke values you more.

66
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,190
In the court of Chang'an,

67
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,750
I've worked with all my heart and soul,

68
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,360
but no one ever noticed me.

69
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
Then you showed up,

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,490
and suddenly everyone favored you.

71
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,240
Why is that?

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,080
Is it just because you bear
the destiny of the Qilin?

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,680
So, out of jealousy,

74
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,420
you tried to kill

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,670
the woman we saved?

76
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,930
I didn't kill anyone.

77
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,470
Then why did you walk
into her room with a dagger?

78
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,630
I was desperate and reckless.

79
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,040
In the end, I wasn't able
to harm her before I was caught.

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,940
But one woman did lose her life.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,430
It wasn't me who killed her.

82
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,430
I have no idea

83
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,270
how she died.

84
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,480
Who's the one behind you?

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
Who exactly is backing you?

86
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,570
You shadowy scoundrel.

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,720
Speak!

88
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,290
Knowing it won't do you any good.

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Duke.

90
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,830
I've shown you enough mercy.

91
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,720
Hyah!

92
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,500
Hyah!

93
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,310
Hyah!

94
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,750
I just remembered something.

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,950
What is it?

96
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,390
The first time I met him,

97
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,040
it was just like now.

98
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,660
That day,

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,390
I slipped out of the city,

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,360
and Lord Gong dragged me back again.

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
I got on the carriage,

102
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,620
and that brat was sitting right there.

103
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,570
Guess what he was doing.

104
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,100
- What?
- Reading.

105
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,110
Reading?

106
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,160
From that day on,

107
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,190
Lord Gong had him follow
your lord everywhere

108
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,630
to keep an eye on me while I read.

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,650
Oh, well.

110
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,610
I was furious, really.

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,640
"Your lord"?

112
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,610
It means me.

113
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,520
Out, brat.

114
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,590
And then?

115
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,210
Later on,

116
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,340
he escaped the city with me.

117
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,430
He's not like other study companions.

118
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,970
He didn't care for being confined
to the academy.

119
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,450
Much like me.

120
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
In fact,

121
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,160
my impression of Chang'an
also came from him.

122
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,800
Once,

123
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,390
he came back from Chang'an

124
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,480
and told me
about its bustling streets and sights.

125
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,610
From the moment I stepped into Changyi,

126
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,550
my mission to keep watch had begun.

127
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,250
No,

128
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,480
to me,

129
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,690
it was the start of our friendship.

130
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,560
I've imagined this very scene

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,030
before me countless times.

132
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,830
You standing before me,

133
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,360
demanding answers,

134
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
and asking why I spied on you

135
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,510
and why

136
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,140
I betrayed you.

137
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,270
Now, that day has finally come.

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,070
To my surprise,

139
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,780
I feel strangely calm and at ease.

140
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,370
Hyah!

141
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,650
Hyah!

142
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,080
Shan is gone.

143
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,510
Our brotherhood has come to an end.

144
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,240
Go now.

145
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,590
Hide your name and your past.

146
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,240
The farther you go, the better.

147
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,020
I've made arrangements
for the young lady.

148
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,140
Someone will protect her

149
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,290
until she's fully recovered.

150
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,610
I'll wait for you at the gate.

151
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,450
Sure.

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,870
I understand how you feel.

153
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,730
Fate can be cruel.

154
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,380
But as long as Shan still lives,

155
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,100
the Mandate of Heaven
has already shifted.

156
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,980
From this moment on,

157
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,520
our destiny is ours to command.

158
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,490
Let us hope so.

159
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,500
Duke.

160
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,360
All is prepared.

161
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,230
We can set out now.

162
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,440
Lord Gong.

163
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,720
I have a favor to ask.

164
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,440
Please speak, Lord Wang.

165
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,260
If Lady De Jiu hadn't risked her life,

166
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,910
I wouldn't have survived,

167
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,420
and the Duke's reputation would suffer.

168
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,830
Lord Gong,

169
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,220
please let her stay.

170
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,550
My senior is skilled in martial arts.

171
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,970
If she stays, she can protect me.

172
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,610
I understand.

173
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,790
With Lady De Jiu here,

174
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,390
she will surely safeguard

175
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,270
Lord Wang's safety.

176
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,510
Thanks, Lord Gong.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Let's go.

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Who's there?

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,900
Chen.

180
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,060
We used to be brothers.

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,010
I should see you off.

182
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,510
Who told you to act on your own?

183
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,150
The court only ordered you
to investigate,

184
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,970
not to frame others.

185
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,230
You...

186
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,200
Zhang Sheng.

187
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,630
Those who act on their own

188
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,840
always end up like this.

189
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,160
Lord Zhang, you are decisive.

190
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,600
He failed two tasks

191
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,060
at hand

192
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,360
and nearly exposed me.

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Milord,

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,030
how do we report this to our superiors?

195
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,540
When passing through Hongnong,

196
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,390
the Duke of Changyi ordered Shan
to drive the ladies.

197
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,750
Once this was discovered,

198
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,960
the Duke of Changyi denied it,

199
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,430
had Shan arrested,

200
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
and handed him to the Chief Guard
for execution.

201
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,440
(When passing through Hongnong,)

202
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,390
You're truly wise.

203
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,520
(... ordered Shan to drive the ladies.)

204
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,790
(At Hu,)

205
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,010
(the envoy reproached An Le.)

206
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,010
(An Le reported to Gong Sui.)

207
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,360
(Gong Sui questioned the Duke.)

208
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,530
(The Duke)

209
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,530
(denied it.)

210
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,710
(Gong Sui said,)

211
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,670
("If not,")

212
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,270
("why favor Shan so
as to ruin justice and honor?")

213
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,810
("Please arrest him")

214
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,630
("to clear your name.")

215
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,750
(Thus, Shan was seized and executed.)

216
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,220
(From Volume XVI, Annals of Han,
Zizhi Tongjian.)

217
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,520
We'll be in Chang'an soon.

218
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,840
Why did Bushi suddenly return
to Changyi?

219
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,360
Duke, what secret mission
did you give him?

220
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,600
Since it's a secret mission,

221
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,310
how could I tell you?

222
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,870
You have a mission, too.

223
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,870
What mission?

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
To safeguard our realm

225
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,960
and the Liu's reign.

226
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,870
It's our duty.

227
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,550
Lord Wang, you don't look well.

228
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,080
Is your health troubling you?

229
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,290
It's nothing.

230
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,390
We're getting close to Chang'an.

231
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,020
I just feel a little uneasy.

232
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,390
How can you say so?

233
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,990
At such a crucial moment,

234
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,030
your health is of the utmost importance.

235
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
We must be careful.

236
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,200
Lord Gong.

237
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,840
He's about to delay the journey.

238
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,620
Shouldn't that call
for a word of caution?

239
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,750
The Duke's kindness toward officials

240
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,240
is a blessing.

241
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,040
Lord Wang.

242
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,290
You must rest well.

243
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,320
Once in Chang'an,
we'll be relying on you a great deal.

244
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,580
(Hongnong Lodge)

245
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,780
(Wucheng Village, Hu County)

246
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,140
Let me help you.

247
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,140
(Wucheng Village)

248
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,510
Wucheng Village.

249
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,510
Let's go.

250
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,110
Everyone,

251
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,210
we are passing through here

252
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,060
and need a short rest.

253
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,480
- Don't worry.
- We won't intrude.

254
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,320
It's all right.

255
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,270
(Ren Xuan, Village Chief)
I am Ren Xuan, the Village Chief.

256
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,200
Everyone,

257
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,670
though gold is cheesy,

258
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,800
we do have to trouble you.

259
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,810
This is a small token.

260
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,870
Please accept it.

261
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,120
No need; make yourself at home.

262
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,940
I'll arrange a few empty houses for you.

263
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,080
I hope you won't mind.

264
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,300
- Please.
- How impressive.

265
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,300
Everyone, you may leave.

266
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,110
- Alright.
- Let's go.

267
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Please.

268
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,750
What are you doing?

269
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,110
Heng.

270
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,080
Come.

271
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,920
Sit here.

272
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,710
What are you doing?

273
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,910
Come on, put your legs up.

274
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,750
Get some proper rest.

275
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,350
Take a short nap.

276
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,320
Here, lie down.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,960
How can I sleep
when it's still bright outside?

278
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,430
Close your eyes,

279
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,320
and then it'll be dark.

280
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,910
Come on, close your eyes.

281
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,850
Sleep is about to overtake you.

282
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,390
I can't sleep at all.

283
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,950
Who naps here in broad daylight?

284
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,810
I spent a hefty sum

285
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,040
to buy you some peaceful rest.

286
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,200
Did he take your money?

287
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,090
He refused; what's it to me?

288
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,270
Come on, do me a favor.

289
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,120
Yes, lie down.

290
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,090
Please, just this once.

291
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,460
Good.

292
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,060
What are you doing here?

293
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,100
Why are you still here?

294
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Attentive in every way.

295
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,550
Always ready to help.

296
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,710
Go, go, go.

297
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,340
With you here, I get the chills.

298
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,910
Alright, alright.

299
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,430
Sorry about that.

300
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,370
Got it.

301
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,520
Senior, where are you going?

302
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,110
Qingge.

303
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,960
Qingge.

304
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,060
What happened?

305
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,150
How's Wang?

306
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,570
He's doing fine.

307
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,640
Why do I feel

308
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,640
something's off with you?

309
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
It's nothing.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,920
I just want to rest
after the long journey.

311
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,300
Hey, let's chat for a bit.

312
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,290
