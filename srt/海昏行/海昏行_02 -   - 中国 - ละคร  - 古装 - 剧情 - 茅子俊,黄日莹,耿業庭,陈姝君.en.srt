(What's going on?)

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,120
Heng!

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,000
(Did I die and come back?)

33
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,630
(I get it now.)

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,740
(Oh, my.)

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,280
(My injuries healed, and I was reborn.)

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,760
(That's like playing with cheats.)

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
Heng.

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
I'll wait for your word.

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,350
Lord Gong.

40
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,790
It's me; open the door.

41
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,750
(Forget it.)

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,870
Lord Gong, Lord Gong.

43
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,480
Coming.

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,230
About this Qilin matter...

45
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,370
Hey.

46
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,040
We can't discuss it here.

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,420
Let's speak in the study.

48
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,260
- Hey.
- Let's go.

49
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,970
No, we'll talk right here.

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,200
Right here in the hall.

51
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,340
Let your scolding cut deep

52
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,430
into my bones.

53
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,460
Fine, since that's how it is,

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,700
I must speak frankly today.

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,370
Why did you set an altar by the river?

56
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,740
And why invite that so-called Immortal?

57
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you truly believe in such hearsay?

58
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,960
Honestly, Lord Gong,

59
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,700
I've been missing

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,430
my late father deeply.

61
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,280
By chance,
I stumbled upon this bronze Qilin.

62
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,540
I heard

63
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,340
it can turn back time

64
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,630
and grant eternal life.

65
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,630
I wish to see my father.

66
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,500
Do you know

67
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,930
the origin of this bronze Qilin?

68
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,600
I recall it was gifted
by Grandfather to Grandmother

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,980
and then passed down to my father.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,100
Your grandmother
was gravely ill back then.

71
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,340
Your grandfather
was deeply devoted to her.

72
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,700
Of course, he believed such hearsay.

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,620
There's no such thing as immortality
in this world.

74
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,740
Assassins! Assassins!

75
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,860
Protect the Duke!

76
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,700
He's been caught?

77
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,090
The assassin was slain on the spot.

78
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,180
Ah?

79
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,380
(20th day of the 5th month, 74 BC)

80
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,350
Heng.

81
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,140
Heng.

82
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,810
Heng.

83
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,070
(Again?)

84
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,960
Heng.

85
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,530
(Dying each time is unbearable.)

86
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,260
(I can't keep going like this.)

87
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,660
(I need to plan this carefully.)

88
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
You're not sneaking in?

89
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,500
Let's take a gamble.

90
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,540
I'll go through the front gate.

91
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,360
So bold and blatant?

92
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,480
(I can restart anytime;
what's there to fear?)

93
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,180
Ever heard of the invisibility spell?

94
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,440
I'm eager to see it.

95
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,660
Lord Gong.

96
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,540
It's me.

97
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,520
Hurry, open the door!

98
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,320
Coming.

99
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,460
(Where is he?)

100
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,620
- It's so late...
- Sorry

101
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,660
to disturb your peace.

102
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,900
I admit I've been
far too reckless lately.

103
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,680
It leaves me uneasy at heart.

104
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,280
No one is without fault after all.

105
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,300
Yes, yes.

106
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,060
It matters that you can correct
your mistakes.

107
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,600
Of course, I'll make amends.

108
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,660
I lost my parents.

109
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,840
(Two patrol squads outside.)

110
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,260
- Your words
- (Four per squad.)

111
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,380
- are like a father's counsel.
- (10 seconds to go.)

112
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,560
You flatter me.

113
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,620
Please.

114
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,270
(Inner shifts last 20 seconds.)

115
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,820
(Lord Gong's office is rather simple.)

116
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,720
Six, five.

117
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,950
Four.

118
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,840
Three.

119
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,940
Two, one.

120
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,820
Go.

121
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,580
(Guards will pass the doorway)

122
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,420
(in three seconds.)

123
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,860
(Look back.)

124
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,920
(Right.)

125
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,950
(Left.)

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,140
(Right.)

127
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,150
(Left.)

128
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,380
(Turn.)

129
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,700
(Turn again.)

130
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,020
(Turn around. Bye.)

131
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
What's wrong?

132
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,840
I keep feeling
like someone's following us.

133
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,480
Stop looking; it's eerie at night.

134
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,420
Come on.

135
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,340
Your grandmother
was gravely ill back then.

136
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,310
Your grandfather
was deeply devoted to her.

137
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,880
Of course, he believed such hearsay.

138
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,130
There's no such thing as immortality
in this world.

139
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,550
At last, I can sleep in peace.

140
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,980
Duke, Duke.

141
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,340
One more thing.

142
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,180
Tell me next time.

143
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,460
Next time.

144
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,340
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

145
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,550
(No way to return.)

146
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,000
(I can only go to Chang'an
to reclaim the Qilin)

147
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,420
(and settle scores with San.)

148
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
(How did she get here anyway?)

149
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,380
Heng.

150
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Has it all gone smoothly?

151
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,860
The permits are done.

152
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
What's wrong with you?

153
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,180
It's nothing. Let's go.

154
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,660
Let's go back
and plan our trip to Chang'an.

155
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,020
How are you?

156
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,700
You're too heavy to be an Immortal.

157
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,420
You must've fallen from the heavens.

158
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,380
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

159
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,300
Whoa.

160
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Lord Chen.

161
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Lord Gong,
the Duke is messing around again?

162
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,490
We can't afford to be careless now.

163
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,760
What do you want?

164
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,140
Burn the bridge after crossing it?

165
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,030
Silence the witness?

166
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,000
- For you.
- What?

167
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,430
Your short hair
draws too much attention.

168
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,140
After thinking it over,

169
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,980
this one

170
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,290
is the most practical

171
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
and precious.

172
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,450
Let me tell you this:

173
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,460
Our body and hair
are gifts from our parents.

174
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,220
Cutting hair is like cutting one's head.

175
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,440
Such bonds are like those forged
in life and death.

176
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,940
Will you do it yourselves,

177
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,340
or should I do it for you?

178
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,280
Duke.

179
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,340
We've done nothing wrong!

180
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,220
Can't we talk?

181
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,740
- Why act like this?
- Looks like

182
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,980
I'll have to handle it myself.

183
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,970
(Zhang Sheng, Chen Bushi, Li Qi)

184
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,760
(Well, at least I've got a wig.)

185
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,340
(I was worrying about this earlier.)

186
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,290
(I didn't expect Qi Chang)

187
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
(to be so considerate.)

188
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,660
Now, we have the travel permits.

189
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,100
But let me remind you:

190
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,540
The road to Chang'an is long.

191
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,100
How will we manage food and lodging?

192
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,860
How about expenses on the way?

193
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,540
Mm.

194
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,900
Will this be enough?

195
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,380
(Oh, my.)

196
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,340
(Gold biscuit.)

197
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,100
(This guy must know Liu He.)

198
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,140
I fear

199
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,540
it won't suffice.

200
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,620
I still have

201
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,580
a few more.

202
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,880
How about

203
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,040
we go take a look?

204
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,120
Let's go see.

205
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,700
Come on.

206
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,960
(This...)

207
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,660
(Wow...)

208
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,510
(This...)

209
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,440
(Aren't these the ones in the museum)

210
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,940
(that you can only view through glass)

211
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,160
(and can't even touch at all?)

212
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,100
(Why are they piled here
like common greens?)

213
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,990
(And I'm allowed to touch them freely?)

214
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
(Oh, my heavens!)

215
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,660
(The perks of time travel are too real!)

216
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,820
They're all yours?

217
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,300
Heng.

218
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,040
Will this be enough
for the trip to Chang'an?

219
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,300
Yes, yes.

220
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,540
That's more than enough.

221
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,780
A coffin like this

222
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,020
not only shields us

223
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,970
but can also hide

224
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,450
the man without an identity.

225
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,960
Most importantly,

226
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
he can keep our travel funds safe.

227
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,700
Brilliant.

228
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,740
Truly ingenious.

229
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,420
Follow me out of the city.

230
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,540
Move.

231
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,000
We're at a funeral; be serious.

232
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,100
Mind your demeanor.

233
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,560
You too, get back in there. Lie down.

234
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,820
I'm playing my part.

235
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,160
With so much money beside me,

236
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,480
I could rest in peace with a smile.

237
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,920
- Go.
- Go.

238
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,090
Halt.

239
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,200
Another funeral procession?

240
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,640
Why have there been so many lately?

241
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,220
Sir, this is a permit from Lord Gong.

242
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,460
Sir, you may not be aware.

243
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,370
There's been a contagious disease.

244
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,690
The whole family dies together.

245
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,860
It's something that spreads.

246
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,600
That's uncanny.

247
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,450
Hurry, hurry.

248
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,500
Don't let it spread to us.

249
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,590
It feels different outside the city.

250
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,620
Look.

251
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,420
Do you see that?

252
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,870
These rivers and mountains.

253
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,260
The splendor beyond Changyi.

254
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,480
Leaving the city

255
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,120
is the first step.

256
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,430
Go buy this carriage at once.

257
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,180
- Go.
- You two, go.

258
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,050
Go, go, go.

259
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,920
Faster.

260
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,470
Offer him any price he asks.

261
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,650
Got it.

262
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,970
Qi,

263
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,110
while clutching these gold biscuits,

264
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,810
I can't help but wonder two things.

265
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,800
First,

266
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,280
are you well acquainted with Liu He?

267
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,220
Keep your voice down.

268
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,440
You're a corpse now.

269
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,140
Second,

270
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,420
since you know Lord Gong,

271
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,620
could it be that you're...?

272
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,560
You surely talk a lot.

273
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,700
I just got here,

274
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,940
so I don't know the situation.

275
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,230
You report.

276
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,120
No, I won't.

277
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,420
What happened?

278
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,700
Where's the carriage?

279
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,540
You should go

280
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,500
and talk about it yourself.

281
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,590
Didn't I say to agree
to whatever price he asks?

282
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,140
Just name your price.

283
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,630
I'll buy it no matter the cost.

284
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,150
Duke.

285
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,830
Please, come back with me.

286
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,520
Let's sit and talk.

287
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,550
What's going on?

288
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,120
Is the Duke you mentioned Liu He?

289
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,500
- Come out.
- Take them all back.

290
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,860
Did he leave the city with us?

291
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,020
Qi Chang, say something.

292
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,540
(Changyi Gate)

293
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
Lord Gong.

294
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,440
They've been kneeling for so long.

295
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,050
First, they believed rumors.

296
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,830
Then they stole my seal with a vagrant

297
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,340
and stirred up

298
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,540
this whole shameful mess.

299
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,060
I only wish to live a life of freedom

300
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,740
and become a wandering hero.

301
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,060
Why not seize the chance?

302
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,220
Right now in Chang'an,

303
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,280
the winds of power shift endlessly.

304
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,660
His Majesty lies gravely ill.

305
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,880
Every word and move you make

306
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,660
is under the court's gaze.

307
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,230
One day...

308
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,540
Lord Gong,

309
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,140
how dare you

310
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,940
speak of that?

311
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,260
Acting with the tide is the wiser path.

312
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,100
Do not be misled by petty schemers.

313
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,060
At such a critical moment,

314
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,060
if you lose your clarity,

315
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,180
the loss will outweigh the gain.

316
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,060
What plans are in motion in Chang'an?

317
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,900
Now that His Majesty is gravely ill,

318
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,380
what Chang'an needs is

319
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,390
an obedient heir

320
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,700
with a few achievements.

321
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,180
Equine administration

322
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,870
is a key policy of the Han.

323
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,780
Lord Gong.

324
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,360
You know what must be done.

325
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,500
At this moment,

326
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,320
the equine administration

327
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,160
will strengthen your power.

328
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,340
Why execute me?

329
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,240
What crime have I committed?

330
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,890
Spreading deceitful words

331
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,080
and swaying the Duke's will.

332
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,040
That is a capital crime.

333
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
This was all Qi Chang's doing.

334
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,200
I've never met the Duke.

335
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,650
When have I ever swayed him?

336
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,150
You must've caught the wrong person.

337
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,160
Go, hurry.

338
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,520
You are Wang Heng?

339
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,060
(Xu Qingge)

340
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,220
(Order)

341
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,220
- Let him go.
- Yes.

342
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,030
Qi Chang's friend?

343
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,140
And you are?

344
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,920
Qi has already pleaded for you.

345
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,420
If you wish to live,

346
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,060
you just need to do one thing.

347
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,870
What is it?

348
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,220
Equine administration.

349
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,180
What?

350
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,350
You don't know,

351
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,260
so you can't do that.

352
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,460
So, that's a no.

353
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,830
Take him out and behead him.

354
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,780
I know.

355
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
I can do this.

356
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,780
I agree.

357
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,380
Alright, release him.

358
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

359
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,860
Hurry, hurry.

360
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,180
Hurry.

361
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,250
You can let me go?

362
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,940
Seems like in Changyi,

363
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,700
you're quite an influential figure.

364
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,240
I'm Xu Qingge.

365
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,700
Just like Qi,

366
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,530
I'm also the Duke's confidant.

367
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,660
Come with me.

368
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,820
So,

369
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,020
you agreed then.

370
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,220
Hey.

371
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,650
Isn't this the Duke's confidant?

372
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,970
Since you're here,

373
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,700
why not explain yourself?

374
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,480
You should thank me first.

375
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,900
I pleaded for you

376
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,350
and said you were worth keeping.

377
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,540
That's how you were spared.

378
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,480
Why didn't you tell me

379
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,820
you took the Duke out of the city?

380
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,040
I need to see the Duke.

381
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,920
The Duke isn't someone you can meet.

382
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,320
If I meet the Duke,

383
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,820
I promise

384
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,620
everyone will be able to go to Chang'an.

385
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,700
(He doesn't even know I'm the Duke)

386
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,440
(and dares to try and fool me.)

387
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,580
You won't get to see him.

388
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,420
Why not?

389
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,770
His intent to leave was exposed.

390
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,300
He's now in seclusion for reflection.

391
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,380
No one gets to see him.

392
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,270
Really?

393
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,340
(She made that up.)

394
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,340
(And you bought it.)

395
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,470
Qingge.

396
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,660
Go fetch a horse.

397
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,860
Just now, you said

398
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,700
that if you saw the Duke,

399
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,600
we could go to Chang'an?

400
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,720
Soon, the Duke will be able to go

401
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,390
to Chang'an with full honor.
