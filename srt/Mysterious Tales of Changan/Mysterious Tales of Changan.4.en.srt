Sister, hurry up.

00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,842
Brother, wait for me.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,466
It has been lying here for a long time.
Do you think it is sick?

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,670
It broke a wing.
It won't be able to fly anymore.

5
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:20,090
(That was the last time
Ruyan saw her brother.)

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,248
Then she was taken by
her father to Zuihua House

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,860
and sold to Madam Su.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,189
After that,

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,500
her father, brother
and mother all left here.

10
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:36,481
It's getting dark. I should go back.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,584
I heard that Zuihua House is holding
a ritual to exorcise evil spirits.

12
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:43,246
Are you sure you want to go back now?

13
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:45,980
It's better to face it than to avoid it.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,664
Besides,

15
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:49,000
I was Ruyan's only friend.

16
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:50,794
Where can I hide?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,460
It's all right.

18
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53,300
Let us escort you back.

19

Liu Ruyan, you wish!
Go to hell!

23
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,040
You deserve to die. You're a slut.

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,060
You can't take my life.
Never. I'll seal you up.

I curse you to death with this talisman.

Liu Ruyan, I don't care if
you are a human or a ghost.

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,598
I will make sure you
can't be reincarnated

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,802
nor rest in peace.

30
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,710
I'll seal you completely.

31
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:56,565
No.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,820
No. Ruyan, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,112
Please spare me.

34
00:02:01,376 --> 00:02:03,293
What happened a year ago was my fault.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,860
I beg you. Please spare me.

36
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,660
Ruyan, please forgive me.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,466
Don't stop. Please don't stop.

38

Don't get distracted. Recite the Sutra.

She's here.

42

in this world.

Don't be afraid.

This is just someone's trick.

46
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:38,072
Maybe

47
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,498
she's around.

Be careful, ladies.

Madam.

Is this what you were talking about?

54
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,520
This looks like a poison.

55
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,392
This is a breakthrough.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,797
Great.
