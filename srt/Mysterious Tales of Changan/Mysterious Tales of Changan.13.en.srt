00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,021
(The mysterious death of a visiting envoy
is a matter of great importance.)

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:05,168
"This case is weird. Please help me."

3
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:07,586
It is indeed weird.

4
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:09,770
Is he really the Crown Prince?

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,860
What a big liar.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,512
You didn't believe him

7
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:15,570
when he said he was a prince.

8
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:16,264
I was...

9
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,274
Let's talk about the case.

10
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:19,624
Ada was in the east wing

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,256
for about four hours or so

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,642
and it snowed

13
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:24,090
the whole time.

14
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,570
When the Crown Prince and
the others arrived at the scene,

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,480
there were no footprints
in the snow outside.

16
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,088
If it was murder,

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,477
how did the culprit get in
and out of the east wing?

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,970
Whether accidental or murderous,

19
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,765
the death of the Wolves'
envoy in the Eastern Palace

20
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,010
is a serious matter.

21
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,260
The empire is on the verge
of war with the Wolves.

22
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,650
If this matter is not handled well,

23
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,050
it will be a disaster for both
the Crown Prince and our nation.

24
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,650
His Majesty

25
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,357
did not receive them personally

26
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,296
because he was not feeling well,

27
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,190
but such an incident...

28
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,340
If this is really murder,

29
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,269
then the murderer must
be up to something else.

30
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,490
What's your plan?

31
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,048
I'm in prison.

32
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,420
I can't help much.

33
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,776
Master, you should hurry back
and help the Crown Prince.

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,530
Take another look at the scene

35
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,530
and you'll find something.

36
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:14,442
All right.

=Episode 13=

39
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,080
Your Highness.

40
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,353
In recent years,

41
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,101
our clan has been at
odds with your empire

42
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,186
and both sides have
suffered great losses.

43
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,253
Hence,

44
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,373
the king has sent us

45
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:49,900
to make peace with goodwill.

46
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,090
However, the death of our
envoy in the Eastern Palace

47
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,410
must be accounted for.

48
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,610
Well said.

49
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,794
As you said, both sides
have suffered losses,

50
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:06,514
but in the details of this peace talk,

51
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,380
you asked for a union, ceded land

52
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,130
and annual gifts of
gold, silver and silk.

53
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,469
I reckon

54
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,000
this isn't a peace deal.

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,466
It's a robbery.

56
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:20,613
This is not a battlefield.

57
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,610
Don't break the peace.

58
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,340
It's all negotiable.

59
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,965
Eunuch Cui.

60
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,240
How can we negotiate

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,570
something like cession?

62
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:30,090
This...

63
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,300
General Zan Lie.

64
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:37,000
All of our people

65
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,970
will not retreat from
their own territory.

66
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,901
I have an idea.

67
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,740
General, go on.

68
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,704
If there is no answer for the death

69
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,794
of my clan's Ada in the East Palace,

70
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,558
why don't you come with me to our Clan

71
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,490
and apologise to our people?

72
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,000
Then this peace talk

73
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,220
can be further discussed.

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,778
What?

75
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,333
You want to take the Crown Prince?

76
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,570
How outrageous!

77
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,277
So it's a no?

78
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,574
Ridiculous!

79
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:23,680
If you want war, bring it on!

80
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,000
Official Chu from Court of
Judicial Review is here.

81
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,440
Let her in.

82
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,170
Yes.

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,000
I have been informed of the case.

84
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,490
I need to go to the east wing
to see the crime scene.

85
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,909
Maybe it's snowing outside

86
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,456
and the snow is melting

87
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,780
and flowing into the room.

88
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,420
(Non-toxic.)

89
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:57,240
(There is a sweet smell.)

90
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,421
(Scattered sticks.)

91
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,820
(Smells like freshly cut wood.)

92
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:09,496
This east wing room
has been rarely visited.

93
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,544
There was a metal box

94
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,770
full of weights up here,

95
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,200
probably one hundred kilograms.

96
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,570
It hit him right on the head.

97
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,474
There were no footprints in
the snow before we arrived.

98
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,106
So no one must have been near.

99
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,690
The wall was always guarded from behind.

100
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,624
So it's not likely to
have fallen from there

101
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,381
or from above.

102
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:38,248
Then...

103
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,904
(Was that stick something out of the box)

104
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,336
(or...)

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,802
(No.)

106
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,493
(The legs of this table)

107
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,274
(also show signs of fresh cutting.)

108
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,100
This is a closed chamber.

109
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,701
If it was murder,

110
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,032
then the culprit was so meticulous

111
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,416
that it was hard to find fault.

112
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,970
Is she okay?

113
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:31,914
Zhang Xiaomeng.

114
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,976
She's fine.

115
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,397
I'm going to tell her
the results of the investigation.

116
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,696
She's so clever. She'll find
a breakthrough.

117
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:39,008
All right.

118
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:40,642
Tell her

119
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:42,533
I'll get her out.

120
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,653
Tell her not to worry,

121
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:46,176
to eat well

122
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,664
and not to catch a cold in prison.

123
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:52,989
You are familiar with that place.

124
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:54,637
Protect her.

125
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,301
Don't worry, Your Highness.
I will take care of her.

126
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:58,285
All right.

127
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,130
Hey!

128
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,605
The food is terrible.
Suspects are also human.

129
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,680
Who are you?

130
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,544
What's so funny?

131
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,669
Here. Eat this.

132
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,448
That's all I have, but you can have it.

133
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,650
Thanks.

134
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,640
You are Yao Zhan

135
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:40,672
Escort Yao?

136
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:44,010
Why are you here? We're worried sick.

137
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:45,122
I don't know what you're talking about.

138
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:47,949
I am a physician in the capital.

139
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,792
My name is Bai Yu.

140
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,000
I am not what you call

141
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,820
an escort.

142
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,690
You are obviously Escort Yao.

143
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,885
Why are you here?

144
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,440
I was in a hurry to treat a patient

145
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,933
and ran into a dignitary
in the street. So I was jailed.

146
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,245
I'm really not the Yao Zhan
you're talking about.

147
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,300
But my mother said

148
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:07,582
I had a twin brother who was
abducted and sold when I was a kid.

149
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,050
So maybe he's the one

150
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,010
you're talking about.

151
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:12,485
Well,

152
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,058
that's possible, isn't it?

153
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,786
(Li Xinghe said Yao Zhan's
whereabouts were unknown.)

154

155

(but he's not Yao Zhan.)

156

Prisoners, wake up!

157
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:26,056
Come on.

158

Wake up!

159
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,010
A new prisoner will arrive shortly.

160
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,658
We will reassign them
according to the list.

161

Come out.

162
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:39,080
Come on out.

163
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,992
Do you hear me?

(So fierce.)

165
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:47,557
Fire!

166
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,749
Go back in and stay inside.
