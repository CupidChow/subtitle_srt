00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,357
It seems that Shen Mei

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,120
was indeed attacked.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,040
Half a month ago,

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,680
my sister went to her room after dinner

5
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:09,240
and we all thought she'd gone to bed,

6
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:12,290
but then in the middle of the night,
she secretly packed up and snuck out.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,520
To me,

8
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:15,242
it was like she was eloping with someone

9
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,240
and never came back.

10
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:18,954
Do you know who she met up with?

11
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:21,554
She is introverted. The most
she could do was chores at the academy.

12
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:22,770
She wouldn't dare to go far.

13
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:25,914
We've checked the academy.

14
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,106
There's an alibi for
the day of the crime.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,536
Is she the family member
of the carriage burning case?

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,816
Officials, please do justice to Xiaohua.

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,640
So her name is Xiaohua.

20
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:00,120
Can you mark her recent movements?

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,381
Do you have something in mind?

22
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,090
Mark Shen Mei's recent
movements as well.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,560
All right.

This area.

27
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,338
The Sixth Prince's residence
is also in this area.

Li Xinghe.

31
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,809
You're awake.

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,445
What happened that day?

33
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:12,157
I was attacked that day when I arrived

34
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,864
in the woods with Yao.

35

(Young master, go!)

36
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,768
He stayed behind

37
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:23,674
to save me.

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,568
His life or death is still unknown,

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,194
but I will find him.

40
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,490
I've heard of your problem.

41
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,560
How can you find Shen Mei

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,160
if you're physically exhausted?

43
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:54,669
I don't even know
where to find the culprit.

44
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:57,661
Do you think he will return
to the scene of the crime?

45
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:03,861
Can I find Shen Mei?

46
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,954
Definitely.

47
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:09,077
I have faith in you.

48
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:13,802
You know what?

49
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm terrified.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,214
Terrified that one day

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,520
I'll see my friends and family

52
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,688
lying right in front of me

53
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,405
and have their bodies examined.

54
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,725
Looks like Shen's parents have not yet
returned from the magistrate's office.

55
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,693
Stop thinking about it.

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,568
Go to bed early.

57
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,770
You can't find the culprit after
getting a good night's sleep.

58
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,538
Do you think I can really find Shen Mei?

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sure you can.

60
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:04,888
Thank you.

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,850
I'll go back to my room first..

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,010
Goodnight.

(the only one who could bring him
to the climax of his fantasy trial.)

(So he changed his crime habits.)

(He'll be nervous, excited)

76

(and uneasy when facing
the perfect choice.)

77

(Such emotions might instead
keep him from striking so soon.)

89

if you dropped it.

90

Stop right there!

I'm 90% sure.
