1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,660
This is how the killer set up the scene.

2
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:06,968
To save time,

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,000
I had a basin of water poured
on the floor in advance.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,101
It's just about time.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,016
=Mysterious Tales of Chang'an=

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,030
=Episode 15=

7
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:27,250
Brilliant.

8
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:31,093
This matches up with all
the traces of the previous scene.

9
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:33,226
Sugar cubes

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,240
are readily available at the market.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,772
The female envoy carried
a sugar cube into the palace.

12
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:40,960
So the ants would go for her coat.

13
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:43,933
But

14
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,866
how did she get in through the snow

15
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:48,682
without a trace?

16
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:52,205
How can this be explained?

17
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,013
Let's start from the top.

18
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,070
(In the midst of the banquet,)

19
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,234
(thefemale envoy left alone)

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,677
(and entered the east wing)

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,150
(on stilts.)

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,856
(That's why there were no
footprints in the snow.)

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,192
(Then)

24
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:30,269
(she grievously wounded Ada)

25
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:32,060
(when he wasn't looking.)

26
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:39,669
(The setup)

27
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,064
(is next.)

28
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,120
(When the snow covered the ground,)

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,637
(the sugar cube melted,)

30
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:48,586
(the stick lost its balance)

31
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,637
(and the weight hit Ada.)

32
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:55,074
(Which is why the water stains
on the ground were non-toxic)

33
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,789
(but had a sweet smell.)

34
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:08,000
The court lady who had
gone to look for Ada

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,613
and all those who had
come to the east wing

36
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:14,000
had not noticed the small
holes in the snow.

37
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:16,600
After destroying the scene,

38
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:20,693
all you'll remember is that there
were no footprints in the snow.

39
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,389
As for the motive of the murder,

40
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,266
I think we can just ask the killer.

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,346
Bad news, Your Highness.

42
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,861
The female envoy is dead.

43
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,514
What?

44
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:37,738
You...

45
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,418
Crown Prince.

46
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:39,624
What exactly is going on?

47
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,664
General.

48
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,618
Don't worry.

49
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:42,901
I'll give you an explanation.

50
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,130
Chu Qi, can this be cracked?

51
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,184
I'll go to her.

52
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:52,157
Go ahead.

53
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:08,610
Hey.

54
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,940
Hey.

55
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,085
Yes, beauty?

56
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,181
Thank you for saving me.

57
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,504
Don't mention it.

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,762
However,

59
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,558
you're strong in martial arts,

60
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:26,506
but you're just an ordinary
physician in Yong'an City.

61
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,709
I don't believe it.

62
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:29,413
So what do you think I am?

63
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,493
Young lady killer

64
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:31,264
or

65
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,210
outsider assassin?

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,690
I think

67
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,216
you are a nice person.

68
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,016
Little cutie.

69
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:43,688
Your neck is still bleeding.

70
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:52,162
Plant ash can stop bleeding.

71
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,150
Turn around.

72
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,013
I heard what you just
said to your friend,

73
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:06,666
but I'm afraid

74
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,813
this murder

75
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,125
is not that simple.

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,146
You eavesdropped on us.

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,066
Don't move.

78
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,682
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on you.

79
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:18,186
I'm sure

80
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,141
you'll be out in no time.

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,618
You're smart enough, too.

82
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,312
I'm sure

83
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,096
you can solve this case.

84
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:27,912
Who are you really?

85
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,784
I told you.

86
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,181
I'm an ordinary physician.

87
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,669
But I'm smart enough.

88
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,864
Do you think

89
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,984
if I could join
Court of Judicial Review,

90
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,282
I could be

91
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,008
a detective too?

92
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,629
You're quite a braggart.

93
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:52,285
Master.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,824
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

95
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:56,952
The murderer is dead.

96
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,280
She may have been murdered.

97
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,770
This is the token the prince gave me.

98
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:09,100
He wanted you to enter the palace.

99
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:11,786
Beauty.

100
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,562
Don't you want to know

101
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:15,064
who just tried to kill you?

102
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,750
If you keep talking nonsense,

103
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,349
I'll cut your tongue out.

104
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:20,541
Master, let him continue.

105
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,100
The strong man who attacked you

106
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,312
had pale lips,

107
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:25,460
yellow teeth,

108
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:26,520
a sweaty forehead,

109
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,390
and a strong, excited nature,

110
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,626
with white and yellow
powder in his fingernails.

111
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:32,045
All these signs

112
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,890
remind me of

113
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,665
a medicine recorded in
Treatise on Cold Damage.

114
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:36,570
Five Minerals Powder.

115
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,130
The main ingredients in
Five Minerals Powder are sulphur,

116
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,390
stalactite and halloysite,

117
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,546
but they are expensive, toxic

118
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:43,408
and addictive.

119
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:44,621
So they are not very common.

120
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,442
I think

121
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,762
he's been taking it for a long time.

122
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:49,870
The culprit

123
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:52,133
knew that the strong man
was addicted to it.

124
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:55,278
So he took him to prison
and made him take it,

125
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:56,390
telling him that

126
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,992
if he killed her, he would
receive Five Minerals Powder.

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,877
Am I right?

128
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:02,936
The blindfolded

129
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:04,386
prison guard.

130
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,264
It's you.

131
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,026
Nonsense.

132
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:12,600
Your lips, teeth and nails are like his.

133
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,536
Also,

134
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,149
The discolouration of your cuffs

135
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:19,000
is probably due to prolonged
exposure to Five Mineral Powders.

136
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,429
Your purlicue is white,

137
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,821
which is probably from
the damage of sulfur to the skin.

138
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:24,482
Hey.

139
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,350
An addict like you

140
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:28,120
should still have
Five Minerals Powder on you.

141
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,984
Indeed.

143
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:43,405
This thing is addictive.

144
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,620
My pay is not enough.

145
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:49,253
Yesterday, after Zhang Xiaomeng
was put in prison,

146
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:52,352
the Sixth Prince gave me
a hundred taels of gold.

147
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:53,149
So I had to...

148
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,149
I'm sorry!

149
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:58,037
Take him away.

150
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,880
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,688
Xiaomeng.

152
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:04,940
It's already midnight.

153
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,620
The situation in
the East Palace is urgent.

154
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:07,830
My men are outside.

155
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:09,517
Get dressed and hurry to the palace.

156
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:12,226
Beauty.

157
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,074
I will see you again.

158
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:15,989
What a joker.

159
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,714
(The Sixth Prince has met you.)

160
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:28,190
(Without formalities,)

161
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:29,453
(you were not supposed to be there.)

162
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,346
(So you had to put on a disguise.)
