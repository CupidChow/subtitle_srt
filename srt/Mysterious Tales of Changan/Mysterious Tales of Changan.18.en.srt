00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,058
Li Xinghe.

2
00:00:10,434 --> 00:00:11,450
What do you want to do?

3
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,720
But I like her.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,898
If I lose it all because of her,

5
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,848
I deserve it.

6
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:40,890
Your Highness.

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,864
You've really grown up.

8
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:49,706
You don't need me anymore.

9
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,640
Empress.

10
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:00,570
What do you want to do?

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,581
Eunuch Cui.

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,290
You...

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,090
Empress, I'm coming to you.

14
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:16,698
Eunuch Cui!

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,242
=Mysterious Tales of Chang'an=

16
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,300
=Episode 18=

17
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,554
Zhang Xiaomeng,
can you give a statement?

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,377
She doesn't need to do that.

19
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:44,061
Leave.

20
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,470
Your dossier was sent to the Ministry
of Justice and Court of Judicial Review.

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,808
They found you not guilty.

22
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,117
I was innocent.

23
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,376
Where do you want to go next?

24
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,874
It's almost the anniversary
of my parents' death.

25
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:08,253
I'm going back to see my grandfather,

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,520
pay my respects to my parents

27
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,248
and then get a good night's sleep.

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,354
Hold on.

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,514
When are you coming back?

30
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,445
What for?

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,386
Hey.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,112
You heard me when I said I liked you.

33
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,752
You must come back as my wife.

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,669
You've got to be kidding me.

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm not kidding.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,480
I swear.

37
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,461
I am serious.

38
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:33,576
In the name of God.

39
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:40,000
I know. You think
the palace is dangerous.

40
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,741
But I'm not that kind of person.

41
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,216
This is the first time I've
confessed my love to someone.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,002
(Wait.)

43
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,864
(Why did Sixth Prince commit suicide?)

44
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,421
(Something must have happened.)

45
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:57,645
What's wrong?

46
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,274
What do you have in mind?

47
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:02,285
Sixth Prince

48
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,461
was trying to kill me in the backyard.

49
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,816
Why did he suddenly go to the east wing?

50
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,728
What did he see

51
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:11,000
that made him take his own life?

52
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,640
We can ask to find out.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:16,970
Hey.

54
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,514
Your Highness.

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,164
Did you notice

56
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,472
anyone lingering here before dawn?

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,373
Official Chu brought another
person to stay here for a while.

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,853
Said to be

59
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,352
a colleague who assisted in the case.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,112
You may go now.

61
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,674
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,272
My master was here.

63
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,781
Sixth Prince must have
seen the grown-up child.

64
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,261
Do you mean

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,749
Consort Lu's child?

66
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:51,440
Yes.

67
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,173
I still have some confusion.

68
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm going to prison.

69
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,928
You haven't answered whether
you want to be my wife.

70
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,866
(It seems that
Sixth Prince saw Mister Lu.)

71
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,896
(He found out he knew about the truth
of his mother's murder)

72
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,493
(and sought to punish himself
by committing suicide)

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,864
(so that Mister Lu would not
reveal the truth to the public.)

74
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,789
Master.

75
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,629
Where is he?

76
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,757
He was imprisoned for a few days

77
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,509
for a minor offence. He was released.

78
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,424
He told you to wait
here for me, didn't he?

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,298
I don't get it.

80
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,578
There was a child who didn't die

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,500
in the fox spirit case 20 years ago.

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,674
When he grew up,

83
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,000
he decided to bring
the truth about his past to light.

84
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:44,760
so

85
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,262
he approached an official
of Court of Judicial Review

86
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:50,250
to uncover the truth
through the hands of a girl

87
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,336
who had lost her father to a fox spirit.

88
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,890
He got rid of some enemies

89
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:55,621
without doing anything himself.

90
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,570
What are you talking about, Xiaomeng?

91
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,100
The female envoy was
willing to die for him.

92
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,370
Was he sent to the clan as a baby

93
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:07,760
and raised in the Wolves?

94
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:11,636
Master.

95
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,109
Are you from this empire?

96
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,712
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

97
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:18,520
It's okay.

98
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,728
What I just told you

99
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,725
is a story.

100
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:34,194
He said

101
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,976
you will see each other again.

102
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,789
(Brother.)

103
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:45,928
(Your surname is Li.)

104

00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:48,805
