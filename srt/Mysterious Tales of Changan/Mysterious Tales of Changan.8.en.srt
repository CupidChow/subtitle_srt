00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,460
This way.

2
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,112
Watch your step.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,500
Okay.

4
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:11,002
Magistrate Zhang has given you consent
to participate in the investigation.

5
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,104
Remember the way.

6
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:12,965
You will

7
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,490
share a room with my daughter,
Shen Mei these few days.

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,110
Thank you, Chief Shen.

9
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:18,104
Don't mention it.

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,780
I drank a lot of your grandfather's
wine back in the day.

11
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:22,944
Here we are.

12
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:26,576
Come on in.

13
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:30,560
Father, you are back.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,136
This is my daughter, Shen Mei.

15
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,330
This is Zhang Xiaomeng.

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,700
She's staying with us for
the time being. She'll share your room.

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,024
You are so beautiful, like a fairy.

18
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,040
Thanks.

19
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,150
Don't just stand around talking.
Come in and eat.

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,910
Yes.

21
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,700
Let's eat first.

22
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:46,000
Father, go ahead.
I'll take this for you.

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,514
You're finally being
nice to your father.

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,138
Mei is two years younger than you.

27
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,832
She's helping out at
her uncle's pharmacy.

28
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,740
Here, have some soup.

29
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:04,840
Thank you.

30
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:08,550
Miss Shen.

31
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,310
I've been having dry skin lately
and my complexion is bad.

32
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,304
Do you have any beauty
remedies in your pharmacy

33
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,220
that you can give me?

34
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,261
Boil winter melon seeds, bamboo,
yam and astragalus together

35
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:18,506
to make a beauty soup.

36
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:20,509
It is perfect for hydration this season.

37
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:22,350
Then prescribe me a set later.

38
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:23,114
No problem.

39
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,605
Miss Xiaomeng, try the soup.

40
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:26,146
My mother's soup is delicious.

41
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,696
Okay.

42
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,594
Delicious.

43
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:30,746
Mei.

44
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,713
Stop talking. Eat up.

45
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,660
Okay, then I will chat
with Miss Xiaomeng before bed.

46
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,701
Miss Shen, I'll turn off the light.

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,122
No, Miss Xiaomeng.

48
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,541
I'm afraid of the dark.

49
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:46,000
It's dangerous to keep
this candle lit overnight.

50
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:47,220
Please.

51
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,670
Fine, as you wish.

52
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,837
Miss Xiaomeng.

53
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,290
I heard from my father that you
can do autopsies. Aren't you scared?

54
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,260
What's so frightening about the dead?

55
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,020
It's the living that is horrible.

56
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,740
Are you afraid of me?

57
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:12,072
You smell amazing,

58
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,346
just like a fairy. So I'm not afraid.

59
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,236
I'm even happy to have you around.

60
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:19,780
Who did you learn
your boasting skills from?

61
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:21,397
It's a bit too much.

62
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,109
Not at all.

63
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,410
Shen Mei.

64
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:52,914
Shen Mei.

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,448
(Miss Xiaomeng.)

66
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,640
(My father asked me
to pick out a costume for you.)

67
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:04,202
(See if it fits.)

68
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,752
(Father, I finally have a job.)

69
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:21,445
It is the custom of our magistrate

70
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,640
that the farmer must be locked up
if he is not free from suspicion.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,550
Did you guys beat him up?

72
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,546
Of course.

73
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,220
It is the practice of the guards.
They will get beaten up after eating.

74
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:30,180
He hasn't been convicted yet.
Don't do that next time.

75
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,070
Official.

76
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,648
It really has nothing to do with me.

77
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,310
I've already cooperated
with the statement.

78
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,360
I've read the statement,

79
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,322
but there are some things
I need you to think over.

80
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:48,670
How can I help you?

81
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,780
My uncle has gone for delivery. Do you
want to wait or should I help you?

82
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:52,910
I have a prescription.

83
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,525
Your prescription is for wind chill.

84
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,780
You must have caught a cold
in the middle of the night.

85
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:19,664
What is it?

86
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,920
Your forehead is injured

87
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,690
Let me put some ointment on it.

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,288
Come closer.

89
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:28,460
Come on.

90
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,910
Don't move.

91
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:41,870
Don't touch it.

92
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,980
All right.

93
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,309
Mister, are you left-handed?

94
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:58,260
People say that left-handers are smart.

95
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:00,285
How do you know?

96
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,597
Because your left hand cuff is more worn

97
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,485
than your right hand cuff.

98
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,536
I'm smart, aren't I?

99
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:12,458
Official, what exactly
do you want to know?

100
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,677
Let me help you recall.

101
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,386
As you said,

102
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,234
you went out of town to deliver.

103
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:21,830
After delivery,

104
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,776
You passed by a deserted fishing village

105
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,150
and you saw the scene
of a murder, didn't you?

106
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,520
Yes, that's right.

107
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,338
Did you see anyone suspicious

108
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:33,613
or hear something suspicious?

109
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:36,685
No.

110
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,514
I passed that place

111
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,784
because it was the fastest way.

112
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,616
In fact, I passed
that road twice that day.

113
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:46,586
There was no carriage

114
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,854
for the first time.

115
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,261
Then I returned for the second time

116
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,757
and suddenly there was a carriage.

117
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,610
I didn't see anyone suspicious either.

118
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,117
You mentioned in your statement

119
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,780
that you saw the carriage,

120
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:01,821
thought it was strange,
walked over to it

121
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:03,640
and suddenly it caught fire, didn't you?

122
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:05,981
Yes.

123
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,370
That's true.

124
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,232
It caught fire all of a sudden.
Don't you think it's weird?

125
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,260
You were the only one present
when the carriage caught fire.

126
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:17,670
So you can't be ruled out
as the one who set it alight.

127
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,008
No.

128
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,310
It really wasn't me.

129
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:21,056
Official.

130
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,714
It really has nothing to do with me.

131
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,800
Did the carriage catch fire at noon?

132
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,906
Yes.

133
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,910
Noon.

134
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,456
The sun rose

135
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,693
and so did the temperature.

136
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:38,752
Hey.

137
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,677
Tell the truth,
or I'll beat you up again.

138
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,965
I still have no idea even
if you beat me to death.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,698
Meng.

140
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,266
Master.

141
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:55,870
Master.

142
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,330
I miss you so much.

143
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,296
Cut it out.

144
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,133
I know you're investigating
a serious case.

145
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,386
Criminals like to roam the crime scene.

146
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,352
He had gone to great
lengths to stage the case.

147
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,762
He definitely would like
to watch this scene.

148
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,020
I thought about it,

149
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:13,720
but no trace was found nearby.

150
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,693
I've been to the crime scene.

151
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,594
Master, let's sit down and talk.

152
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:26,821
Just a short distance away,

153
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:28,338
on an abandoned building,

154
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,550
a place

155
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,992
where you can see
the scene of the burning.

156
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,832
(It's true that the street you searched)

157
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,557
(left no trace of the killer.)

158
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,770
(That's because)

159
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,613
(he had been hiding elsewhere.)
