Master Zhu, Zhu Yuanzhen.

He has always taken good care of you.

Master Zhu?

I heard

he fell overboard during the day.

12
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:34,413
Master Zhu is a lucky man.

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,834
So he's fine.

Yes.

loved you, Miss Liu.

take good care of him down there.

Master Zhu, I beg you.

Please let me go.

72
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:10,470
I beg you, Master Zhu.

73
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,637
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

74
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:13,480

Bow to the parents.

77
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,160
Bow to each other,

78
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,800
No.

Let me go!

80
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,350
Into the bridal chamber!

81
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:38,510
Let me go!

82
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,920
After that,

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,620
Liu Ruyan

84
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,864
was perished.

85
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,350
It's been a year.

86
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,110
That is the tomb of
Liu Ruyan and Zhu Yuanzhen.

87
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,592
There has been no news since then

88
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,392
and no justice has been done.

89
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,653
A living soul

90
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:06,970
has been killed by this
ridiculous folk superstition.

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,088
Mister.

92
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,000
You're talking about
a story from a year ago.

93
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,669
Does it have any connection

94
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,390
with the present murder?

95
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,950
The one who died

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,562
was the old housekeeper from a year ago.

97
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,424
The souls of the unjust
are seeking revenge.

98
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,434
Zhang coroner is here.

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,230
Zhang, you are finally here.

100
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,952
Without you, we wouldn't dare

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,437
to touch that corpse.

102
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,818
Who is she?

103
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,760
She's my granddaughter,

104
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,270
Zhang Xiaomeng. She can help.

105
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,500
Come and see.

106
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,620
Watch your step.

107
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,440
Look.

108
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,450
Take down the body.

109
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,136
Who are they?

110
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,213
Coroner is

111
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,378
a master of crime-solving.

112
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,968
That is his granddaughter.

113
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,510
It's a bad profession to be in.

114
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,272
Twenty years ago, this girl
was only one year old

115
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,098
when her parents died.

116
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,042
I heard that

117
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,325
her father's death was
related to a fox spirit.

118
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,109
Fractured hyoid bone, purplish face.

119
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,157
He hanged himself.

120
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,760
Friction burns on ears.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,368
Twine fibres are found in fingers.

122
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,944
There has been an intense struggle.

123
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:29,600
Footprints, offerings

124
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,405
and shoes are scattered
far from each other.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Zhang.

126
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,550
I think it's a bad idea
to let your granddaughter

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,980
work in this field.

128
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,720
She is smarter than me.

129
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:39,376
Shen.

130
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,520
Bringing her to explore and learn.

131
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,832
I don't know what's on your mind.

132
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,390
He has been dead for 10 hours.

133
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,416
He committed suicide last night.

134
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,738
However, it doesn't look like suicide.

135
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,498
There was no trace of
a second person at the scene.

136
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,104
I assume

137
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,650
(he came alone.)

138
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,020
(Liu Ruyan and Zhu Yuanzhen's tomb)

139
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,300
(Liu Ruyan and Zhu Yuanzhen's tomb)

140
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,208
I'm the housekeeper of the Zhu family.

141
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,098
Do you remember me?

142
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,424
These days,

143
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,322
things are not going
well for the Zhu family.

144
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,000
Two days ago, the mistress

145
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,602
died suddenly.

146
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,709
So I thought I'd ask you.

147
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,706
Was it

148
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,000
your doing?

149
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,773
I beg you.

150
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,700
Please spare us.

151
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:49,098
Please!

152
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,830
I will worship you nicely.
