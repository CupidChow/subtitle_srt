1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,680
It's true that the street you searched
left no trace of the killer.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,013
That's because
he had been hiding elsewhere.

3
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,061
Right across the street,
in an abandoned room,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,202
I found a footprint.
Seven to eight inches long.

5
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,368
There was a dagger mark on the window.

6
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:25,218
It was probably to watch
the scene of the murder.

7
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:28,714
The killer
must have waited here for a long time.

=Episode 9=

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,450
Footprint seven to eight inches long.

11
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,810
Based on the mark
and height of the dagger,

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,542
he is estimated to be
about seven feet tall.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,340
The footprint was shallow.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,394
So he must be thin.

15
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:52,301
By the direction of the mark,
he is a left-handed man.

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,597
Master, you are amazing.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,572
I am just as well versed in
the scene trace analysis.

18
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:01,981
So now it is certain that the farmer
in the back is not the murderer.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,730
This is a serial murder case.

20
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:06,101
Yes.

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,672
Besides,

22
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:09,760
I think...

23
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,514
(Yongshun Pharmacy)
Uncle, I can deliver this medicine.

24
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:12,469
(Yongshun Pharmacy)
Take a break.

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,380
(Yongshun Pharmacy)
Take care then.

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,260
(Yongshun Pharmacy)
The time between killings is decreasing.

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,370
This means

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,440
his need for the thrill of committing
a crime is intensifying.

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,058
Chief Shen, it's thanks to you

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,761
that this street is so safe and secure.

31
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:35,504
You're really good at flattering me.

32
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,866
Chief Shen.

33
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:58,618
Come on.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,210
Coming.

35
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,504
You are a persistent and earnest lady.

36
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,000
I hope

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,522
you don't end up like your father.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,296
What's the matter, master?

39
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,053
Nothing.

40
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,512
Li Xinghe.

41
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,730
There you are.

42
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,296
Li Xinghe.

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,373
What happened?

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,672
Were they attacked?

45
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:56,613
What about Yao Zhan?

46
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:05,584
Hey.

47
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,410
Hey.

48
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,581
Get up and drink your medicine.

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,677
Yao Zhan, run!

50
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:12,176
It's okay.

51
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,224
I'm your father. I'm here.

52
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,657
Why do you have so many wrinkles

53
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,765
at such a young age?

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,192
Master.

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,690
I'm here to deliver his medicine

56
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:33,154
and take his pulse.

57
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:34,989
Do you also how to take a pulse?

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,525
I can learn.

59
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:39,621
Is he still unconscious?

60
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:40,954
Yes.

61
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,808
Did you find Yao Zhan?

62
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,872
I looked for him, but no luck.

63
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:47,824
I guess

64
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,541
we'll just have to wait
until he wakes up

65
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,746
and ask him what's going on.

66
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:53,365
Okay.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,080
So

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,792
if there's nothing else, I'll go
back to Court of Judicial Review.

69
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,464
Goodbye, master.

70
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,184
Shen Mei!

71
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,000
Shen Mei!

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,440
Is Shen Mei home?

73
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:09,706
Official Chu.

74
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:10,968
What's wrong?

75
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,690
Shen Mei's uncle said that she
never returned to the pharmacy

76
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,376
after she left to deliver
the medicine in the afternoon.

77
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,850
Her uncle went out to find her,

78
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,280
but still couldn't find her either.

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,210
Did she not come home?

80
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:20,920
No.

81
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,765
I haven't seen Shen Mei back.

82
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,709
Yes, Mei hasn't been home all day.

83
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,101
Where could she go
at this time of night?

84
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,120
Let's go out and find.

85
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,970
Shen Mei!

86
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,968
Shen Mei!

87
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,877
Mei is not taken by
the bad guys, is she?

88
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,520
Stop talking nonsense and go find her.

89
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:44,520
Shen Mei!

90
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:45,120
Hurry up.

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,093
Official Chu.

92
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,170
Did you find her?

93
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,754
I've searched over there,
but no findings.

94
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:49,706
Keep looking.

95
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:50,221
Yes.

96
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,245
No way.

97
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,410
It can't be her.

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,330
Shen Mei!

99
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,938
You know what?

100
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,474
When you were giving me the medicine,

101
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:27,111
your warmth, your eyes
and even your touch

102
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:28,784
were just like my mother's.

103
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,370
Don't worry.

104
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,357
It will be over soon.

105
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,700
All right.

106
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,890
It won't take long.

107
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,190
You make the call.

108
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,100
Tomorrow.

109
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,256
We'll do it another day.

110
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,560
You decide.

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,840
It's the medicine that Mei delivered.

112
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,304
It's the medicine that
Mei delivered. Look.

113
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,250
Yes.

114
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,456
There is blood on the stone.

115
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:47,325
Master, hit me from behind
with your left hand.

116
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,109
If the killer is left-handed,

117
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,386
then he must have a fresh wound
on the back of his left hand.

118
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,578
What do you mean?

119
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,202
It seems that Shen Mei

120
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,144
was indeed attacked.

121
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:09,410
Keep looking.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,340
Don't give up even if there is only

123
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:13,882
a glimmer of hope.
