was Zhang Xiaomeng,
the constable I had seen.

Nonsense.

How could such a lovely
person like me kill someone?

I feel sorry for him since his mother
died when he was a child.

61
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:55,426
I didn't expect him

62

to change his temperament.

I did not mention it.

Zhang Xiaomeng may be at fault,

but she will be tried

No need for you to bother.

78

Thank you, Your Highness.

79
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,757
Zhang Xiaomeng,
so you have weak legs, too.

80
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:15,573
I know who the murderer is.

81
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:16,725
Okay.

82
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,850
Put me down, or someone will see us.

83
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:27,264
So what?

84
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,544
My legs are fine now.
Please let me down.

85
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,210
You're not fine.

concerns you.

90
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,672
So you should listen carefully

91

to everything I say.

92
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,162
We are listening.

93
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:59,320
After the female envoy
had killed the man,

94
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,453
Official Chu Qi led everyone to
the east wing to search for evidence.

95
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:04,680
And by this time,

96
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,260
you have called the envoy
to the backyard.

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,000
Did Mr. Lu ask you to kill Ada

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,730
to cause war between the two countries?

99
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

100
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,024
He said this is how

101
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,000
you will be defeated.

102
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,960
Why?

103
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,770
Are you going to disobey him?

104
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,126
Don't you forget

105
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,600
what you did 20 years ago.

106
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,912
You've been holding
onto this for 20 years

107
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,056
and now you dare
to frame the Crown Prince.

108
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,050
So I can't let you get away with it.

(there were no footprints near the body.)

115
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,560
(And you didn't have to go into the snow.)

116
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:54,480
(Lastly,)

117

(That's why)

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,229
(everyone didn't notice
you were ever gone)

124
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,730
(and you were off the hook.)

125
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,640
What's the matter?

126
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:09,589
