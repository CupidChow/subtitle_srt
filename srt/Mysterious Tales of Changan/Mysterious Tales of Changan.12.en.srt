I don't understand why you're running.

Am I treating you badly?

20
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:53,517
Rest assured.

21
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,080
I'll make you different from others.

I'll make you special.

Shen Mei.

Yuwen Zhao!

Yuwen Zhao is dead.

26

How will we explain to the Sixth Prince?

27
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,632
Zhang Xiaomeng, you have
overstepped your duty

28
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:11,669
and murdered an official.

29
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,517
You'll be transferred to
Court of Judicial Review

30

for retrial by the Judicial Divisions.

that I killed Yuwen Zhao,)

the dead girl, Shen Mei.)

(This world is not fair.)

00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:34,960
I can't believe this.

She is sent to jail for doing justice.

38
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:39,434
If Meng isn't imprisoned
in Court of Judicial Review,

39
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:40,818
I'm afraid she'll be in more danger.

40
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:43,432
Your Highness.

41
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:45,218
General Wang ordered us
to take you back to the palace.

42
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:46,426
Please come with us at once.

43
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:48,261
What's so urgent?

44
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:49,986
Your Highness.

45
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:51,728
The war in the west is now raging

46
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:53,058
and the Wolves are visiting.

47
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:54,586
If they find out that His Majesty is ill

48
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:55,562
and that there's no one in the court,

49
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,140
they will invade the east.

50
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,253
If this is the case,

51
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,301
it will be detrimental to our dynasty.

52
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:01,760
Where are the envoys
of the Wolves now?

53
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,416
I asked General Wang to arrange
for them to stay in the East City,

54
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,789
where they were scheduled for
a peace talk with His Majesty tonight.

55
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:11,210
Does that mean

56
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:12,664
I'm going to take my father's place

57
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:14,362
at the banquet?

58
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,950
This is the only option.

59
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,346
(Soon, the envoys of the Wolves were
brought into the palace by General Wang.)

60
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,898
(I instructed General Wang
to inform them that)

(my father was having a cold.)

62
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:27,270
General Zan Lie.

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,474
(And that I would host
the peace talk on behalf of my father.)

64
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,597
(The venue for the banquet
was in the East Palace.)

65
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,990
(I am accompanied by)

66
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:37,064
(Mingde Palace)
(the Sixth Prince, a powerful minister,)

67

(and Eunuch Cui, a peacemaker.)

68
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,140
Your Highness.

69
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,264
Why do you look so glum?

70
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,390
To be honest with you,

71
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
my son, Yuwen Zhao,

72
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
was murdered by
a wicked woman last night.

73
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,350
She is locked in the prison
of Court of Judicial Review

74
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,220
and has not yet been brought to justice.

75
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,184
That's ridiculous.

76
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,664
She should be sentenced to death.

77
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:05,277
Just leave it to

78
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,410
Court of Judicial Review
to investigate the case.

79
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,336
Please don't be distracted.

80
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:11,470
Yes, Your Highness.

81
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,950
(At sunset, the Wolves' envoys arrived.)

82
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,020
(One of them, Ada, said
he had a painful stomach)

83
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,344
(and it was unbearable.)

84
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,989
(So I sent the guards to take him
to the east wing to rest.)

Take good care of him.

86
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,180
Yes.

87
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:26,540
This way, please.
