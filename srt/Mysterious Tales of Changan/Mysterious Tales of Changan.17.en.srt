1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,100
Everyone went from
the hall to the east wing

2
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:09,140
and stepped into the snow.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,853
Only the murderer,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,640
for the last time,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,034
did not step into it.

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,973
Everyone's soles are wet from the snow

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,704
and you are

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:21,789
the only one

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,128
with dry soles.

10
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:27,080
There is only one doubt

11
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:28,709
in all my reasoning.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,740
You have to set up the rope
to transport the body.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,189
Why did you plan the killing in advance?

=Mysterious Tales of Chang'an=

15

=Episode 17=

16
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:47,405
Yes.

17
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:50,520
I did it.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,528
General Zan Lie.

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,360
Your envoy killed your attendant

20
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,312
in an attempt to start a war
between the two countries.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,201
For someone so ill-intentioned,

22
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,720
it should be no problem for me

23
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:08,970
to kill her for you.

24
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:10,530
You also killed,

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,248
but you are still alive.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,613
Make peace?

27
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:18,749
No way!

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,216
Why did you kill her?

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,680
You even covered up
the truth with the fox spirit.

30
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,026
Why?

31
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,949
Did you also

32
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,274
have something to do
with the fox spirit case

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,378
in Consort Lu's palace 20 years ago?

34
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,013
Do you dare to listen to

35
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,256
what I have to say?

36
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:45,365
I'll listen if you dare.

37
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,570
I'd also like to know
how my father died.

38
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,264
I command you to say it.

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,344
This is a private royal matter.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,688
It's better to keep it from outsiders.

41
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,661
Your Highness, if you
really want to hear it,

42
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,064
please come with me.

43
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:16,069
Sixth Prince.

44
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:17,416
Uncle.

45
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:22,717
The deceased showed
no signs of struggle.

46
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:25,120
Based on the scene,

47
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,293
it is identified as suicide.

48
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,424
But how could he commit suicide?

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,216
You must know something.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,218
You know the envoy, don't you?

51
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:41,077
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have shunned everyone

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,200
and followed you to the backyard.

53
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:43,266
Yes.

54
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,218
You must know her.

55
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,378
Speak!

56
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:47,384
Your Highness.

57
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,090
Looks like

58
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,082
I can't hide it anymore.

59
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:54,593
A year ago,

60
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:58,000
A mysterious man sent me a letter

61
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,464
detailing the truth about
the fox spirit murder case

62
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,786
at Concubine Lu's palace.

63
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:05,416
I was terrified

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,853
as to how anyone in the world could know

65
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:12,456
the truth about the case
other than me and the Sixth Prince.

66
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,786
I followed Sixth Prince to
meet the mysterious man.

67
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,000
It turned out

68
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,858
it was the female envoy.

69
00:03:23,298 --> 00:03:24,269
She said

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,005
she was working for a young man.

71
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:28,261
Your Highness.

72
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:30,866
You must be aware of this person.

73
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,117
I've investigated that case before.

74
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,218
If I'm not mistaken,

75
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,474
you were also responsible

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,782
for the fox spirit case 20 years ago,

77
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:41,402
weren't you?

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,178
Let me think about your motive.

79
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:49,504
That year...

80
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,608
(Harmony Pavilion)
(At that time,)

81
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,234
(Harmony Pavilion)
(Consort Lu was favoured by the emperor)

82
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:57,256
(and gave birth to a son.)

83
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,498
Consort Lu, look.

84
00:03:58,792 --> 00:03:59,818
It's a prince.

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,830
He's so cute.

86
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:02,389
Xiaolu.

87
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,296
Put the child in the basket over there

88
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,834
and take him out of the palace first.

89
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:08,120
I dare not do that.

90
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,909
I have been favoured by
the emperor for many years

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,976
and I am being watched by the empress.

92
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,117
I'm afraid she will
lay hands on my child.

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,000
Take him out of the palace first.

94
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,832
Consort Lu.

95
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,570
Don't be anxious.
Your health is important.

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,149
Physician Zhang.

97
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,990
You should leave, too.

98
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,280
I won't.

99
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,786
(At that time, Li Xinghe
was only two years old.)

100
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,792
(The empress requested
Sixth Prince and Eunuch Cui)

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,120
(to do a great task to
protect her child's position)

102
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,090
(as Crown Prince.)

103
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,584
(You killed everyone in the room)

104
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:52,808
(as if they had been killed by
animals, just like the female envoy.)

105
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,424
(Harmony Pavilion)
(So)

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,368
(Harmony Pavilion)
(you called it a fox spirit.)

107
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,617
It just didn't occur to you

108
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,000
that the child wasn't dead.

109
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,853
The story then reached the people,

110
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:08,661
and by extension,

111
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:10,888
you said that the fox spirit
had taken the child.

112
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:14,910
You...

113
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,386
How could you?

114
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,520
Back then,

115
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,101
my father, Imperial Physician Zhang,
was also present.

116
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:27,072
What did he do wrong?

117
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,797
So you are his daughter.

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,008
No wonder.

119
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:38,448
He did nothing wrong.

120
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,525
His mistake was that

121
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:42,341
he lived in the palace.

122
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:47,624
So the mystery man the envoy said

123
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,474
was the child, right?

124
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:54,178
Xiaomeng.

125
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:57,040
Don't touch me!

126
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,418
How many lives do you want to take

127
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,965
for your throne?

128
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,080
I...

129
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:04,046
Your Highness.

130
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:06,306
You asked why I set up that trap.

131
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:08,452
It was because

132
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,224
I wanted to kill Sixth Prince.

133
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,818
I never thought

134
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,540
she would find out
the secret bit by bit.

135
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:18,376
Your Highness.

136
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:23,176
Now there are two more
of you who know the secret.

137
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:25,168
Kill her.

138
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:28,133
Your Highness.

139
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:48,040
Li Xinghe.

140
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,682
What do you want to do?
