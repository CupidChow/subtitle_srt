00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,710
(My parents weren't
in a good relationship.)

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,338
(They were always arguing.)

00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:14,525

(with depression.)

00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,005
(After that,)

00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:25,661
(I never saw my mother again.)

8
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:29,365
I heard she was

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,754
burnt to ashes in a fire.

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,640
It must have been very warm.

11
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:37,786
So they

12
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:40,984
should be warm, too.

=Episode 11=

15
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:01,034
Yuwen Zhao.

16
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,514
Tell us where Shen Mei is.

17
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:05,789
Where is the girl you captured?

18
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:09,270
I don't know.

19
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,657
Mister Yuwen.

20
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,642
Did you kill them?

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,346
Seven deaths in a serial arson case.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,150
Same murder method.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,270
Tell me.

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,506
Did you do it?

25
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,021
Do you have the evidence?

26
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,000
I guess

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,461
I suppose you mixed white phosphorus,
sulphur and wood chips together

28
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:34,965
then scattered them in the carriage.

29
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:38,190
And when the sun came up at noon
and the temperature rose,

30
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,962
it would suddenly
caught fire, didn't it?

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,120
You like that kind of ritual,

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,960
don't you?

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,037
It's come to this

34
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:49,750
and you still won't admit it?

35
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:52,310
I won't.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,165
Where is my daughter?

37
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:56,000
Where is Shen Mei?

38
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,754
Speak! Where is Shen Mei?

39
00:01:58,765 --> 00:01:59,693
Yuwen Zhao.

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,482
Tell me!

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,866
After your mother died,

42
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,392
you haven't had any contact
with women, have you?

43
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,040
Your heart turned cold

44
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:10,520
after your mother's death.

45
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,989
You escape into your own world.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,750
You reject the opposite sex.

47
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,045
For so long,

48
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:18,061
you resent your mother
for abandoning you,

49
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,080
you resent yourself for
not being able to move on

50
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,386
and you even resent the opposite sex.

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
So you put yourself
in a different identity

52
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,445
to fulfill your fantasy trial,

53
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,136
your fantasy of being
with the opposite sex.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,392
I'll kill you.

55
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,584
Let me ask you a question.

56
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:36,784
Are you

57
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,648
impotent?

58
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,106
I'll kill you!

59
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,277
My lord, Sixth Prince is here.

60
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,350
What?

61
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:01,701
Magistrate Zhang.

62
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,586
Your Highness, I didn't
know you were coming.

63
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:05,830
Sorry for overlooking it.

64
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:06,914
My fellow official.

65
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,120
My son has given you trouble.

66
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:10,776
I wonder what he has done.

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,960
Is the evidence

68
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,152
solid?

69
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,870
To be honest,

70
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,190
It's...

71
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,080
It's a serial murder case

72
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,349
with seven deaths in total.

73
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,520
He's being interrogated.

74
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,312
I'm asking you

75
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:27,117
if the evidence is solid.

76
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:28,710
Not yet.

77
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:30,320
Release him.

78
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,384
No.

79
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,376
If you have proof,

80
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,165
come to my residence.

81
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:53,917
If not...

82
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:57,770
I will mark you.

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Where can we find Shen Mei?

84
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,874
When we caught Yuwen Zhao last night,

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,790
he was dressed as a commoner,

86
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,568
presumably to hide his identity.

87
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,298
He had fresh mud on his feet

88
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:16,589
and green coloured
smears on his clothes.

89
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,040
Bamboo forest.

90
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,986
Search the bamboo
forest outside the city.

91
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,501
That makes sense.

92
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:24,080
Let's go.

93
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,973
Stay at home for two days.

94
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:35,992
I have something to do.

95
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,965
Are you going to cause me more trouble?

96
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,938
I just

97
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,608
want to visit mother's grave.

98
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:48,234
Today is

99
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,837
the anniversary of her death.

100
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,670
Official Chu.

101
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,986
Where are you taking me out of town?

102
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,736
I want you to take me to a risky place

103
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:09,150
to see if there are any clues.

104
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,418
I also want to know if
Yao is still alive or dead.

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
After all, he has been
with me for five years.

106
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,400
Let's look around.

107
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:16,480
All right.

108
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,870
Speak. Who sent you here?

109
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,310
He took poison.

110
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:20,960
It's not safe here. Let's go.

111
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:24,898
Looks like

112
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,357
these guys were all deadbeats.

113
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,346
Your Highness, let me take
you back to the palace.

114
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:31,936
How do you know I'm the Crown Prince?

115
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,480
I knew it from the first time

116
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,018
I saw you with your badge.

117
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,909
However,

118
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:42,933
if I go back to the palace...

119
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,230
Your Highness, are you
worried about Zhang Xiaomeng?

120
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,509
You don't know

121
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,013
that Yuwen Zhao is
the son of the Sixth Prince.

122
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,930
I'm worried that she
won't be able to handle it.

123
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,016
I'll return to the palace

124
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:02,706
when the case is solved.
