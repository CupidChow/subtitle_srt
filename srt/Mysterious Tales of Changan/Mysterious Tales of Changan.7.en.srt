1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,776
How exactly does this poison
spread into the body?

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,217
The poisonous centipede
he brought back from the south

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,154
carries a large amount
of poisonous powder

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,020
that can be transmitted through the air,

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:11,370
causing people to hallucinate,

6
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:12,501
become confused

7
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,312
and be manipulated or killed by him.

8
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,600
Madam Su has gone mad.

9
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:20,465
The physician said

10
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:22,194
she doesn't have many days left.

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,260
What goes around comes around.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,816
I just hope

13
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:29,602
that Ruyan can rest in peace.

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:32,693
Well,

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,330
it's a dangerous world.

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,546
Are you going to brag and say

17
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:38,685
you're going back to the palace?

18
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:43,000
Does he really think he's a commoner?

19
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,266
Won't he return to the palace?

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,608
=Mysterious Tales of Chang'an=

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,712

22
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:04,994
Who's there?

23
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,309
Anyone there?

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,973
Why did it catch fire all of a sudden?

25
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:31,989
Let's check over there.

26
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:35,962
Are you sure you were alone

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,610
when the carriage caught fire?

28
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,578
Yes.

29
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,818
Think about it again.

30
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,010
Is there anything you've missed?

31
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,780
Any findings?

32
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:45,940
Not at the moment.

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,740
Keep looking.

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,220
All right.

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,632
Is Zhang Xiaomeng here?

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,500
There she is.

37
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:54,330
You're here.

38
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,421
Chief Shen.

39
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,560
Are you here this time

40
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:08,677
to take over from your grandfather?

41
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:11,290
I told my grandfather
I wanted to find a proper job.

42
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:20,006
You are very talented,

43
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:23,080
but we've never had
a female constable in the magistracy.

44
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,565
Have you found a place to live?

45
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,381
Let's go.

46
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:37,500
I've worked with your
grandfather for many years.

47
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:38,760
You can stay at my house

48
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,202
and keep my daughter company.

49
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:43,368
I will speak to the magistrate

50
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,780
about the job.

51
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,260
I've taken a look at the body.

52
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,850
She was wearing a bracelet.

53
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:54,573
So it was not for money.

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,420
Check again.

55
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,368
It's a female corpse.

56
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,757
Her hands were tied from behind.

57
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:09,048
No trace of struggle.

58
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:10,637
She was probably

59
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,280
unconscious before the fire.

60
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,522
However, the body was too badly damaged

61
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,181
for me to determine
the exact time of her death.

62
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,050
Whether she was

63
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,434
unconscious or dead

64
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:23,960
before the fire

65
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,730
depended on the ashes
remaining in her lungs.

66
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:30,850
This elaborate,
ritualistic killing method

67
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,349
was never expected to happen again.

68
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,082
Again?

69
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:36,740
Yes.

70
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,082
Just a few months ago,

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,578
A mother in red

72
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,658
went to a relative's house in town

73
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,354
to borrow a basket of rice.

74
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,933
(By the time we got there,)

75
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:05,552
(she was burnt to the ground as well.)

76
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,021
(It stank as badly)

77
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:08,314
(as it does now.)

78
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:11,074
(The air was thick with burning ashes.)

79
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:15,320
(her children were waiting for her
to come home and make dinner.)

80
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,040
This is not the first time.

81
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,285
In the previous five years,

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,050
there were six other cases
with exactly the same method.

83
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:26,274
Each time we had all hands on deck,

84
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,340
but we came up

85
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,349
empty.

86
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,434
The victim in each case was female,

87
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:34,837
all dressed in red

88
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:37,805
and burnt to ashes

89
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:39,272
early one morning.

90
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,552
It's not a revenge murder.

91
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:42,784
There's no connection

92
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,530
and the timing is irregular.

93
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,680
The first and second cases

94
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:50,336
were two years apart.

95
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:52,860
Then it was gradually shortened.

96
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,340
It's only been less than six months

97
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,530
between the last one and this one.

98
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:04,594
The killer, as if to satisfy
his own emotional needs

99
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,740
or beliefs,

100
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,386
created a kind of

101
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:11,000
fantasy trial

102
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,180
or law enforcement.

103
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,877
(Sin never ceases in the world.)

104
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,562
(Only the law is the best existence.)

105
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,549
(It ensures the bottom line of society)

106
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,224
(and the bottom line of people.)

107
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:43,928
Isn't this disrespectful to the dead?

108
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,120
Shut up.

109
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,425
This is for solving the case.

110
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:50,362
Not solving the case would be
the greatest disrespect to the dead.

111
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:16,458
The victims were not
killed and relocated,

112
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,130
but burnt alive.

113
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,586
There was a large amount of charcoal
ash in the lung section of the deceased

114
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,946
and there was no struggle before death.

115
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,050
I assume

116
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,260
she may have been
drugged before she died.

117
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:39,000
Councillor Liu.

118
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,232
You said that you received
a bloodstained letter

119
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,640
at your home the night before last.

120
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:46,538
The letter reads that
he has a blood feud with you

121
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,512
and asks you to bring
200 taels in an envelope

122
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,940
and send it to No. 37 Wuliu Street.

123
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,020
Is it correct?

124
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,211
Your Excellency.

125
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:56,738
What I said is true.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,058
so yesterday morning

127
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,370
So you took out 200 tales
early yesterday morning

128
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:02,130
and had it delivered to
that address by a mailman.

129
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,126
Yes, it's packed with money.

130
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,800
Then you reported it to the authorities.

131
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,218
When my men arrived at the address,

132
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,260
they found it deserted.

133
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:14,565
The person at the recipient's
address was a former butcher

134
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,000
and has been away for many years.

135
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:18,300
Councillor Liu.

136
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,341
Are you deceiving me?

137
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:21,712
Your Excellency.

138
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,282
What I said is true.

139
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,130
Why are you here?

140
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:28,488
Your mission.

141
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,000
Chuchu.

142
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,530
Let me see you crack this case.

143
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:38,554
Zhang.

144
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:39,896
Who called me Zhang again?

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,424
Official Chu.

146
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,530
Don't you notice it?

147
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,829
The disappeared butcher
was the recipient

148
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:50,050
of the letter with
the pig's blood on it.

149
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:51,522
It's all an obscure trick.

150
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,000
The root of the case was that

151
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,264
the culprit wanted
the money in the envelope.

152
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:59,050
And there is a fixed post

153
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:02,840
and mailman in every part of the city.

154
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,589
Mail is sent and received

155
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:07,434
by a regular person.

156
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:10,140
He is the only one with
access to this money.

157
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,850
So the mailman

158
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:12,768
is the culprit.

159
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:15,837
I see.

160
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,050
What are you waiting for? Arrest him!

161
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:20,570
Yes.
