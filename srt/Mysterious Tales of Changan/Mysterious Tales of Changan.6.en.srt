What am I thinking?

00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:36,565
How could the killer be
at the bottom of the well?

11
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,194
But the centipede likes humidity

12
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:43,341
and resides at the bottom of the well.

the most unlikely places.)

Everyone, stay alert.
Don't get poisoned.

This is the antidote.

17

Give it to the people
who have been poisoned.

Let's go.

Looks like I've found the right place.

If I'm not mistaken,

Are you Liu Ruyan's younger brother?

Liu Fei?

Wait.

Did I say something wrong?

Do you have to do this?

29
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,429
I'll treat you to a meal some day.

30
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,900
You were also responsible
for the death of Liu Ruyan.

31
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:30,000
No one was willing to help her.

32
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,098
It was your indifference
that killed her!

33
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,056
But it was your family who
sent her to the brothel.

34
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,421
She never had a choice in life.

35
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:42,957
You guys took it away from her.

36
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,914
That year, my mother was seriously ill

37
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,584
and we were starving to death.

38
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,181
My father had no choice but to do so.

39
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,240
But why didn't you go back to her?

40
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,920
Did you also despise her?

41
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,093
Nonsense!

42
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,397
Eventually, my mother died
of illness in the south

43
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,496
and I came back.

44
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,420
Boss, give me a bowl of noodles

45
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,100
without coriander.

46
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,330
Boss, two bowls of
noodles without coriander.

47
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,378
Coriander is delicious.

48
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,540
My brother didn't like coriander
since he was a child.

49
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,736
Then I started not eating it.

50
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,437
I get used to it as I grow up.

51
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,020
He's a picky eater.
He doesn't eat many things.

52
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,820
You know nothing.
How could you blame me?

53
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:53,420
You went to Ruyan's grave
after her death, didn't you?

54
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,570
I went the day after the accident. So?

55
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:11,384
Why didn't you think of

56
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:12,968
digging up Ruyan

57
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,256
and reburying her
so she could rest in peace?

58
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,877
She was dead by that time.

59
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:21,540
She wasn't.

60
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,826
She lay alive in the coffin
for two days.

61
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,610
Maybe she heard everything you said

62
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,300
outside the coffin.

63
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,709
You didn't have the courage to face her.

64
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:34,330
That's why you didn't save her.

65
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:38,060
You're lying!

66
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,860
Ruyan was just a woman.

67
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,780
In this world dominated by men,

68
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,656
there were many times
you failed to save her.

69
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,100
The villains who hurt
Ruyan are all dead,

70
00:07:57,152 --> 00:08:00,160
yet you still want to hurt those
who are as innocent as her.

71
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
This is not Ruyan's wrath,

72
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,176
but your frustration at
your own incompetence.

73
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:09,290
End it now.

74
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,040
Fei.

75
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,400
Was my sister really alive

76
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,269
when she was in the coffin?

77
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:21,880
The coffin

78
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,660
is covered with bloody handprints.
