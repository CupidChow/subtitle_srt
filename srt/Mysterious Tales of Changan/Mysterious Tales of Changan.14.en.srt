1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,541
Mister, are you in the wrong cell?

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,045
Calm down.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,200
Don't come near.

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,469
There are so many people around.

5
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,040
Please calm down.

6
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:15,984
Calm down!

7
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:21,893
How can you be so rude

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,376
to a beautiful lady?

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,130
Miss.

10
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:38,637
Are you all right?

11
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,050
Miss.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,000
Looks like you've offended
someone powerful.

13
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:45,786
Thank you, Yao.

14
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:47,837
I mean Mister Bai.

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,000
Get up.

16
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:57,120
Come here.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,270
Official Chu.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,418
What happened?

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,149
=Mysterious Tales of Chang'an=

20
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:16,120
=Episode 14=

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,525
You are all court officials.

22
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,661
I would like to ask you.

23
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,528
A visiting envoy died
in the East Palace.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,350
Does the Emperor

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,114
ever care?

26
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:33,310
Gosh.

27
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,310
Didn't we tell you?

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,093
His Majesty has a cold

29
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,250
and is unfit to receive guests.

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,560
We are here on behalf of him.

31
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:40,910
Isn't it the same?

32
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:44,830
Eunuch Cui.

33
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,040
You are the Emperor's best man.

34
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:50,120
What do you think about

35
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:53,933
the Crown Prince and I going
to the Wolves Clan for a bit of fun?

36
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:55,816
Fine.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,224
I promise you

38
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,957
that if I can't give you
a reasonable explanation,

39
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:05,160
I'll go with you.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,680
He dared to do it in prison.

41
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,160
Could it be that the Sixth
Prince bought him off?

42
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,230
It's my bad luck to have offended

43
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:15,733
such a powerful man.

44
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:18,088
Master.

45
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,680
Is he really not Escort Yao?

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,640
Yes.

47
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,480
I checked all his records.

48
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,520
His name is Bai Yu, a phyisican.

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,640
That's too much of a resemblance.

50
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,910
Do you think they are really twins?

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,277
Stop looking.

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,000
Let me tell you about the case.

53
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,830
That's roughly it.

54
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,181
(These sticks)

55
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,660
(were supposedly used to support the box.)

56
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,280
(The killer chose to use
sticks to support the box)

57
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,904
(and the autopsy showed that
you were crushed to death,)

58
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:29,389
(so you would have been unconscious)

59
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:31,200
(when the killer set up the scene.)

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,597
(This is a closed chamber.)

61
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:43,496
(so how did the killer)

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,205
(get the box to fall down)

63
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,941
(without anyone here?)

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,072
(Water on the ground.)

65
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:53,802
(Sweet smell.)

66
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:58,290
(Wooden sticks. Cut table legs.)

67
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,120
(I see.)

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,390
(This is how the killer
set up the timed killing.)

69
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,184
(All it took was a block of sugar,)

70
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,776
(which slowly melted in the water.)

71
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,600
(The four sticks lost their balance)

72
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:13,877
(and the box fell over.)

73
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,533
This is how the killer did it.

74
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:17,440
So

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,848
how did he commit the murder,
get into the room

76
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,270
and set it up like this?

77
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,253
The case is too complicated.

78
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,338
In order to solve it quickly,

79
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,096
we'll have to let the murderer speak.

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,562
Let the murderer speak?

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,790
Have you figured out a way?

82
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,818
(If I'm not mistaken,)

83
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:37,390
(there's not much time
left to solve the case.)

84
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,080
Out of the way!

85
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,805
Greetings, Your Highness
and Sixth Prince.

86
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:47,640
Your Highness.

87
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,816
She is just an official of
Court of Judicial Review.

88
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:51,922
I think

89
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,464
we should ask the Chancellor
to investigate it.

90
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:57,430
I chose her

91
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:58,950
for my own reasons.

92
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:01,293
Go on.

93
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,370
I would like to see

94
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,720
the coat of whoever left
during the banquet

95
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,080
so that

96
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:11,632
I can quickly find out
who killed the envoy.

97
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:14,813
Ridiculous.

98
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:17,325
Nonsense.

99
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,790
I believe her.

100
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,640
All right.

101
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,698
I would also like to see

102
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,528
what this Central Plains native can do.

103
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:35,486
(Among those who left the hall
were General Zan Lie,)

104
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,178
(the Sixth Prince)

105
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,752
(and the Wolves' female envoy.)

106
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:45,560
So

107
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:47,528
I'll put your three coats together

108
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,845
and use this.

109
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,720
What are you trying to do?

110
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,578
The ants

111
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,613
will tell us who the real culprit is.

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,562
The ants came out.

113
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:14,200
Why are they all climbing on
the coat of the female envoy?

114
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,160
You're right.

115
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,056
This is weird.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,402
So are you saying that

117
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,901
the murderer of Ada

118
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:26,080
was a female envoy
brought by General Zan Lie?

119
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,701
Ridiculous!

120
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,632
This is child's play!

121
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,714
How is this possible?

122
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,390
General.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,517
Where's the female envoy next to you?

124
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,950
She went to the loo. Didn't you see?

125
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,045
While there's still time,

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,037
I'll show you the east wing.

127
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:48,037
All right.
