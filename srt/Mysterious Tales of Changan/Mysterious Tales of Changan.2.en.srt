3
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:23,520
Yes, he must have died of fear.

4
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,944
Died of fear?

5
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,253
What kind of fear?

6
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,496
I don't know either.

7
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,005
It's just a feeling.

8
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,994
Based on his dilated pupils,
frightened face

9
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,141
and bruised skin,

10
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:43,528
he must have been experiencing
unbearable fear prior to his death.

11
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,440
Are you talking about the unjust souls?

12
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,573
There are no such things as

13
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,318
vengeful ghosts in this world.

14
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,300
You little brat.

15
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:54,909
You've read too many novels.

16
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,205
Who on earth are you?

17
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:57,860
Are you trying to spoil the scene?

18
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:58,420
Me?

19
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:00,298
You must be the murderer.

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:00,928
Murderer?

21
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:01,580
I warn you. Back off.

22
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,282
Back off!

23
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,180
Please get out of the way.

24
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:07,322
Don't drag me. This is a warning.

25
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:10,202
Listen. You are on my radar now.

26
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,576
I can walk myself.

27
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,226
Li Youquan was the head
housekeeper of the Zhu family.

28
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,421
I need to find
the master of the Zhu family,

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,620
Zhu Dafu.

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,620
Zhang, you're quite assured of her.

31
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:34,829
Not all women have to
marry and have children.

32
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:37,530
She may have a talent for the job.

33
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,034
Zhang.

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,448
Are you trying to

35
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,941
get her to look into her father's case?

36
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,914
She gets to choose her own path.

37
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,997
It is said that the Zhu family
has been haunted for the past month.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,853
The other day,

39
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,480
(Zhu Mansion)
Zhu Dafu's wife, Song,

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,277
(Zhu Mansion)
jumped into a well due to the torture.

41
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,520
Then many of the servants
fled one by one.

42
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,570
I'm afraid that the Zhu family
will be in dire straits

43
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:01,053
after the accident that happened
to the head housekeeper today.

44
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,713
Zhu Dafu is still enjoying himself
at Zuihua House at this moment.

45
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:05,786
He has a strong mind.

46
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,168
What's wrong, Meng?

47
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:11,770
Do you have something in mind?

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,213
It occurred to me

49
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,784
that I hadn't eaten yet.

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,858
Grandpa said you will
take care of the food.

51
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,270
Why are you not doing your job?

52
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,800
Lives are at stake. Let's go.

53
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:22,580
We'll take you to
a nice meal later. Come on.

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,340
Young master.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,517
You are a prince with high status.

56
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:32,520
Why do you need to
meddle in this matter?

57
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,820
Let's not go there, shall we?

58
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:34,770
You don't know

59
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:37,060
that something is bound
to happen in this brothel.

60
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,000
Then why do you still insist to go?

61
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,546
No, I won't let you go.

62
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,713
Let go.

63
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,957
You're not as effective

64
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:46,690
as the constables in there.

65
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,090
How about this?

66
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:53,488
If you really want to help me,

67
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,384
take my badge to the magistrate

68
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,480
and get some help.

69
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:00,573
Don't be dazed. Go ahead.

70
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:06,250
(Wine and Music)

71
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:12,692
Master Zhu.

72
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,573
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

73
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,780
Here. Let me pour you wine.

74
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,530
All right. Enjoy.

75
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:26,405
Hua, serve Mr. Liu well.

76
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,000
I heard that

77
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,118
the Zhu family has been
haunted recently.

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you think

79
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:36,637
she might be after us?

80
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,781
If she dares to come, we'll go to
Beishan Temple and find some monks

81
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,300
to banish her spirit for eternity.

82
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,010
Enough.

83
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,938
Goodness.

84
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,242
What brings you here, official?

85
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,453
Why do you bring a lady with you?

86
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,180
We're investigating a case.
Don't interfere.

87
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,605
That is Zhu Dafu.

88
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,741
I'll question him.

89
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,362
Something seems wrong.

90
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,722
That smell again.

91
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,416
Master Zhu, what's wrong with you?

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,849
It's itchy.

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,973
Master Zhu.

94
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,100
Madam.

95
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,100
Madam.

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,968
Help!

97
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:35,781
Help! Madam!

98
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,460
Madam.

99
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:46,759
Master Zhu.

100
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:54,821
Master Zhu.

101
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:57,176
Master Zhu.

102
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:08,719
Madam.

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,069
How are you?

104
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,039
It's been a while

105
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,064
I miss you so much.

106
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,159
Are you

107
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:19,107
Liu...

108
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:20,627
Liu Ru...

109
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:22,981
Liu Ruyan?

110
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,312
Ghosts don't exist.

111
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,239
Who are you?

112
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,709
Why play tricks?

113
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:30,963
You,

114
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,067
you,

115
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:34,859
you,

116
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,659
and all of you.

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,989
You are the ones who killed me.

118
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,675
I remember everyone

119
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,285
at Zuihua House.

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,152
I will take one of you every day

121
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,824
until you are all dead.

122
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,571
None of you can escape.

123
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:06,851
You still have time

124
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,328
to repent.

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,195
Master Zhu, what's wrong with you?

126
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:24,679
My lord, help me. Save me!

127
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,019
This is a serious matter.

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,942
Come with us to the magistrate's
office to assist in the investigation.

129
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,010
Take them all.

130
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,280
What about the two of them?

131
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,520
We need to avoid suspicion.

132
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,220
Take everyone back.

133
00:07:59,540 --> 00:07:59,860
Let's go.

134
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,260
Do you know who I am?

135
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,500
I'm one of your own.

136
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,140
You rest here tonight.

137
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,260
When the interrogation is over tomorrow
and you are cleared of suspicion,

138
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,980
you'll be released.

139
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,998
Don't push me.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,010
I thought you guys were
providing food. Liars.

141
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,220
I'll go in myself.

142
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,940
Hey, do you know who
you're imprisoning?

143
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,620
I will have you all beheaded!

144
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,320
Goodness.

145
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,960
How daring.

146
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,940
Who are you?

147
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,460
Since you are asking,

148
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,126
I might as well tell you.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,740
I am the Crown Prince,

150
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,560
Li Xinghe!

151
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,180
I see. So you're such a braggart.

152
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,640
Would you believe me if I say
I'm the empress dowager?

153
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,520
Kneel upon me.

154
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,920
You've gone too far.

155
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll give you one last chance

156
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,490
to take back what you just said.
Do you hear me?

157
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,200
Whatever.
