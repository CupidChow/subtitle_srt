1
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,352
I haven't seen you for years.
How long are you going to disappear?

2
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,272
Not for long.

3
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,168
Why do you want to see me?

4
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,970
It's interesting that a bizarre murder
happened here during the day.

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,060
Is it the murder that is interesting

6
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,660
or the people involved in the case?

7
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,460
One is a simple-minded Crown Prince

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,378
and the other is the granddaughter
of a coroner with an unsolved case.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,850
Isn't this more interesting
than a novel?

10
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:46,938
Go ahead, tell me what to do.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,880
I want you to go

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,340
and help this amusing prince.

16
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,000
Did you hear that?

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,632
Someone is beating the drum.

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,130
It must be Yao Zhan.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,656
He finally found his way here.

20
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,088
You are

21
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,296
Meng, right?

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,733
Listen.

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,885
The magistrate himself will
be here later to pick me up.

24
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,941
Stay in

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,300
this cell by yourself.

26
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:34,090
Shut up.

27
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:38,706
This prison is under
the authority of the government.

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,237
It is considered
a protection for all of us

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,840
to be cleared of any suspicion here.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,861
What suspicion are you talking about?

31
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't get it.

32
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:54,021
If what Zhu Dafu said
before he died is true

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,802
and that this incident
was just the beginning,

34
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,000
then there will be new murders soon.

35
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,840
This bug has a distinctive smell.

36
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:10,730
I remember.

37
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:12,184
I smelled it in Zuihua House

38
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,660
and the place where Li Youquan
and Zhu Dafu died.

39
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,250
Young master.

40
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:19,058
Move.

41
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,706
Yao Zhan, I knew it was you.

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,122
What took you so long to get here?

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,168
Young master.

44
00:02:32,197 --> 00:02:34,536
I told you to get help,
but no one showed up.

45
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:36,298
I'm lost.

46
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,180
Didn't you show
the county magistrate my badge?

47
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,248
Forget about that. The county
magistrate didn't recognise the badge.

48
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,420
(Looks like they are two idiots.)

49
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:45,660
Impossible.

50
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:48,216
Miss, those two people looked strange.

51
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:51,978
They are from the theatre.
Go home now.

52
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,970
What centipede? What fear?

53
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,566
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,277
Everyone at the crime scene
has been arrested by me.

55
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,074
I am now giving you a chance

56
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:11,557
to explain yourselves.

57
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,669
If you don't want to seize it,

58
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:16,000
then I'll start to torture you.

59
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,224
It's going to be painful.

60
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,538
Anyone there?

61
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,381
The door is open.

62
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,640
I'll leave then.

63
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,380
Hello.

64
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,157
You two are so tall.

65
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:03,600
Take your pick of this place.

66
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,209
I stay in a single room.

67
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,700
I'll go back first.

69
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:20,349

Do it.

70
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:21,226
Wait.

71
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,580
Leave this to me.

72
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,957
You are

73
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,000
Zhang, right?

74
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,024
There's something I'd like you
to take a closer look at.

75
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,285
He called me Zhang.

76
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,500
Does this count as contempt of court?

77
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:39,140
Come over.

78
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:40,776
Come on.

79
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,900
Perhaps you didn't see
it clearly last night.

80
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,706
I'll show you again.

81
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:51,573
Are you trying to bribe me?

82
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,770
Are you bribing or
showing off your wealth?

83
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:55,517
Zhang.

84
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:00,420
She also called me Zhang.

85
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:01,746
I can't take this anymore.

86
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,834
I'm Official Chu Qi from
Court of Judicial Review.

87
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,728
Official Chu.

88
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:09,389
I'm at your disposal.

89
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,002
I'm here to assist with the case.

90
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:15,920
First, Zhu Dafu's housekeeper,
Li Youquan, hanged himself in the forest

91
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,420
and then Zhu Dafu mysteriously
died in Zuihua House,

92
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,820
all of which I know.

93
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:23,509
Both murders

94
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:26,820
seem to be related to the disappearance
of Liu Ruyan six months ago.

95
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:27,741
I think

96
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,421
we need to find those two at
the Zuihua House immediately.

97
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,152
Perhaps

98
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,058
the killer's next target is them.

99
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,901
Sir, bad news.

100
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,580
Bad news.

101
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,309
I guess

102
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:45,226
there's an accident.

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,970
The ghost is coming to seek revenge.

104
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,098
He was dead when we found him,

105
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,850
as if he had fallen into a deep sleep.

106
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:57,490
Is everyone else locked up?

107
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,597
Yes, the lock has never been opened.

108
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,029
No fatal injuries

109
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,626
purplish skin.

110
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,928
It was as if he was
scared out of his wits

111
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,562
and died of fear

112
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,020
like Li Youquan.

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,429
And I can smell the same thing.

114
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,650
It seems that there is no criminal
among the people brought in last night.

115
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,509
Release them all.

116
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,970
Release to capture the big fish.

117
