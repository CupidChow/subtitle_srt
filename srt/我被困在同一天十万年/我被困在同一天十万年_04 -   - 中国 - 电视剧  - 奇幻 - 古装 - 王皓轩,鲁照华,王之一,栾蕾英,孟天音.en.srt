1
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,879
If you force a breakthrough,

2
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,959
your meridians will reverse, and that's hard to cure.

3
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,719
Are you trying to take advantage of my weakness?

4
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,799
I know you set up

5
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,799
a restriction array at the Supreme Clear Pool.

6
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,799
Since you know,

7
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
you still dare to come in?

8
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,480
To show my sincerity.

9
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,359
Only this way

10
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,920
will you lower your guard.

11
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me help you break through.

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,599
Sect Leader Qin's Great Dream Art of the Abyss

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,359
reaches the ninth stage, but pure yin cannot exist alone.

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,000
This causes your cultivation to reverse.

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,079
I'll use pure yang spiritual intent

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,799
to help you cultivate the three essences simultaneously.

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Only then can you break through.

18
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,560
It's done.

19
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,640
You've broken through.

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,599
It's nothing.

21
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,480
Just the Spirit Realm.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,439
Still far from enough.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,479
What is your real goal?

24
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,599
I know you may have many doubts about me.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,199
But you should understand

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,919
I'm helping you.

27
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,919
Why are you helping me?

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
Is it really as the rumors say?

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,680
Are you only doing this for the Little Saintess?

30
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,520
That's right.

31
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,240
It is indeed for Qin Yiyi.

32
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,800
But

33
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,560
I also plan to take down the Seven Tribulations Demon Emperor.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,919
Even if you're joking,

35
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,719
that's not something you can say lightly on the Hongmeng Continent.

36
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,520
You can't just say that.

37
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,599
Do you really mean it?

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,960
Of course.

39
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,039
You're crazy.

40
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,199
Tomorrow night,

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
I'll show you a good show.

42
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,159
Crimson Dawn Pavilion sent an invitation.

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,199
In a few days,

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
Pavilion Master Xiaoyao Zun will visit in person.

45
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,159
Crimson Dawn Pavilion keeps opposing us.

46
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,919
Now Xiaoyao Zun is coming himself.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,759
I think he means trouble.

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
The Hongmeng Tournament is approaching.

49
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,759
Crimson Dawn Pavilion is on the rise.

50
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,360
We can't confront them head-on.

51
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,479
I also

52
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,159
can't lose courage before the fight.

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,599
Little Saint King, any wise ideas?

54
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,280
Please share them

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,560
so everyone here can learn.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,479
Simple.

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Kill a few of them

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,319
to send a warning.

59
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,000
That's right.

60
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,479
Crimson Dawn Pavilion is nothing to fear.

61
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,759
If we can't even handle Xiaoyao Zun,

62
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll write my name, Xuan You,

63
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,719
backwards from now on.

64
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,199
Wrong.

65
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,960
Xiaoyao Zun is not to be underestimated.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,120
We must not be careless.

67
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,479
This kid dares to provoke Xuan You.

68
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,599
There's going to be a good show.

69
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,680
Little Saint King is right.

70
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,280
Why is Xuan You speaking for him today?

71
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,479
You make it sound easy.

72
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,000
Who's going to do it?

73
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,000
You go.

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,919
Darn it, I'll go.

75
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,199
Why is Long Lin also speaking for Little Saint King?

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,879
Little Saint King is right.

77
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,000
We must not lose courage before the fight.

78
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,560
Why is the Sect Leader also speaking for this kid?

79
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,040
Which elder

80
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,600
is willing to fight?

81
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,079
Then let's

82
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,480
leave it to the Grand Elder to decide.

83
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,199
This matter still needs

84
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,920
careful consideration.

85
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,959
The people from Crimson Dawn Pavilion will arrive soon.

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,920
We must reach a decision now.

87
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,600
No.

88
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm a bit too tired today.

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,839
Let's talk about this another day.

90
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,600
Alright, Little Saint King.

91
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,720
Please go back and rest as soon as possible.

92
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,279
Did Xuan You take the wrong medicine today?

93
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,759
Everyone, disperse quickly.

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,160
Xuan You.

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,079
Why did you change your mind so quickly today?

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,079
Are you telling me how to do things?

97
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,000
Fine.

98
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,319
Old man.

99
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,240
Just you wait.

100
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,560
You're finished, you're finished.

101
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
You're done for.

102
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,920
Just wait, just wait.

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,439
Little Saint King.

104
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,959
Little Saint King.

105
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,920
Little Saint King.

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
Was my performance just now

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,560
satisfactory to you?

108
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,560
About the antidote...

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,639
By the way,

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,120
tonight,

111
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
help me kill someone.

112
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,079
Elder Yin Kui.

113
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,759
I didn't expect the envoy from Crimson Dawn Pavilion to be you.

114
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,040
Did you get the formation diagram of Supreme Clear Pool?

115
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,079
Xuan You and Yin Kui are both from Crimson Dawn Pavilion.

116
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,959
Yin Kui is.

117
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,800
Xuan You was controlled later.

118
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,000
I've been an undercover agent for Crimson Dawn Pavilion for years.

119
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,480
It's time to give me the antidote for the Serpent Venom Pill.

120
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,199
If you want the antidote,

121
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,120
bring me the formation diagram first.

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,480
Alright.

123
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,560
Are you crazy?

124
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,959
How dare you disrespect me!

125
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,079
Why are they fighting?

126
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,279
Because I turned Xuan You.

127
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,600
Two of my six elders are undercover agents.

128
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
And I had no idea.

129
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,759
I'm afraid that's not all.

130
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,240
You impostor!

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
The real envoy is Little Saint King.

132
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,120
He will give me the antidote.

133
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,040
You're also from Crimson Dawn Pavilion.

134
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,079
Be careful.

135
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,199
Don't let them see you.

136
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,720
If I were from Crimson Dawn Pavilion,

137
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,120
why would I bring you here?

138
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,839
If you dare betray Forget Immortal Sect,

139
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,160
I won't forgive you.

140
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,959
What about them?

141
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,879
Handle it as you see fit.

142
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,199
They're all trapped now.

143
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,079
Xuan You is already under your control.

144
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,519
Your people are my people.

145
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,360
Just keep him.

146
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,519
I'll deal with Yin Kui.

147
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,720
You really need to handle someone like that yourself?

148
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
I'll go, that's enough.

149
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,639
Who?

150
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,279
Little Saint King.

151
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,240
Little Saint King.

152
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,839
The task you assigned me,

153
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,839
I have completed it perfectly.

154
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,160
I have a new task for you.

155
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,120
They said over there,

156
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,959
Elder Yin Kui.

157
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,480
I really can't figure out

158
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,879
Forget Immortal Sect

159
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
what the Forget Immortal Sect ever did to wrong you.

160
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
Little Saint King.

161
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,159
I've done everything you asked.

162
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799
The antidote for the Serpent Venom Pill,

163
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,720
can you give it to me now?

164
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,639
Find everything on this list

165
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,759
and bring them to me.

166
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Then I'll completely cure your poison.

167
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,279
Remember,

168
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,639
complete the task with a smile.

169
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,039
But don't smile too widely,

170
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,000
or your beard will fall off.

171
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,440
This...

172
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,120
Th-this, I...

173
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,600
It's true.

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm not joking.

175
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,159
Don't look at me like I'm a fool.

176
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,240
Little Saint King.

177
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,080
I,

178
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
I will definitely complete the task.

179
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,679
The antidote, the antidote!

180
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,720
You pretended to be dead?

181
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,720
Despicable!

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,840
Oh no!

183
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
Qin Ji.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
The way you look today

185
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,120
is truly exciting.

186
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,799
I've been undercover in the Forget Immortal Sect for so many years,

187
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,440
and every time I see you,

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,960
I get thrilled.

189
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,840
How do you have such a strong spiritual barrier?

190
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,919
There are many things you don't know.

191
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,399
Who?

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,080
Is everyone in the Crimson Dawn Pavilion as monstrous as you?

193
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,200
Little Saint King.

194
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
I advise you not to meddle.

195
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,639
Little Saint King, you're nothing special.

196
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,360
How did you know my weak spot?

197
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
Go ask the King of Hell.

198
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,080
If I die, I'll take someone with me.

199
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,960
You've been hit by my Soul-Devouring Palm.

200
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,360
Even if you survive, you'll be half dead.

201
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,480
When that slap

202
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,639
was just three centimeters from me,

203
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,799
I wanted to explain to her.

204
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,720
A charming and elegant man like me

205
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,679
who is handsome and refined,

206
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,679
would never take advantage of someone.

207
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,039
But after a quarter-second of thought,

208
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,919
I decided to give up.

209
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,679
In this situation,

210
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,840
women never listen to explanations.

211
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,559
It's better to just

212
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
admit it directly.

213
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
It was Yin Kui.

214
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,200
Sorry.

215
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,200
It's fine.

216
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,000
You weren't wrong to hit me.

217
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,320
It's my fault for not thinking it through.

218
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,759
I put you in danger.

219
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,679
Crimson Dawn Pavilion has planted so many spies.

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
If war breaks out,

221
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,399
Forget Immortal Sect stands no chance.

222
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,480
But Forget Immortal Sect still has me.

223
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
Don't worry about the spies.

224
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,679
Lin Yue, Lin Yue!

225
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,799
Lin Yue.

226
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,720
Lin Yue.

227
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,919
Yiyi.

228
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,360
You're awake, Lin Yue!

229
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,679
Awake.

230
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,759
That's great!

231
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,240
I just woke up.

232
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,840
And you almost choked me out.

233
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,840
You’ve been unconscious for three days.

234
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,159
We were all worried about you.

235
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,240
Yiyi.

236
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,480
I’m fine.

237
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
You have to trust me.

238
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,080
Where’s Sect Leader Qin?

239
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,399
Sect Leader Qin is fine.

240
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,159
She was worried about you too.

241
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,679
She brought the best pills from Forget Immortal Sect.

242
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,600
She brought them all here.

243
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,240
I must thank Sect Leader Qin properly later.

244
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,679
And Chi’er.

245
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,399
She stayed with me and watched over you for three days.

246
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,440
Everyone’s kindness to me

247
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,679
is something I’ll never forget.

248
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,519
In the future,

249
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,960
I’ll serve you in any way possible.

250
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,600
No matter the danger,

251
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,519
I’ll come whenever you call.

252
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,879
You’re talking nonsense again.

253
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,240
Something terrible has happened!

254
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,000
The Lord Xiaoyao of Crimson Dawn Pavilion

255
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,120
has arrived with his disciples.
