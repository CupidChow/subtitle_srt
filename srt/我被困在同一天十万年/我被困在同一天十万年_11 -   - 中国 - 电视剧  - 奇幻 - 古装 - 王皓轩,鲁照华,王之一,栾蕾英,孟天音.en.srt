1
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,000
Father

2
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,719
Here's the list of sect members attending the auction.

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,799
Everything is recorded here.

4
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,200
Got it.

5
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,799
The most important thing next

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,120
is all written on this paper.

7
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,920
What's so important?

8
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,079
Come here.

9
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,000
Seize the day.

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,159
Don't wait until it's too late.

11
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:37,840
What does that mean?

12
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,040
It means

13
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,799
when fate arrives,

14
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,840
you have to grab it.

15
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,239
You and that Lin Yue, you two...

16
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,400
Lin Yue, Lin Yue...

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
You mention Lin Yue hundreds of times a day.

18
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,079
My lord,

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,040
I'm discussing city affairs with you.

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,480
Can you please take this seriously?

21
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,000
Yue'er, I'm your father.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,319
I care about your personal matters.

23
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,120
What's wrong?

24
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,159
I'm the Young Lord of Night King City.

25
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,040
Lin Yue is decent,

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,879
but I still need to test him.

27
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,840
How will you test him?

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,520
That's none of your concern.

29
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,120
Alright, I'm off to patrol the city.

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,199
Yue'er.

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,159
Seize the day.

32
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,960
Grasp your chance.

33
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,000
Pastries! Fresh pastries!

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,439
Young Lord.

35
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,120
Come try some fresh pastries.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,120
They're so exquisite.

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,240
I didn't know the city had such fine pastries.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,120
How much are they?

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,919
Young Lord, have a taste first.

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,159
Buy them only if you like them.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,199
Granny, you're not from around here, are you?

42
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,919
I haven't seen you before.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
I've just arrived here.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,319
This is the only skill I have.

45
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,680
Delicious.

46
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,800
Pack two for me.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,639
Alright.

48
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,000
Here you go, Young Lord.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,439
Put it on my tab.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,439
Okay.

51
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,280
Take care, Young Lord.

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,719
Why am I so dizzy?

53
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,520
Miss Ye!

54
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,400
What's wrong?

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,080
Are you alright?

56
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,120
You...

57
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,599
You seem to have been poisoned with Charm Poison.

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,919
Quick, take her to my room!

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,919
I need to save her.

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,319
Congratulations, Young Master.

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,800
Once what's done is done,

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,960
Lei Yun Sect and Night King City will be united by marriage.

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,319
You've achieved another great merit.

64
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,360
That's right.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,159
Hurry!

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,400
I didn't expect

67
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,800
you're not just a simp,

68
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,240
but also a creep.

69
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,639
You again, bumpkin.

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,759
Fine.

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,439
I'll kill you today.

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,960
I was going to spare you for now,

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,599
but that's not happening.

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,960
Young Master Lin, let me.

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,079
Protecting the Young Lord is my duty as Ye Xiao.

76
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,480
How dare you poison the Young Lord!

77
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,040
You've got some nerve!

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,800
I didn't poison her.

79
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,800
I was just passing by.

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,160
I just wanted...

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,800
Still trying to argue?

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,680
If you don't leave now,

83
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,319
you'll die in Night King City today.

84
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,040
I...

85
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,040
Just wait.

86
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,879
Young Master! Young Master!

87
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,399
Did I say you could leave?

88
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,920
Stop!

89
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,399
Young Master Lin.

90
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,279
The auction is about to start.

91
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,399
It's best not to cause trouble now.

92
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,759
We'll settle this later.

93
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,680
Alright.

94
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,399
Your turf, your rules.

95
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,800
Saving her comes first.

96
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,319
I hope Young Master Lin will take good care of the Young Lord.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,920
Which one of us is really her subordinate?

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,959
Miss Ye

99
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,839
I'll head out first.

100
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,160
Otherwise, people might really think

101
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,920
there's something going on between us.

102
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,879
Young Master Lin

103
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,800
Don't leave yet.

104
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,600
I'm really not feeling well.

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
You have to help me cure the poison.

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,639
Miss Ye

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,120
What should we do about this?

108
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,639
As for me,

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,879
I don't want to just stand by and do nothing.

110
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,480
But I don't want to act out of lust either.

111
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,439
Saving you is more important.

112
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,399
Then forgive me for any offense.

113
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,079
Come on, hurry.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,560
Are you crazy?

115
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,399
Young Master Lin

116
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,879
What are you doing?

117
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,120
I have another trick.

118
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,319
It can cure your Charm Poison.

119
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:13,720
Really?

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,759
I just need to slap you twenty times.

121
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,000
You'll definitely snap out of it.

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
If that's what it takes,

123
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,839
I'll endure it.

124
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
I have to get rid of this poison.

125
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,160
Is that really necessary?

126
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
Then let's begin.

127
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,199
Why do I suddenly feel much better?

128
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:27,879
I'm about to slap you.

129
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,279
I suddenly feel fine—let's start.

130
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,319
Miss Ye, are you ready?

131
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,720
Much better, I really feel much better.

132
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,560
It's fine now. Better a short pain than a long one.

133
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,920
Come on, come on.

134
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,439
It's fine now.

135
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm starting. I feel fine.

136
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,680
Alright, alright.

137
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:36,959
I'm cured.

138
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,639
Really cured.

139
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,319
When did you figure it out?

140
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,560
I noticed when I checked your pulse.

141
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,079
You showed no signs of poisoning at all.

142
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,319
Besides,

143
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,160
Lei Zong's little tricks

144
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,639
can't fool you.

145
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,759
Alright, alright, everyone.

146
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,240
Come out, come out.

147
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,560
See?

148
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,439
If I had done anything to you just now,

149
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,720
and you shouted "assault",

150
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,000
your brothers would have rushed in.

151
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,120
Then nothing could clear my name.

152
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
I just wanted to test you.

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
So how did I do?

154
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
You barely passed.

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
I have things to do, I'll leave now.

156
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,079
Go on, go on.

157
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,000
Thanks for your effort.

158
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:25,920
Much appreciated.

159
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:38,959
Miss Luo

160
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Why are you here too?

161
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,279
I want to stroll around the market.

162
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,639
Do you have time to join me?

163
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,279
Yes, I do.

164
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,120
Let's go.

165
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,360
Gambling house

166
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,360
I'll never gamble in my life

167
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
Especially not dice games

168
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,160
Did you hear?

169
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,480
Lin Yue, the Little Saint King of Wangxian Sect

170
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,959
broke Jun Wushang's Yao Qi record

171
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,839
Just a few days ago

172
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,759
dozens of Rotation Realm experts from Lei Yun Sect

173
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,560
surrounded him

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,759
He just coughed casually

175
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,399
and those experts were knocked out

176
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,439
Speaking of Lin Yue

177
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,160
he's quite charming

178
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,439
leaves hearts everywhere

179
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,560
Take that day for example

180
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,360
he and Qin Ji from Wangxian Sect

181
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,800
at the Supreme Clear Pool

182
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,080
dual cultivated in the rain

183
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,720
As the saying goes

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,440
the most beautiful thing isn't the Rotation Realm

185
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,600
but the mark left when dual cultivating with you

186
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,840
is the imprint left behind

187
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,080
Look

188
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,440
Young Master Lin, does it look good?

189
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,799
The bracelet is ordinary

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,399
but it'll look great on you

191
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
Boss, how much is it?

192
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,120
This is natural jade

193
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
crafted into a jade bracelet

194
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,519
Since the lady likes it

195
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,320
I'll give you a loss price

196
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,360
One hundred thousand

197
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,039
I'll sell it to you for 100,000 Yao Zhu

198
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,799
Is a bracelet really that expensive?

199
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,879
This is a rare treasure

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,120
Not just Night King City, I only have one like this

201
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,399
Looking across the Hongmeng Continent

202
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,879
bracelets of this quality

203
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,919
can be counted on one hand

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,600
I'll buy it for you

205
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,720
But let's bargain first

206
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,120
Madam Boss

207
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,080
Will you sell it for six hundred taels?

208
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,240
Deal

209
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,600
Here, take it

210
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,559
You called out too high

211
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,720
Didn't you say this bracelet is rare in the world?

212
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,519
Only one like it in all of Hongmeng Continent?

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
You'd need hundreds of hands to count them

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,480
100,000 Yao Zhu

215
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,679
That bracelet

216
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,759
I want it

217
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,639
Alright, alright

218
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,399
Here you go

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,639
I want the one on her hand

220
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,960
Boss

221
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,559
I'll offer 300,000

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,559
500,000

223
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,720
Plus ten years of free stall rent

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,679
One million

225
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,759
1.5 million

226
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,639
Two million

227
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,080
2.5 million

228
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,919
Three million

229
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,200
Four million

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
4.5 million

231
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,840
Five million

232
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,080
5.5 million

233
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Six million

234
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,200
You two

235
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
Don't be upset

236
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,039
Have some tea first

237
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,840
I'll drink

238
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:39,879
Me too

239
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,720
Will my fate

240
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,080
end up like this bracelet?

241
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Something's off
