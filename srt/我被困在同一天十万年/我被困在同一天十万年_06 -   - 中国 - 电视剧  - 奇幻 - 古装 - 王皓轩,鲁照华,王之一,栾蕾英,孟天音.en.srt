1
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,719
Thunderbolt Pill

2
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,239
If you're scared,

3
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,400
you don't have to take it.

4
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,480
I took it.

5
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Is there more?

6
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,400
It's pretty chewy.

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,599
In less than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn,

8
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,519
you'll explode and die.

9
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,120
Lin Yue

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm fine.

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,959
Tastes good.

12
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,439
You're doomed.

13
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,599
Lin Yue

14
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,239
Lin Yue! Lin Yue!

15
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,159
Lin Yue

16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,200
Lin Yue

17
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,599
Lin Yue

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,200
Sect Leader Qin, please save him!

19
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,879
I thought

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,519
he could last a whole incense stick.

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,079
I overestimated you.

22
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,159
You put Bamboo Cloud Grass in this pill.

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,879
Sect Leader Qin, you really are knowledgeable.

24
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,040
Where's the antidote?

25
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,519
If you want to save his life,

26
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,599
you must agree

27
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,759
to let Crimson Dawn Pavilion use the Supreme Pure Pool.

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,919
Xiaoyao Zun

29
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,080
So this is your real goal.

30
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,919
If you won't lend it,

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,400
just let this guy

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
die, that's fine too.

33
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:18,960
Sect Leader

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
The Little Saint King's life is at stake.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,759
Supreme Pure Pool

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,400
is just a formation.

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,199
What's the harm in lending it to them?

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,360
Even our own sect members can't enter the Supreme Pure Pool freely.

39
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,560
We can't let Crimson Dawn Pavilion people in.

40
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,080
Long Lin

41
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,680
The Little Saint King has always treated you well.

42
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,400
Yet today you stand by and do nothing.

43
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,199
Are you still one of our sect?

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,080
You...

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
This Little Saint King

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,319
was injured for the sake of Wangxian Sect.

47
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,120
Sect Leader

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,879
You'd better think carefully.

49
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,479
No need to think about it.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
How could it turn out like this?

51
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,439
It's all an act.

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
If I didn't act, how would I know

53
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,439
who else you planted as spies in Wangxian Sect?

54
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,400
Grand Elder

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,919
Second Elder

56
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,520
You two

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,719
How dare you side with Crimson Dawn Pavilion

58
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,919
Don't you dare slander us

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,840
W-What is this thing?

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Just took it from Ge Zhen

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,159
Seems to be a spirit medicine from Crimson Dawn Pavilion

62
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,240
Heart-Devouring Pill

63
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,080
What's a Heart-Devouring Pill?

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,960
Once swallowed

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,680
It blocks your meridians

66
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,199
Causes excess Radiant Qi

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,080
You'll never be able to cultivate again

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
Lord

69
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,879
Lord

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,680
Lord, save me

71
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,960
Lord, please save me

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,680
Useless filth

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,240
You even dirtied my new robe

74
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,919
This is your own business

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm not getting involved

76
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,879
See you at the Primordial Battle

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,599
Alright

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,599
Today's score

79
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,400
We'll settle it then

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,879
Let's go

81
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,360
So filthy

82
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,199
Junior Sister

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,639
Junior Sister, wait for me

84
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,439
Young Saint King

85
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,360
Young Saint King

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,159
Young Saint King

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
Sect Leader, Young Saint King

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,919
Help!

89
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,599
I was wrong

90
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Help!

91
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,080
I won't dare again

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,719
From now on

93
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,319
You must devote yourselves fully to the Wangxian Sect

94
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,400
Otherwise

95
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,879
I'll personally deal with both of you

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,759
We swear loyalty! We swear loyalty!

97
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,319
Of course

98
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,600
Sect Leader

99
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,160
Are we just letting Lord Xiaoyao leave like that?

100
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,639
Right now, our strength

101
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,879
isn't enough to match theirs

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,639
Before the Primordial Battle

103
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,800
We still have many important matters

104
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,800
Thank you, Sect Leader, for trusting me

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,199
And thank you all

106
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,560
for supporting me as the Young Saint King

107
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,959
The Primordial Battle is approaching

108
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,839
If we want our Wangxian Sect

109
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,439
to win in the Primordial Battle

110
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,279
I've made

111
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
a new training plan

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,560
The Primordial Battle

113
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,000
is like a single-plank bridge

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
If you don't work hard now

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,439
you'll suffer for a lifetime across all corners of the world

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,839
Starting today

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,720
Attendance check at six every morning

118
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,199
Ends at nine in the evening

119
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:58,720
You must also

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,439
check in

121
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,480
No being late

122
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,360
No leaving early

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,439
Miss one check-in

124
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,199
and it's considered skipping cultivation

125
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,240
Miss twice

126
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,319
and you're expelled from the sect

127
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,959
Disciples below the Third Cycle Realm

128
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,199
will have weekends cancelled

129
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
Higher ranks must help lower ranks

130
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,560
The path of cultivation is tough

131
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
but dreams can take you far

132
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,600
Train with tears today

133
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,120
and gain divine insight tomorrow

134
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,560
May you become your own sun

135
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,879
and shine with Radiant Qi

136
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
Young Saint King! Young Saint King!

137
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,680
Young Saint King! Young Saint King!

138
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,600
Young Saint King! Young Saint King!

139
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,800
If only every night

140
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,519
could be like this

141
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,240
watching the moon together

142
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,639
You watch the moon

143
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,240
I'll just watch you

144
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,160
Young Saint King

145
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,279
Reporting to Young Saint King

146
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,160
Fortunately

147
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,480
I did not fail my mission

148
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,519
Nicely done.

149
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,879
During this time,

150
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
I have to start working.

151
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,279
I won't be able to play with you anymore.

152
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,680
Remember this.

153
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,879
I can cure your poison.

154
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
But I can also poison you.

155
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
From now on, behave yourself.

156
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,720
Don't do evil again.

157
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes.

158
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,160
Thank you, Young Saint King.

159
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,759
Thank you, Young Saint King.

160
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,040
I will remember this.

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,839
Obsidian.

162
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,399
Snow Pearl.

163
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,319
Wild Lingzhi.

164
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,839
The materials for making the Undying Puppet are finally ready.

165
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,160
How can you look like this?

166
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,120
Yeah.

167
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,199
You're way too ugly.

168
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Right?

169
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,680
No, that's not it.

170
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,800
I must have messed up the formation.

171
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,639
Exactly.

172
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,000
I need to break you down and remake you.

173
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,120
Never heard of that.

174
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,720
Are you trying to be funny?

175
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,879
Your formation is pretty good.

176
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:30,800
Like this,

177
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,959
this isn't my final form.

178
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,839
Once I finish evolving,

179
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,920
I can help you then.

180
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,199
So what use are you now?

181
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,959
I can offer you emotional support.

182
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,920
Emotional support?

183
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,279
Thanks, I guess.

184
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't need it.

185
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,720
What's wrong with you?

186
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,639
I'm not done playing yet.

187
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,000
Sect Leader Qin.

188
00:07:59,319 --> 00:07:59,720
Why are you here?

189
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,319
I just sensed

190
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,079
someone setting up a formation

191
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,319
and refining an artifact.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,639
That was me.

193
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
I made a puppet.

194
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,720
But there seems to be a problem.

195
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,079
Upgrading the Supreme Pure Pool,

196
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,279
setting up the Mystic Heaven Formation,

197
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,560
and creating the Undying Puppet—

198
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,319
so you really plan to take on the Demon Emperor of Seven Sins?

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,199
You're not joking, are you?

200
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,319
Of course.

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,839
Do you realize

202
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,399
this could drag the whole Wangxian Sect into trouble?

203
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,319
Alright.

204
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,320
The Night King City Auction is coming up.

205
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,080
There's something I want there.

206
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,159
As for me,

207
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,879
I just need an invitation to the Night King City Auction.

208
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,360
Give it to me.

209
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,200
From now on,

210
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,759
I won't involve Wangxian Sect anymore.

211
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,080
I can give you the invitation.

212
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,399
You can also use all the Radiant Pearls from Wangxian Sect.

213
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,519
They're yours to use.

214
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,399
I have only one condition.

215
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,279
Regarding the Demon Emperor of Seven Sins,

216
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,799
don't drag Wangxian Sect into it.

217
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
Thank you, Sect Leader.

218
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,600
Then tomorrow,

219
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,320
I'll set out alone.

220
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,200
to Night King City.

221
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,080
I won't bring Yiyi.

222
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,120
I still think it's safer to go alone.

223
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,840
While I'm away,

224
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,720
please take care of Yiyi, Sect Leader Qin.

225
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Darn it, something's wrong!

226
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,720
Yiyi is missing!
