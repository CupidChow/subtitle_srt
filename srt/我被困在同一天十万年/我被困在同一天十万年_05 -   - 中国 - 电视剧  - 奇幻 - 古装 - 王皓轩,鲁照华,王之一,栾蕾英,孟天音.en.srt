1
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,519
Break!

2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,640
Step back.

3
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,480
Yes, yes.

4
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,799
Sister.

5
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,400
It's all my fault.

6
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,079
I just played a little tune.

7
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,040
I didn't expect them all to go crazy.

8
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,239
It's all because of me.

9
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
Just playing a random tune.

10
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,000
Why use the Heavenly Demon Bone Flute?

11
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,079
But to me,

12
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,920
it's just playing a tune.

13
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,400
I overestimated the Wangxian Sect.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,319
Jiuque.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
Is that how you speak to the Sect Leader Qin?

16
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,079
Master.

17
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,800
Sect Leader Qin.

18
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,759
It's been years.

19
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,199
Sect Leader Xiaoyao visits in person.

20
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,879
What guidance do you have for us?

21
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,800
The Hongmeng Duel is approaching.

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,840
I've come to visit your sect in advance.

23
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,080
This isn't a visit.

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
You're clearly here to provoke us.

25
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,599
Let the disciples get to know each other.

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,879
So when we enter the Hongmeng Secret Realm,

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,000
we won't harm our relations.

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,639
Chixiao Pavilion has come from afar.

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,680
We of the Wangxian Sect

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,759
will gladly accompany you.

31
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,599
Wangxian Sect's Little Saint King

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,879
greets Sect Leader Xiaoyao.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,719
You're still not well.

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,960
You didn't need to come.

35
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,560
If I didn't come,

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,520
how would I watch these clowns perform?

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,400
I've long heard Elder Yinkui and Sect Leader Qin are evenly matched.

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,560
Neither surpasses the other.

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Why aren't they here today?

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,439
Elder Yinkui has urgent matters.

41
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,960
No need for Sect Leader to worry.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,960
I've heard about Elder Yinkui.

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,080
Sect Leader Xiaoyao cares so much about Elder Yinkui.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,680
Is there something personal between you two?

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,479
Or perhaps

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,319
the mighty Chixiao Pavilion

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,199
would stoop to bribing elders

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,479
and planting spies in other sects?

49
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,240
Such dirty, disgraceful acts.

50
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,360
I'll remember you.

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,759
During the Hongmeng Duel,

52
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,639
you'd better be there.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Jiuque.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,199
Since everyone's here,

55
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,759
for the music section,

56
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,479
let Wangxian Sect's elders give some guidance.

57
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,919
Such a beautiful lady,

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,039
later on,

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,240
go easy on her.

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
Jiuque of Chixiao Pavilion,

61
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,759
skilled in classical music.

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,719
Brothers and sisters of Wangxian Sect,

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,039
please give me your guidance.

64
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,800
Linyue.

65
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,439
Take her down.

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,280
Elder Longlin.

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,120
You go.

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,680
Me?

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,599
Little Saint King.

70
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,599
I'm not the right choice.

71
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,639
I only know

72
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,680
sword techniques.

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,080
Just sing a song with her.

74
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,479
That's even worse.

75
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,599
I can't sing.

76
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,159
Trust me.

77
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,319
Big brother,

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,959
what instrument do you play?

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,079
Me...

80
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,240
I sing.

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
W-what?

82
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,519
Don't worry, little sister.

83
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,839
My singing

84
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,319
isn't flashy.

85
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,000
It's all natural.

86
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,079
I'm afraid soon

87
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,720
you'll lose in a very ugly way.

88
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,000
Then bring it on.

89
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,680
Elder Long didn't use Aura Energy to stop it.

90
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,000
Why didn't he?

91
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,199
He didn't react at all.

92
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,000
Because

93
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,399
he's a

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,279
tone

95
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,879
deaf.

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,120
What?

97
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,240
For Jiuque's musical array to work,

98
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,120
the opponent must at least understand

99
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,240
the basics of

100
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,519
Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, Yu (traditional Chinese musical notes).

101
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,079
But Elder Longlin is tone-deaf.

102
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,519
So Jiuque's musical array

103
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,839
has no effect on him.

104
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,360
Even so,

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
how did he beat the opponent?

106
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,639
You'll see soon.

107
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,600
Two tigers,

108
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,759
two tigers,

109
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,319
running fast,

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,480
running fast.

111
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,439
One has no tail,

112
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,519
one has no brain.

113
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,920
How strange!

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,639
Stop singing!

115
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,439
I told you to stop singing!

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,360
Junior Sister,

117
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,199
my Junior Sister is skilled in music,

118
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,079
and she's a master of the Triple Wheel Realm.

119
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,279
How could she lose to such an awful song?

120
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,839
She lost precisely because she's skilled in music.

121
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,680
Impossible!

122
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,800
Elder Longlin's song

123
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,000
to those who don't understand music,

124
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,879
is completely off-key.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
But to music masters,

126
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,639
it's as terrifying as the Seven Tribulations Demon Emperor.

127
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,120
I've never

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,279
I've never heard such a terrible song.

129
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,600
I lost.

130
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,480
I lost.

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,240
Alright.

132
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,160
Round two.

133
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,720
I'll compete with you.

134
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,120
Compete in what?

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,240
In

136
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,680
taking medicine.

137
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you crazy?

138
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,639
You came all this way just to compete in taking medicine?

139
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,079
We'll each take

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,879
the other's spiritual supplement.

141
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,759
Whoever takes it and is fine

142
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,279
wins.

143
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,079
This is my senior disciple, Ge Zhen.

144
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,399
He likes to study

145
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,399
medicines and pills.

146
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,959
You're the most mysterious pill master

147
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
in the Hongmeng Continent.

148
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,120
It's just a nickname.

149
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,040
Sect Leader Qin, don't take it seriously.

150
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,319
Sect Leader,

151
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,600
who is this pill master?

152
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,959
Kills without a trace.

153
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,560
One pill does the job.

154
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,920
Legend says he's skilled at making pills.

155
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
And his pills contain no toxins.

156
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,079
They're all made from spiritual herbs.

157
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
If you can absorb the spiritual energy,

158
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,600
your cultivation will soar in a short time.

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,000
Then he's a good person!

160
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,199
But if you can't absorb the energy,

161
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,399
your body will overload with Aura Energy

162
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,800
and you'll explode from within.

163
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,920
That's terrifying!

164
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,519
But this time, you've run into us.

165
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,759
Are you sure you want to compete?

166
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,800
In the whole Hongmeng Continent,

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,959
when it comes to taking medicine,

168
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
I've never feared anyone.

169
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,959
You're asking for trouble.

170
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:29,959
Yiyi,

171
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:30,759
you'll go for this round.

172
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,160
Me?

173
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,079
Lin Yue,

174
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,319
I don't think that's a good idea.

175
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,639
Yiyi can't handle Ge Zhen.

176
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,439
Yiyi just needs to make the medicine.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,839
I'll take the opponent's medicine.

178
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,360
Lin Yue,

179
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,639
what are you talking about?

180
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,959
How could I possibly make medicine?

181
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,439
Just make that thing you made last time,

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
the Stargazing Cake.

183
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,560
How could that work?

184
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,480
My skills

185
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,879
aren't good enough.

186
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,360
Stargazing Cake

187
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,639
I usually don't let outsiders eat it.

188
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,480
Just an ordinary pastry.

189
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,839
How can it look so ugly?

190
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,600
You from Chixiao Pavilion came all this way,

191
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,759
and we from Wangxian Sect

192
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
of course have to show our hospitality.

193
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,240
Lin Yue,

194
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,080
look,

195
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,799
he was so amazed by my pastry

196
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,000
that he knelt down on his own.

197
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,200
Who would’ve thought

198
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,320
such an ugly pastry

199
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,639
could be so powerful.

200
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,639
Next time,

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,279
I’ll have to ask you for advice.

202
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,000
Lin Yue,

203
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,120
he insulted me.

204
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,960
You should know,

205
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,279
last time with this pastry,

206
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,120
I ate three pieces.

207
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
Impressive, truly.

208
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,759
I’m impressed with myself too.

209
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,919
Looks like

210
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,159
I’ll have to bring out my signature treasure.

211
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,840
Thunderbolt Pill.
