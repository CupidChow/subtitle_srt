1
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,040
Something's off.

2
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,560
These two people

3
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
are acting strange.

4
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,280
I noticed it too.

5
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,519
I saw it as soon as I walked in.

6
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Then tell me,

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,159
what's strange about them?

8
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,760
These two,

9
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,000
plain clothes,

10
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,079
average build,

11
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,239
ordinary looks.

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,560
At first glance,

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
they seem like regular people with no cultivation.

14
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,120
But with the auction coming up,

15
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,719
ordinary folks wouldn't show up.

16
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,040
So,

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
they must be

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,200
experts hiding their cultivation.

19
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,159
They've come to Night King City with a secret agenda.

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,799
Trying to keep a low profile and avoid attention.

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,719
Am I right,

22
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,560
Young Master Lin?

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,319
I was talking about

24
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,400
that table being suspicious.

25
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,359
With the way they're dressed,

26
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,879
even a blind man could tell they're odd.

27
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,560
Am I right,

28
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,159
Young Master Lin?

29
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,639
Stay sharp later.

30
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,840
We must succeed in this mission.

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,680
After all, the target is Qin Wunian.

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,800
When we strike tomorrow, make sure it's a fatal blow.

33
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,680
Qin Wunian.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,479
Daring to cause trouble in Night King City.

35
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,759
I'll arrest them right now.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,319
I think

37
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,319
I'll just watch the show.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,280
Brother,

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,199
aren't our clothes a bit too flashy?

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
What do you know?

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,919
This shows we're professionals.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,759
First, use Soft Fragrance Powder to knock him out.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,599
Then sneak into the room.

44
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,479
Finish him off with one strike.

45
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,800
Qin Wunian,

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,879
someone paid me to take your life.

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
Just accept your fate.

48
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,599
What's going on?

49
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,919
Another assassin?

50
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,960
No idea.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,960
Does Qin Wunian have that many enemies?

52
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,759
No rush.

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,400
Let those two fight to the death first.

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,240
We'll reap the spoils of victory.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
Petty thief,

56
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,360
you talk big.

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,080
Take this!

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,319
Pure cultivation, fierce moves.

59
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
Calm under pressure, impressive presence.

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,039
You are truly admirable.

61
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,199
Palace Master Qin is the real young hero.

62
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,759
You're too kind.

63
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,959
Not at all.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
I feel like we've known each other for ages.

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,920
How about

66
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,079
we sit down and chat over a drink?

67
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,319
Please.

68
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,120
Please.

69
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,319
Try the wine from our Biluo Shangqing Palace.

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,439
What's going on?

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,839
Why are they drinking now?

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's just take out both of them.

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,439
Brother Qin,

74
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,000
no offense,

75
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,279
but your wine

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,720
is really terrible.

77
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,600
Are you okay?

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm fine.

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,720
But I think I swallowed the Soft Fragrance Powder.

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,480
Looks like things aren't going well today.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,839
Should we just leave?

82
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,560
No.

83
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,560
We can't leave.

84
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,319
If we don't get Qin Wunian's head,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,600
we won't get our payment.

86
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,600
Can you...

87
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,000
Let me rest for a bit first.

88
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,879
Alright.

89
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,120
What a pity.

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,920
If I hadn't been paid to kill you,

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,560
I would really want to be your friend.

92
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,000
How much did they pay you?

93
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,360
I'll double it.

94
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,519
That won't do.

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,879
You're challenging a killer's principles.

96
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,759
I wonder how much Qin's head is worth.

97
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,879
Probably not much.

98
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,519
Just ten million.

99
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,959
After the job's done,

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
there's another ten million as a final payment.

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
That's outrageous.

102
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,720
The payment they offered us

103
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,000
is only five million in total.

104
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,720
Didn't you say it was only four million?

105
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,279
You pocketed another million.

106
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,079
Don't worry about the details.

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,639
Who sent you to kill me?

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
I can't tell you that.

109
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,360
As a killer,

110
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
I have my limits.

111
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,399
Even for twenty million, you won't say?

112
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,959
Our employer treats me well.

113
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,560
Not only did they give me twenty million,

114
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,240
they even found two black-clad scapegoats

115
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,920
to wear down your strength for me.

116
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,240
Makes it easier for me to succeed.

117
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,759
Even if I kill you, you won't say?

118
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,920
I can't say.

119
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,439
What's so secret?

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,079
Isn't it just those old men from Shangqing Palace?

121
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,000
So stingy.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,879
They even want us brothers to be scapegoats.

123
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,519
You two arrived just in time.

124
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,879
Why don't the three of us join forces?

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,199
I'll give you thirty percent of my payment.

126
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,839
Are we really that spineless

127
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,120
and unprincipled?

128
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,000
Want us brothers to be scapegoats?

129
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,079
No way.

130
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,199
Those old guys from Biluo Shangqing Palace

131
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,439
are really despicable.

132
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,759
They're

133
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
trampling on our dignity as killers.

134
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,160
So what do you two plan to do?

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,920
What to do?

136
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,480
Of course, we'll expose

137
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,360
those old men's ugly faces in the industry.

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,920
Don't worry.

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,839
No one will take their jobs in the future.

140
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,160
Farewell.

141
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,560
Trying to leave?

142
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,360
Brother Qin,

143
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,079
no need to chase them.

144
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,040
This will save you a lot of trouble in the future.

145
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,040
Brother Lin,

146
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,279
I'm starting to appreciate you.

147
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,560
Thank you for your kindness, Young Lord.

148
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,600
But I think

149
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,199
there's no need to go to such trouble.

150
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,199
Palace Master Qin doesn't trust us.

151
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,519
With the Young Lord as guarantor,

152
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,680
and Brother Lin being the Little Saint King of Wangxian Sect,

153
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,920
there's no reason to doubt.

154
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,240
But for just a few petty thieves,

155
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,240
is it worth setting up this scheme?

156
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,959
Why not just kill them directly?

157
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,399
Wouldn't that be easier?

158
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,600
Of course, I know Brother Qin's strength.

159
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,920
But

160
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,079
aren't you curious

161
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,399
who's behind all this?

162
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,199
That's right.

163
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,399
Doesn't Palace Master Qin want to see a good show?

164
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright.

165
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,360
Then I'll gladly accept.

166
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,079
Brother Qin,

167
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,360
to be honest,

168
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,160
I want to be your friend

169
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,639
because of what I plan to do in the future.

170
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,279
I'll need your help.

171
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,240
What we aim for in the future

172
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,759
is not just a momentary impulse.

173
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:27,959
I believe

174
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,560
you have the vision and character for it, Brother Qin.

175
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,080
I’ll keep your advice in mind, Lin.

176
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,039
But I’m not sure what you meant by your intentions.

177
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,159
I’ll head back for today.

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,639
You should rest too, Qin.

179
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,440
We have the auction to attend tomorrow.

180
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,080
Goodbye.

181
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,559
Take care.

182
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,200
Qin Wunian.

183
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,080
I hope in the future

184
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
you won’t disappoint me.

185
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,000
Master Cheng.

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Here you are again.

187
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,039
Come, this way please.

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
How many treasures did you bring this time?

189
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,679
It depends on how many valuables you have.

190
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,200
There are quite a few treasures this time.

191
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,759
Lin Yue.

192
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,879
You dare show your face?

193
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,519
Return my hundred million Yao Zhu!

194
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,840
Lei Zong.

195
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Don’t talk nonsense.

196
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,679
What hundred million Yao Zhu?

197
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,440
Stop pretending with me.

198
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,679
Our Lei Yun Sect is the top sect in Night King City.

199
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,840
I’ll show you what happens when you cross me.

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,759
Beat him up!

201
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,039
Lin.

202
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,679
What’s going on here?

203
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
Do you need me to deal with him?

204
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,279
Got Biluo Shangqing Palace backing you up, huh?

205
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:46,840
Fine.

206
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Just wait.

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
You’ll be alone sooner or later.

208
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,240
Just you wait.
