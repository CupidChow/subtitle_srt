1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,560
Stop.

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Yiyi is missing.

3
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,280
Aren't you worried at all?

4
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,680
What if she was taken by Red Dawn Pavilion?

5
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,200
They wouldn't dare.

6
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:15,719
No way.

7
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,480
You have to come with me to find Yiyi.

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,439
Yiyi really misjudged you.

9
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,799
I'll teach you a lesson for her.

10
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,480
Obsessed one.

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,000
Stop!

12
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,239
Well?

13
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,560
I told you she'd show up.

14
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,760
You...

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Love-struck fool.

16
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,680
Can't you tell we were acting?

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,000
I was just worried about you two.

18
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,120
I knew you wouldn't take me to Night King City.

19
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,079
So I wanted to sneak off myself.

20
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,280
Night King City is too complicated.

21
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,879
I'm afraid it's too dangerous for you.

22
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,359
Then don't go alone either.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,159
If you think my cultivation level is too low,

24
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,200
you can bring Sword Maniac with you.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
Aren't they preparing for the Primordial Duel?

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,439
Don't worry.

27
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,480
I promise you.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,960
I'll definitely come back safe.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,840
Alright.

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,000
This is...

31
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,400
I made these flower pastries overnight.

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,439
Take them for the road.

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,159
Touched?

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,599
Very touched.

35
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,960
I'll keep them for self-defense.

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,159
Oh, right.

37
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,719
Take my Cloud Soaring Boat with you too.

38
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,360
What?

39
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,000
You're letting him use the Cloud Soaring Boat?

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,120
Night King City is so far away.

41
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,280
Only if he has the Cloud Soaring Boat

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,919
will I feel at ease.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,479
Cloud Soaring Boat...

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,599
Didn't expect you to have such a powerful magical artifact.

45
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,280
It's called Cloud Soaring Boat,

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,879
but only travels ten miles a day? That's a rip-off.

47
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,759
Sorry, sir.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
We're fully booked tonight.

49
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,400
Flying boat...

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,639
Looks like we'll have to camp outside tonight.

51
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,479
Wait, that's odd.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,360
They said it's full,

53
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,520
but there's not a single horse here.

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,719
Sorry, sir.

55
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,199
Salvation Realm.

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Boat, wait for me!

57
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,159
Hurry up and do it.

58
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,240
Who?

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,479
Just a guest.

60
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,280
It's you.

61
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,279
I already let you go once.

62
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,959
And now you come back to die?

63
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,720
So you're in the Spirit Realm.

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,120
Just finish him with one strike.

65
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,720
Who are you, really?

66
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,120
Luo Yixue.

67
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,519
Why is it you?

68
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Be more careful next time.

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
I put some shining pearls in here.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,040
I'll leave them here for you.

71
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,959
This sachet

72
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,360
will help you recover your strength.

73
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,720
Take it for now.

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,519
The young lady of Flying Cloud Chamber of Commerce.

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
How did you end up like this?

76
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,759
Are you alright?

77
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,199
Here we go again.

78
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,839
This scene feels familiar.

79
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,759
Good thing she has no cultivation.

80
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,879
Not as ruthless as Qin Ji.

81
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,399
Such strength!

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,279
Stay away!

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,759
You've got it wrong, it wasn't me.

84
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,279
Libertine!

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,079
I'll fight you!

86
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,399
Let me explain!

87
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,319
Xiaoxue.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,759
Are you in there?

89
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,839
Uncle.

90
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,680
Who is this?

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
Everyone, let me explain.

92
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,560
That's how it happened.

93
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,680
Xiaoxue,

94
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,480
It seems this gentleman really did save you.

95
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm sorry, my benefactor.

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,000
I misunderstood you.

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,040
May I ask your name, sir?

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,720
My surname is Lin, Lin Yue.

99
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,160
But you don't need to thank me.

100
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,360
Because you saved me too.

101
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,680
What?

102
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,199
Since the lady is safe now,

103
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,439
then let's

104
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,120
until we meet again.

105
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,319
May I ask where you're headed?

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,079
Night King City.

107
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,759
We're also going to Night King City.

108
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,399
If you don't mind, you can travel with us.

109
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,279
You can use our Wind Fire Thunder Ship.

110
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,560
Your naming style for mounts

111
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,519
is really consistent.

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,079
Xiaoxue,

113
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,279
It might not be convenient for Mr. Lin.

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
It's convenient, very convenient.

115
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,319
It's perfect.

116
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,879
I'll take this Wind Fire Thunder Ship.

117
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,839
It looks

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
much easier to ride than my Cloud Soaring Boat.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,560
Come on, come on.

120
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,920
Xiaoxue,

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,240
I've sent those servants back.

122
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,480
Uncle,

123
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,600
They've been with me for years.

124
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,040
Could you

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,319
Xiaoxue, mercy has no place in leadership.

126
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,879
You'll understand in time.

127
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,720
Is everything arranged?

128
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
It's all taken care of.

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,439
My people

130
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,040
will act on her way to Night King City.

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,959
Miss Luo, your embroidery is excellent.

132
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,639
Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Lin.

133
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,199
It's for my uncle.

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,759
Miss Luo, didn't you find yesterday's attack

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,439
a bit suspicious?

136
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,639
Uncle already told me.

137
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,879
The Zhao family covets our family fortune.

138
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
It was your uncle's scheme.

139
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,680
It was him.

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,839
He wants your family's wealth.

141
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,240
Do you have any proof, Mr. Lin?

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,600
I heard it myself.

143
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,839
Where?

144
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,040
Right here.

145
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,360
When?

146
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
About fifty thousand years ago.

147
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,360
To be precise,

148
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,279
it was forty-seven thousand three hundred years ago.

149
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,160
Mr. Lin,

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,879
My uncle has devoted himself to our Luo family.

151
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,440
He treats me like his own child.

152
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,879
I was grateful for your help before.

153
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,200
I thought we could look out for each other on the way.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,399
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

155
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,240
Our paths diverge.

156
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Please leave, Mr. Lin.

157
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,720
Please go.

158
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,440
Xiaoxue.

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Where's that Lin Yue?

160
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,279
Uncle,

161
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,639
I think I misjudged him.

162
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,279
He's not a good person.

163
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,799
I also think that Mr. Lin

164
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,720
is a bit suspicious.

165
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,679
By the way,

166
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,480
I know you have trouble sleeping, uncle.

167
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
I made this scented pouch for you.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,759
Inside,

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,519
I put some herbs to help you sleep.

170
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Thank you, Xiaoxue.

171
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,879
Do you know why I can't sleep?

172
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,080
Ever since your father passed away,

173
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,919
this huge family business

174
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,519
has been managed by me alone.

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,639
It's a lot to worry about.

176
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,639
I've already thought of

177
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,519
a way to share your burden.

178
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,720
Once we reach Night King City,

179
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,519
I have a good solution too.

180
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
As long as you're dead,

181
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,639
I'll finally get a good night's sleep.

182
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,039
Uncle!

183
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
What did you say?

184
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,840
I said,

185
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,919
you must die.

186
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,960
I arranged the inn incident before.

187
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,200
That brat ruined it.

188
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,559
This time,

189
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
I, your uncle,

190
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,360
will personally send you on your way.
