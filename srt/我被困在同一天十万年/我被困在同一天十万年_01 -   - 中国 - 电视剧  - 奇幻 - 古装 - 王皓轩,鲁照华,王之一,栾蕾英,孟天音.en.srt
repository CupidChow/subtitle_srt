1
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,040
Who goes there?

2
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,879
Look over here.

3
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,120
I'm Lin Yue.

4
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,480
No need to say more.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,280
Obviously, I'm the main character.

6
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
This is the Seven Sins Demon Emperor.

7
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,719
No need to say more.

8
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,599
Clearly, he's the big villain.

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,760
These are his henchmen.

10
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,959
No need to introduce them one by one.

11
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,159
How many times have I died here?

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,239
15,826 times.

13
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,640
Or was it 37,422 times?

14
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,560
After dying so many times,

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,640
I've learned everything about everyone

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,799
in the Demon Emperor's Hall—their every move and technique,

17
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,599
their hobbies and interests,

18
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,079
I know them all inside out.

19
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,919
And I've made a major discovery.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,599
The fruit in the Demon Emperor's Hall is really fresh.

21
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,800
Bro,

22
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,479
don't be upset.

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,840
It's not your first time hitting your own teammate.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,879
Alright,

25
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,080
happy times fly by.

26
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,759
The Demon Emperor is about to make his move.

27
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,159
Guess what,

28
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,840
can I withstand his Asura Form this time?

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,319
After all,

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,199
this time,

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,719
I'm different from before.

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,840
Or maybe not that different.

33
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Sorry,

34
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,199
I failed again.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,719
It's been 100,000 years.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,439
My name is Lin Yue.

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,719
I was just an ordinary person on the Primordial Continent.

38
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,039
Just a regular cultivator.

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,280
But I got trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day.

40
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,520
No matter what happens that day,

41
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,840
after twelve shichen,

42
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,280
I return to the same place on the same day.

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,319
Another boring day.

44
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,759
Repeats again.

45
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,800
In these 100,000 years,

46
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
my cultivation stayed at the Mortal Realm,

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,439
but my spiritual sense grew incredibly strong over countless years.

48
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,479
It became unbelievably powerful.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,520
I also gained endless combat experience.

50
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,400
For a full 100,000 years,

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
I kept trying my luck with teleportation arrays.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,520
I traveled everywhere.

53
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
I came to join sects and cultivate.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,919
Met all the powerful people.

55
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Got beaten up a lot.

56
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,520
Mortal Realm trash.

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,479
Still want to play hero, huh?

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,319
In broad daylight,

59
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,120
you're robbing me?

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,199
Beat him up.

61
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,759
Suffered a lot.

62
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,000
Mortal Realm scum.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,479
You still want to cultivate?

64
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,080
I learned all the secrets.

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,639
My people will strike on her way to Night King City.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,439
I also met

67
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,800
all the most beautiful women on the Primordial Continent.

68
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,319
At first,

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
I didn't think being trapped by time

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
was a punishment.

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,120
Until I

72
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
fell in love with a girl.

73
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,920
So for you,

74
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,800
you've already met me during these 100,000 years.

75
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:40,920
Yes.

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Countless times.

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,480
To be exact,

78
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,240
it's 5,201,314 times.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,720
Every time,

80
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,360
you were poisoned by Charm Poison.

81
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,199
And I

82
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,319
under this moonlight,

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,720
helped you detoxify.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,560
Shut up.

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Do you really think I,

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,199
the Saintess, would believe your nonsense now?

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,079
Get lost.

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
I can't leave.

89
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,160
Wait, I

90
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
still need to help you with the Charm Poison.

91
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,759
I'll count to ten.

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,319
If you don't leave,

93
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,240
I'll really kill you.

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,199
Counting to five is enough.

95
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,879
They'll be here.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Who?

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,600
The ones after you.

98
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,120
Turns out they're disciples of Forget Immortal Sect.

99
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,959
You'll be surprised to find out

100
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,560
it's actually

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Situ Jue.

102
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,480
One of his men revealed their goal.

103
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,480
Congratulations, young master.

104
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
The little Saintess has an Innate Spiritual Body.

105
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,639
If you take her body,

106
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,519
your cultivation level

107
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,639
will definitely break through.

108
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,439
Then Situ Jue said,

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
The little Saintess has a fiery temper.

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,199
This poison dart,

111
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,519
I need to aim carefully.

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,079
I don't like people resisting.

113
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,079
Then you angrily said,

114
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,839
Situ Jue,

115
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,240
how dare you have such shameless, despicable thoughts!

116
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,519
Aren't you afraid of the Sect Leader's punishment?

117
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,399
Then Situ Jue replied,

118
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,079
Sect Leader?

119
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,079
Sect Leader?

120
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,639
Would she dare offend my father?

121
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,480
Where did this Mortal Realm trash come from?

122
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,959
Kill him.

123
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,439
Don't mess up my aim.

124
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,600
You've got some nerve.

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you know who my father is?

126
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,319
Your father is Situ Xuanyou.

127
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,800
He's just someone from our Red Dawn Pavilion.

128
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,800
Nothing but a dog.

129
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:25,759
You're just a messenger.

130
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,920
My status

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,480
isn't something someone like you

132
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,959
can speak of.

133
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,399
You're worse than pigs and dogs.

134
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,199
I've offended you, sir.

135
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,240
Please forgive me.

136
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,399
Please forgive me.

137
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,199
Spare me, sir!

138
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,079
Get lost.

139
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,680
Thank you, sir.

140
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,199
That works too.

141
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,480
Why didn't I think of that sooner?

142
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,160
Thank you.

143
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,839
Good thing you stepped in.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,160
That's how I kept my innocence.

145
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,399
But

146
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,319
Didn't you say

147
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,920
I get hit by Charm Poison every time?

148
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:05,959
You...

149
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,199
I've tried all sorts of ways before

150
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,879
to help you detox.

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,319
But none of them worked.

152
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,639
Just now, I don't know why

153
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,360
I wanted to block the poison for you.

154
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,439
I didn't expect

155
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,240
it would actually work.

156
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,399
So

157
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,560
Will you be okay?

158
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,720
It's nothing serious.

159
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,759
More or less.

160
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,720
I'll die from the poison before dawn.

161
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:30,839
I know.

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,000
You're the little saintess of Forget Immortal Sect.

163
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,120
Your innocence

164
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,240
and reputation

165
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,600
matter more than life.

166
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,519
I don't expect you to cure me.

167
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,639
Go.

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
Otherwise, when the poison acts up

169
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,519
I won't be able to control myself.

170
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,879
Then

171
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
I'll go.

172
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,279
If what you said is true

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,040
and you've saved me so many times,

174
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,160
then this time

175
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,720
let me save you.

176
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,120
But you and the Seven Sins Demon Emperor—

177
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,440
Enough.

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,080
Saving you comes first.

179
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
Just to be clear,

180
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,519
this is definitely not a trick.

181
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,440
Another boring day.

182
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,960
The cycle repeats again.

183
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,879
I even had a dream.

184
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,679
Where am I?

185
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,519
Where's my thatched hut?

186
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
Didn't you say after sleeping

187
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,559
I'd return to yesterday?

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,200
You...

189
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
You liar!

190
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,679
Why are you here?

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,399
Did we reincarnate together?

192
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,279
Forget it.

193
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,559
If it's a scam, so be it.

194
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,159
I'll just admit I'm dumb.

195
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,440
That's why I fell for it.

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,840
What day is it today?

197
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,159
Is it the 9th?

198
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,159
Yesterday was the 9th.

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,559
Today is the 10th.

200
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,159
Yesterday...

201
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,399
What happened yesterday?

202
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,120
You saved me from Situ Jue.

203
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,639
Then you got hit by Charm Poison.

204
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
And then...

205
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,399
You don't have to pretend you forgot.

206
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,360
I won't cling to you.

207
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,159
100,000 years...

208
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,240
It's been 100,000 years. I finally—

209
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,799
I've been trapped for 100,000 years.

210
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
At last,

211
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,639
I'm

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,679
out

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
now!

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,919
Yi Yi

215
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,200
What are you doing?

216
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,559
I'll kill you first

217
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,879
then take my own life.

218
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,320
Stop messing around.

219
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,159
Don't come any closer.

220
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,320
Or I'll end myself first

221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,840
and then kill you.

222
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,080
Why do you have so many daggers?

223
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,279
You don't understand.

224
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,840
I was born...

225
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
You have an Innate Spiritual Body.

226
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
Chosen as the Little Saintess of Forget Immortal Sect.

227
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,720
In one year,

228
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,399
you'll be sacrificed to the Seven Sins Demon Emperor.

229
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,399
So,

230
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,120
you don't want to drag me down with you.

231
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,879
Isn't that right?

232
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,120
Yi Yi,

233
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,399
this time,

234
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,159
I won't let anyone take you away.

235
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,799
I'll defeat the Seven Sins Demon Emperor.

236
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,759
Can you beat him?

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,759
I can't.

238
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,679
He's killed me tens of thousands of times.

239
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,240
But this time,

240
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,159
for you,

241
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,799
I will win.

242
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,519
But you're only in the Mortal Realm.

243
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,240
So,

244
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,320
I need to get stronger.

245
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,759
I need more allies.

246
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,279
You brazen thief!

247
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,799
How dare you abduct the Little Saintess of Forget Immortal Sect!
