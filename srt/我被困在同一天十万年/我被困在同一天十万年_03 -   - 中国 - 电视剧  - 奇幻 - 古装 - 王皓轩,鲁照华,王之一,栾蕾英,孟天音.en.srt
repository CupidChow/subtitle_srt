1
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,079
Run!

2
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,079
Even together, we can't beat him.

3
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,680
What are you doing?

4
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,680
Who said I was going to fight him?

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,079
My Blade Intent

6
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,280
is completely unleashed.

7
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,280
Just dodge the first seven moves.

8
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,799
After he finishes seven moves,

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
remember to be on his right side

10
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,359
and counter with the Tenth Stance.

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,319
Mad Blade Seventh Stance!

12
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,040
Sword fanatic, now's your chance!

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,760
Bloodthirsty Flash!

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
Intent leads, energy follows.

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,240
Form at the center, Sword Intent controls the blade.

16
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,240
Blade channels energy, sword aura strikes the enemy.

17
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,000
See?

18
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,240
You've grasped it, haven't you?

19
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,199
Interesting.

20
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,479
You actually know the flaw in my seventh move.

21
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,000
Not just the seventh move,

22
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,280
your tenth move has an even bigger flaw.

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,719
Arrogant brat!

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
I'll tear you to pieces!

25
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,520
Mad Blade Tenth Stance!

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,599
Heaven-Shattering, Earth-Destroying!

27
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
Impossible!

28
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,560
How did the Heaven-Shattering Tenth Stance

29
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,000
get blocked and break by a mere branch?

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,840
Then what's the point of this blade?

31
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,599
What's the use?

32
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,039
The blade just backfired on me.

33
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,360
I almost destroyed myself.

34
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,120
Though you broke my blade,

35
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,479
I still thank you for saving my life.

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,719
It wasn't me who broke your blade.

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
It was your own Tenth Stance.

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,039
Mad Blade Tenth Stance, Heaven-Shattering, Earth-Destroying,

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,240
is certainly fierce and strong,

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,000
but the hardest steel is vulnerable to the softest touch.

41
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,719
I used the opposite Blade Intent

42
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,520
to strike your blade.

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,599
That triggered the blade's backlash.

44
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,360
So,

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
what broke wasn't the blade itself,

46
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,400
but your Blade Intent.

47
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,759
I see.

48
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,039
How did you know all this?

49
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,159
With soul as companion, blood as restraint.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
My name is Long Lin, my blade is Long Lin.

51
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,439
I am Lin Yue.

52
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
The Little Saint King of the Wangxian Sect.

53
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,479
And a lover of blades.

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,400
If Elder Long Lin doesn't mind,

55
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,120
I'll help you refine your Blade Intent from now on.

56
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,400
To a higher level.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,879
Little Saint King,

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,879
I didn't expect your understanding of Blade Intent to be so profound.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,319
So, about my earlier offer,

60
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,960
what do you think, Elder Long Lin?

61
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,639
Long Lin swears to follow the Little Saint King to the death!

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Is this the legendary

63
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,199
Elder Long Lin who bows to no one?

64
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,800
I, Long Lin, only submit to the strong.

65
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,720
Especially

66
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,920
to those who truly understand Blade Intent, like the Little Saint King.

67
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,759
That kid must have something going on with the Sect Leader.

68
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,120
Otherwise, how could he be named Saint King?

69
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,319
Father.

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,639
I can't accept this.

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,519
You think I can?

72
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm furious!

73
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Father.

74
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,720
I figured it out.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,759
Yesterday, I poisoned Qin Yiyi with Charm Poison.

76
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,199
He must have cured her.

77
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,199
And took her body.

78
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,920
The Sect Leader kept it secret

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,839
by making him the Little Saint King.

80
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,720
Do you want to sleep with the Little Saintess?

81
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,800
Do you know whose woman she is?

82
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,680
The point is, you haven't succeeded.

83
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,199
I knew you couldn't handle big things.

84
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,040
Didn't expect you can't even mess things up.

85
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,800
You're driving me mad.

86
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,079
Father.

87
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,000
With this leverage,

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
how could he possibly survive?

89
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,720
Who keeps wishing for my death every day?

90
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,319
Your guards here are useless.

91
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,000
You brat,

92
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,480
You barged into hell with no way out.

93
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
I'll make you die right here.

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,519
Xuanyou.

95
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,680
How dare you disrespect me?

96
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,160
What's your title in Chixiao Pavilion?

97
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,720
Can't answer?

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
I'll kill you right now.

99
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,879
My title

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
isn't something you can know.

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,759
Do you really have the guts to attack me?

102
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,639
Good thing I took notes.

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,480
It's been a hundred thousand years.

104
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,839
I've mixed up all the intel.

105
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,800
These notes are worse than nothing.

106
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,399
If you were truly the Emissary,

107
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,720
you wouldn't fear my Xuanyou Netherfire.

108
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,720
With my current cultivation, I can't withstand it.

109
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,399
Why does this Netherfire have black energy mixed in?

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Father.

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,839
He's panicking.

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,560
He's panicking.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,160
He's definitely a fake.

114
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,480
If he were really the Emissary,

115
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
I'd call him father.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,959
The antidote for the Flood Dragon Poison Pill—

117
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,959
Don't you want it anymore?

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,720
Father.

119
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:41,959
Father, father!

120
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,639
Father, father, you—

121
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,360
You—no...

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,439
No, you— I...

123
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,519
Jue'er, kneel quickly!

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,079
Only the true Emissary

125
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,759
would know about the Flood Dragon Poison Pill.

126
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,439
I, your servant Xuanyou,

127
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,279
greet you, father.

128
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,040
No.

129
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,720
Greetings, Emissary.

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,279
You two, father and son,

131
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,000
almost ruined my plans.

132
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,079
Do you realize your mistake?

133
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,959
Please forgive me, Emissary.

134
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,480
It's all my fault for being blind.

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,120
It's all because—

136
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,920
It's all because you sowed discord.

137
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,240
It was clearly you!

138
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,560
Still dare to talk back?

139
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,399
Emissary.

140
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,639
The Flood Dragon poison has worsened lately.

141
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,120
Please, Emissary, grant me the antidote.

142
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,279
If Xuanyou finds out

143
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,759
this is just a digestive pill,

144
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,279
he'd go crazy on me.

145
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,959
Getting the antidote isn't that easy.

146
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,879
Finish everything I ordered,

147
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,279
and you'll get it when it's done.

148
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,319
Yes, yes, yes.

149
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,399
What do you see in that guy?

150
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,240
He's the one I've been looking for.

151
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,199
Look at you.

152
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,199
Are you still the aloof Little Saintess I know?

153
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,279
Did he drug you or something?

154
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,560
No, he didn't.

155
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,800
You don't understand.

156
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,959
If he ever lets you down,

157
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll chop him up.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,399
To defeat the Seven Tribulations Demon Emperor,

159
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,519
we need a thorough plan.

160
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,120
Every step must be flawless.

161
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,480
Target the Demon Emperor's cultivation weak point.

162
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,639
Choose the perfect battlefield.

163
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,159
Gather the best from the Hongmeng Continent.

164
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,879
The sharpest top-tier artifacts.

165
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,720
Find the four major star regions.

166
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
The perfect counter techniques.

167
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,639
Follow this plan,

168
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,840
and we'll surely defeat the Demon Emperor.

169
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,639
If you force a breakthrough,

170
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,679
your meridians will be hard to heal.

171
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,279
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

172
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,480
I know you set up a forbidden array at the Supreme Pool.

173
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
You placed a restriction formation.

174
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,720
Since you know,

175
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,879
you still dare to come in?

176
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,200
To show my sincerity.

177
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,039
Only this way

178
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
can you let down your guard.

179
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,679
and let me help you break through.
