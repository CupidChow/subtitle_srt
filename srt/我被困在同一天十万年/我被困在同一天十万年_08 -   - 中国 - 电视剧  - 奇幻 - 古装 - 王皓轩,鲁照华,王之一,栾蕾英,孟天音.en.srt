1
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,799
I,

2
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,560
will personally send you off.

3
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,200
Don't be afraid, it'll be quick.

4
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,879
Finally dropped the act.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,040
Why are you always here?

6
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,120
Come on, finish him.

7
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,319
Hurry, go!

8
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,640
No,

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,959
I... I...

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,480
Me.

11
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,480
Never thought my own uncle

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,840
would be so ruthless.

13
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,400
Sorry, Young Master Lin.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,959
I was ignorant before.

15
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,000
It's fine, don't worry about it.

16
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,359
I'll protect you on this journey.

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,719
Night King City, I'm back!

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,400
By order of Lord Jun Wushang, the City Master,

19
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,520
the Aura Testing Array is now open.

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,159
Anyone with a score over one thousand

21
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,479
will receive ten thousand Luminous Pearls.

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,879
Over five thousand

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,479
will get twenty thousand Luminous Pearls.

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,319
Whoever can break Lord Jun Wushang's

25
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,599
record of one hundred thousand Aura Value

26
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,439
will be awarded a thousand acres of fertile land

27
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,840
and one hundred thousand Luminous Pearls.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,439
I'll go.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Thank you for letting me try.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
Impressive, really impressive!

31
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,520
Not bad!

32
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,280
Move aside, move aside!

33
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,159
Move!

34
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,960
Look at that.

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,240
So much aura!

36
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,800
Alright.

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,280
Amazing!

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,000
Impressive.

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,919
Really impressive.

40
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,400
S-sorry.

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:39,879
Sorry.

42
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,479
It's okay.

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
Did I say you could leave?

44
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,400
No.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,479
Today,

46
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,159
I'll teach you a little lesson.

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
So you watch where you're going next time.

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,840
Beat him up!

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,319
Keep running!

50
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,280
You wanna run?

51
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,199
Try running!

52
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,879
Run, run!

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,599
Stop!

54
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,639
I told you to teach him a lesson.

55
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,560
Do you know what "little" means?

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,479
Brother,

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,479
Are you alright?

58
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,319
My men were a bit rough.

59
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,199
Here are some Luminous Pearls.

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Take it as compensation for medical expenses.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,720
Thank you.

62
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,040
In broad daylight,

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,639
you're robbing people?

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,240
Today,

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm going to uphold justice!

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,519
Beat him up!

67
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Hit him harder!

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,519
Grab it!

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,480
Do you know him?

70
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,279
He's memorable.

71
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,000
Why are you here?

72
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,720
Who is this kid?

73
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,560
Do you know him?

74
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,560
No, I don't.

75
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,000
Come with me.

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,600
Keep your hands to yourself.

77
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,560
Looking for trouble?

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,759
Young Master.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,399
I'm in a good mood today.

80
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,240
I'll play with you.

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,759
How do you want to play?

82
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,480
See that Testing Array?

83
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,759
Go test yourself.

84
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,040
If your Aura Value is lower than mine,

85
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,040
you must die today.

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,079
What if it's higher than yours?

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,319
Then I'll

88
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,079
let you go.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
It exploded!

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,480
The Aura Value is too low to register.

91
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,439
Hit him!

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,439
Stop!

93
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,560
Xiaoyue

94
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,519
Why are you here?

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm just messing around with this bumpkin.

96
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,439
The testing array malfunctioned.

97
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,680
The previous test was invalid.

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,959
Xiaoyue

99
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,040
Why are you siding with this bumpkin?

100
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,279
You can call me Young Master.

101
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,680
Or Night Mingyue.

102
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,879
If you dare call me Xiaoyue again,

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,480
I'll break your legs.

104
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,680
There you go, getting angry again.

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

106
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,079
Aren't you leaving yet?

107
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,439
Get lost.

108
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,360
Thank you, Miss Ye, for helping me out.

109
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,160
Young master, do you know me?

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,199
We've met a few times, I think.

111
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,879
But you probably don't remember me.

112
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,399
May I ask your name, young master?

113
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,959
In a few days, your father Jun Wushang will come to see me.

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,240
You'll know then.

115
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,279
Let's go.

116
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,639
The array has never malfunctioned before.

117
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,720
Why did it happen this time?

118
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,600
This person's Aura Value

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,519
has already exceeded the array's limit.

120
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,800
What?

121
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,319
Send someone to follow him.

122
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,759
Find out his background.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,360
Yes.

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,319
Sir,

125
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,680
Are you here to dine or stay?

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,439
To stay.

127
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,360
This way, please.

128
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,040
Come, eat, have some food.

129
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,360
What are you looking for?

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,720
A bunch of useless fools.

131
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,399
Please calm down, Young Master.

132
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,320
This person's identity

133
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,399
We've already investigated it.

134
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,080
His name is Lin Yue.

135
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,240
He came to Night King City this time

136
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,200
to attend the auction.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,919
It seems

138
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,879
I'll have to handle this myself.

139
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,679
Sir, what would you like to eat?

140
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,679
What do you have here?

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,720
Here,

142
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,679
we have fine wine and great food, all for you.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,759
Alright.

144
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,639
Please, have a seat.

145
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Miss Ye, are you

146
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,240
trying to make friends with Young Master Lin?

147
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,960
If I remember correctly,

148
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,559
I don't think I've told you yet,

149
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,440
that my surname is Lin.

150
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,639
Young Master Lin's Aura Value test was impressive.

151
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,320
Of course I paid special attention.

152
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,759
Indeed.

153
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
I did look into some things.

154
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,840
So you had people follow me?

155
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,200
The good wine is here.

156
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,360
Young Master Lin,

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
I'll drink one as an apology.

158
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,440
I won't be drinking as punishment.

159
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,600
I was hoping

160
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,279
to have a few more drinks with you,

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,399
and talk about my troubles.

162
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,639
It seems

163
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,759
I won't get that chance.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,759
You're the Young Master of Night King City,

165
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,679
with every luxury at your disposal.

166
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,919
What troubles could you possibly have?

167
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,159
In this vast Night King City,

168
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,559
I don't even have a friend to drink and confide in.

169
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,600
Tell me,

170
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,960
isn't that a kind of trouble?

171
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,279
Today,

172
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,399
I just wanted someone to drink with,

173
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,759
to ease my worries.

174
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,320
Young Master Lin,

175
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,159
surely you won't deny me this small favor,

176
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,360
will you?

177
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,240
Then I would be honored to oblige.

178
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,799
How are you so good at drinking?

179
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,759
Trying to get me drunk?

180
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,360
You're still too inexperienced.

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,279
Impossible.

182
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,679
Since I was a child,

183
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,200
I've treated wine like water.

184
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,240
I've never met a match.

185
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,200
You know,

186
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,480
I've been drinking for a hundred thousand years.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,120
Who exactly are you?
