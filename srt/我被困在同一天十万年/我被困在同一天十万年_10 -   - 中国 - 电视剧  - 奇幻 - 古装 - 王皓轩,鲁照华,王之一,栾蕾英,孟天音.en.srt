1
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,760
How about

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,879
you go report first?

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,079
We've had good revenue lately.

4
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,480
The City Lord will definitely be pleased.

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,519
You go first.

6
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,680
You're good-looking,

7
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,760
and you speak well.

8
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,359
No matter what, the City Lord won't get mad at you.

9
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,760
What are you two talking about?

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,640
Are you plotting rebellion?

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,920
Young Lord.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,120
The City Lord just finished his retreat.

13
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,239
He wants us to report to him.

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,680
All matters during his retreat.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,959
We're struggling with it.

16
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,519
Then just report honestly.

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,799
He won't beat you up, will he?

18
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,120
What's going on?

19
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,280
What did you do?

20
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,439
A batch of Luminous Pearls was stolen from the city.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,439
I failed to supervise properly.

22
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,680
Young Lord.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
You saw it yourself.

24
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,959
I can't explain.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,599
I'll go take a look.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,519
Careful, careful.

27
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,040
Father.

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,479
You just finished your retreat and you're already so angry?

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,080
My precious Yue'er.

30
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,919
It's been days since I saw you.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,159
I've missed you so much.

32
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,080
Really?

33
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,800
Then why do I feel

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,240
you only care about your Night King's Divine Art?

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,800
How's it going?

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,360
Did you break through the eighth level?

37
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,599
I've made some progress, yes.

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,599
But cultivation

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,000
isn't like finding a son-in-law.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
You can't rush it.

41
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,680
Let's get back to business.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,159
It's just some Luminous Pearls that were stolen.

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,840
Father.

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,319
Is that worth getting so angry at Steward Zhou?

45
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,719
This is no small matter.

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,879
Didn't you always teach me

47
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,000
to treat subordinates kindly?

48
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,840
Otherwise,

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,800
they'll lose heart.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,560
Yue'er,

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,000
you're now the Young Lord of Night King City.

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,719
You must be cautious in everything.

53
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,520
This isn't just about some Luminous Pearls.

54
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,039
Our Night King City is tightly guarded.

55
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,800
It's as solid as a fortress.

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
What thief would dare target us?

57
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:02,919
Father.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,280
You mean

59
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,840
Steward Zhou stole them himself?

60
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,400
There's no such thing as a small matter in the city.

61
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,159
If we don't punish strictly,

62
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,439
our city's defenses

63
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,280
could collapse from a tiny breach.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,240
Yue'er,

65
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,599
you've been managing city affairs for me these days.

66
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,680
Anything important

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,719
to report to me?

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,680
Not really.

69
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,759
Just routine stuff.

70
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,000
I heard a young man

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,919
actually broke my Luminous Qi record.

72
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,280
He even broke the testing bronze mirror.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,039
You're talking about him?

74
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,039
Nothing to worry about.

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,039
Really?

76
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,000
But you've lost to him

77
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,800
twice already.

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Lin Yue and I became friends after a fight.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,039
We're on good terms now.

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,520
Then I'd like to meet this Lin Yue.

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,479
I'll bring him here.

82
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,319
No need.

83
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,400
I've already sent someone to invite him.

84
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,719
Once he gets out of the Maze of Bizarre Stones,

85
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,840
we'll meet naturally.

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,240
Monkey Mind Array.

87
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,079
Mortal-Immortal Tribulation.

88
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,439
The initial split of two extremes.

89
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,360
Sun, moon, and stars move.

90
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,839
This Maze of Bizarre Stones is very dangerous.

91
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,000
What if he can't get out?

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,560
Then he's not worthy to date you.

93
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,639
This guy

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
is the one you chose.

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,759
Doesn't he even have this much willpower?

96
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,959
Yiyi

97
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
Brother Lin Yue

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,240
Yiyi

99
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,600
We’ll always be together.

100
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,560
Lin Yue

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,319
Let’s stay here together.

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
It’s so joyful.

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Okay.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
Brother Lin Yue

105
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,279
I’ll do whatever you say.

106
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,959
Alright.

107
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,519
Lin Yue

108
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,879
Brother Lin Yue

109
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,279
Lin Yue

110
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:42,920
Is that alright?

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,959
Let’s play together.

112
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,839
Stay here.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,639
Alright, alright.

114
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,240
Stay here.

115
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,800
Alright, alright.

116
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,720
Okay.

117
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,680
City Lord

118
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,519
So Lin Yue is trapped before the Monkey Mind Array.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
His mind is restless and distracted.

120
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,439
He keeps saying

121
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
he wants to carve something on the stone.

122
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,040
Words of love.

123
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
No, I have to save him.

124
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,079
Wait.

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,759
He has to escape on his own.

126
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,519
What if he can’t get out?

127
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,079
Then I’ll...

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,839
I was planning to deal with him myself.

129
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,680
Yue’er

130
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,800
You are the future City Lord of Night King City.

131
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,199
When dealing with people,

132
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,800
you can’t rely only on fleeting feelings.

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,480
This person

134
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,800
must have enough ability to support you.

135
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,639
Character and cultivation,

136
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,560
including luck,

137
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,600
must all be excellent.

138
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,079
Otherwise, he’s not worthy of you.

139
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,319
Yue’er,

140
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
I’ve worried about this for you,

141
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,759
night after night.

142
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,759
I’ve truly worried myself sick.

143
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,120
City Lord, the Young Lord has already left.

144
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,199
It seems Yue’er

145
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,079
really cares about Lin Yue.

146
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,560
Where is he?

147
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,560
Could he have been swallowed by the array?

148
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,800
City Lord

149
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,720
It’s our first meeting,

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,360
and you’re making me learn such advanced arrays.

151
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,639
I really can’t handle it.

152
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,360
Young Hero Lin is truly talented.

153
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,160
He treats these ancient arrays as nothing.

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,959
His character and cultivation are rare in this world.

155
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,079
These arrays are nothing special.

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Night King City itself is a massive array.

157
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,480
It’s closely connected to the City Lord’s Divine Art of the Night King.

158
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,800
As long as you stand at the array’s core,

159
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,079
and operate the grand array,

160
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,600
you’ll be invincible.

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,959
Now that’s true power.

162
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,360
You know all this?

163
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,560
But there’s a fatal flaw.

164
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Tell me.

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,360
Qian Zun, Yao Ling

166
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,120
Kun Shun, Nei Ying

167
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,279
This part is a bit complicated to understand.

168
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,720
I’m sure no one’s interested.

169
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,759
Let me skip ahead.

170
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,000
Your enemies will have nowhere to run.

171
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,040
Father

172
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,560
Is everything he said true?

173
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,040
Young Master Lin, you truly are impressive.

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,639
Such a generous gift for our first meeting.

175
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,800
Speak.

176
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,519
What do you want from me?

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't want anything.

178
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,680
I just want to

179
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,759
be friends with you, Lord of the City.

180
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,079
I don't believe that's your real motive.

181
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,720
But as for this friendship,

182
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,240
I accept it.

183
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,320
Yue'er.

184
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,440
Young Master Lin is quite talented.

185
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,480
You two should get along well from now on.

186
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,080
Father.

187
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,240
It's getting late.

188
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,879
If you'll excuse me, I'll take my leave.

189
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,559
Wait.

190
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,480
I have one more important question.

191
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,039
If Young Master Lin

192
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,440
truly considers me, Jun Wushang, a friend,

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,000
then please answer honestly.

194
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,000
W-what is it?

195
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,759
May I ask,

196
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,799
are you married, Young Master Lin?

197
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,039
Father!

198
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,879
You're being ridiculous.

199
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,799
I'm not talking to you anymore.

200
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,240
No.

201
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,440
My daughter,

202
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,039
do you have someone special?

203
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,679
Do you think Miss Ye

204
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,120
can be won over?

205
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,200
Young Lord.

206
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,759
Forget about Miss Ye.

207
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,879
Even a grown man like me

208
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,480
would be moved by such a precious pearl.

209
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,720
It makes my heart flutter too.

210
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
Congratulations, Young Lord.

211
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,799
You'll surely succeed this time.

212
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,919
And win the beauty's heart.

213
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,720
Alright.

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,919
I'll take your good wishes.

215
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,360
If it works out,

216
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
there will be a big reward.

217
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,600
Thank you, Young Lord.

218
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,559
Much appreciated, Young Lord.

219
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,639
If it doesn't,

220
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,559
I'll have you castrated.

221
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,039
Miss Ye.

222
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,399
Miss Ye.

223
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,679
Xiao Yue.

224
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,639
Wait, wait!

225
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,720
Miss Ye.

226
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:56,879
Look.

227
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,440
Miss Ye.

228
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,000
My love for you is like this pearl.

229
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,039
Rare and one of a kind in this world.

230
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,440
Say something.

231
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,960
Young Lord.

232
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,120
Our Young Lord bought this pearl

233
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,679
for a hefty price at the East Sea Fish Market.

234
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,200
Please don't let his devotion go to waste.

235
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,440
That's right, Young Lord.

236
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Exactly, Xiao Yue.

237
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,919
That country bumpkin Lin Yue

238
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,919
in his whole life

239
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
could never buy you something this valuable.

240
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,320
Just look.

241
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,039
This pearl is really huge.

242
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,799
Do you like it?

243
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,000
If you do,

244
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,399
I'll buy you an even bigger one next time.

245
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,039
Look at yourself,

246
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,559
so dissipated and sleazy.

247
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,480
You need to fix yourself.

248
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,120
Stop comparing yourself to Lin Yue.

249
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,039
You're not worthy.

250
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,600
Even if he picks wildflowers by the roadside,

251
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,799
he's a hundred times better than you.

252
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,720
Are you alright, Young Lord?

253
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,320
Young Lord.

254
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,200
Yes, spit it out.

255
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,159
Quick, spit it out!

256
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,039
Spit! Spit!

257
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,279
Young Lord.

258
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:54,919
Are you okay, Young Lord?

259
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,279
Are you alright, Young Lord?

260
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm fine, I'm fine.

261
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,879
Alright.

262
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,679
You forced me.

263
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:07,879
Go.

264
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,399
Use the old way.
